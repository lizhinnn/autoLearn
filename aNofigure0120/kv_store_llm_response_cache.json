Identify Pole and Zero Locations**\n\n- **Poles**: The poles of the transfer function are the roots of the denominator. For this \\( G(s)H(s) \\), the poles are the solutions of \\( s^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10 = 0 \\).\n- **Zeros**: There are no finite zeros since the numerator \\( K \\) does not contribute any finite zeros.\n\n#### **2. Symmetry of the Root Locus**\n\nThe root locus plot is symmetric about the real axis, so it suffices to consider this symmetry while plotting.\n\n#### **3. Initial and Final Points**\n\n- **Start Points (Poles)**: The root locus branches start at the open-loop poles of the system.\n- **End Points (Zeros and Infinity)**: Since there are no finite zeros and there are four poles, and no zeros, the four branches of the root locus will end at infinity.\n\n#### **4. Real Axis Segment Rules**\n\nThe root locus exists on segments of the real axis to the left of an odd number of poles plus zeros. Identify these segments for the system:\n\n- Plotted on the sections of the real axis where it is to the left of an odd number of poles when considering each real point: this criteria applies specifically between the intervals of real poles.\n\n#### **5.

    "return": "## Root Locus Overview\n\nThe root locus is a graphical method used in control systems to analyze the movement of the poles in a feedback system as the gain, \\(K\\), varies. This technique is essential for determining system stability and designing control systems. It provides insight into how changes in system parameters affect dynamic behavior and helps in making decisions related to compensator design and gain selection.\n\n## Steps to Plot the Root Locus\n\n### Step 1: Characteristic Equation\n\nThe first step in constructing a root locus is to derive the characteristic equation from the open-loop transfer function. For the given system, \\(G(s)H(s) = \\frac{K^*}{s^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10}\\), the characteristic equation is:\n\n\\[ \n1 + G(s)H(s) = 0 \\implies 1 + \\frac{K^*}{s^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10} = 0 \n\\]\n\nThus, the characteristic equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \ns^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10 + K^* = 0 \n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Identify Open-Loop Poles and Zeros\n\nThe polynomial's roots from the denominator of \\(\\frac{1}{G(s)H(s)}\\) are the open-loop poles. In the absence of open-loop zeros for this system, we focus on the poles, which are:\n\n- \\(s_1\\), \\(s_2\\), \\(s_3\\), \\(s_4\\) from solving \\(s^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10 = 0\\).\n\n### Step 3: Sketch the Real Axis Portions\n\nFor the root locus on the real axis, the locus exists to the left of an odd number of real-axis open-loop poles and zeros. Since there are no zeros, consider the segments on the real axis between open-loop poles.\n\n### Step 4: Determine Asymptotes\n\nFor n poles and m zeros (here n = 4, m = 0), the number of asymptotes \\(n-m = 4\\). The asymptotes' angles are given by:\n\n\\[ \n\\angle \\theta = \\frac{(2q + 1)\\pi}{n - m} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad q = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-m-1 \n\\]\n\nThus, the angles are \\(45^\\circ\\), \\(135^\\circ\\), \\(225^\\circ\\), and \\(315^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 5: Calculate Breakaway and Break-in Points\n\nBreakaway and break-in points occur where the gain derivative \\(dK/ds = 0\\). This involves solving:\n\n\\[ \n\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{-P(s)}{Q(s)} \\right) = 0 \n\\]\n\nwhere \\(P(s) = K^*\\), and \\(Q(s) = s^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10\\).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Intersection with Imaginary Axis\n\nUse the Routh-Hurwitz criterion to determine the imaginary axis crossing by constructing the Routh array and find conditions that make some row zero, solving for s in \\(j\\omega\\).\n\n### Step 7: Sketch Root Locus \n\nFinally, plot the pole locations, the real-axis segments of the locus, and asymptotes' directions. The root locus should indicate how poles move from their initial positions (open-loop pole locations) to infinity as K increases.\n\n## Analysis Method for Each Step\n\n1. **Characteristic Equation**: Convert \\(1 + G(s)H(s) = 0\\) into polynomial form, handle algebraic expressions.\n\n2. **Locate Poles/Zeros**: Identify solutions of \\(s^4 + 4s^3 + 12s^2 + 20s + 10 = 0\\) for poles.\n\n3. **Real Axis Portions**: Use rules for checking segments based on odd/even rule of poles and zeros.\n\n4. **Asymptotes**: Calculate using the formula for angles and locate centroid for departures \\( \\frac{\\sum \\text{poles} - \\sum \\text{zeros}}{n-m} \\).\n\n5. **Break Points**: Derive and solve polynomial derivative equal to zero.\n\n6. **Imaginary Intersection**: Apply Routh array conditions to verify imaginary crossings.\n\n7. **Root Locus Sketch**: Plot using results from above steps, indicating the loci, breakaway points, and asymptote directions.\n\nThe root locus method provides a stepwise approach to understanding how the poles of your control system transition across the complex plane as the feedback gain varies—this insight aids in fine-tuning system performance and achieving desired stability characteristics.",

Identify the Real Axis Segments\n\nThe root locus will exist on real axis segments to the left of an odd number of real poles and zeros. As there are no zeros and potentially complex poles, you will need to analyze the real axis between the poles found.\n\n### 5. Asymptotes and Centroid\n\nThe asymptotes show directions in which locus branches tend towards infinity. The formula to calculate the angle of asymptotes is:\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\frac{(2q+1)\\pi}{n-m} \\]\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of poles, \\( m \\) is the number of zeros, and \\( q = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\).\n\nFor this system, \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( m = 0 \\), so:\n\\[ \\theta_a = \\frac{(2q+1)\\pi}{4} \\] \n\nThe centroid \\( \\sigma \\) of the asymptotes is given by:\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{\\sum \\text{(poles)} - \\sum \\text{(zeros)}}{n - m} \\]\n\nSolve for the centroid by computing the sum of poles and dividing by 4.\n\n### 6. Determine Breakaway and Break-in Points\n\nCompute the roots of the derivative of the characteristic equation with respect to \\( s \\), where multiple branches converge or diverge.\n\n### 7. Evaluate Departure and Arrival Angles\n\nIf there are complex conjugate poles or zeros, determine the departure or arrival angles at those poles using:\n\\[ \\phi_d = 180^\\circ + \\sum \\text{(angles to other poles)} - \\sum \\text{(angles to zeros)} \\]\n\n### 8. Draw the Root Locus\n\n- Plot the poles and zeros on the s-plane.\n- Draw the portions of the real axis that belong to the root locus.\n- Sketch the asymptotes emanating from the centroid.\n- Mark breakaway and break-in points if any.\n- Sketch paths between poles, including movements to infinity along asymptote directions.\n\n### Note\n\nAccurate sketching of the root locus is usually done with software or numerical solvers, especially for high-order systems like this one. Programs such as MATLAB can automate these steps for precise plots. Adjustments should be applied if a numerical solver finds it necessary.\n\nConsider running a MATLAB script to visualize this analysis effectively.
