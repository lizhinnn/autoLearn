Readers will find it to be a clear and understandable textbook for control system courses at colleges and universities. It is written for senior electrical, mechanical, aerospace, or chemical engineering students. The reader is expected to have fulfilled the following prerequisites: introductory courses on differential equations, Laplace transforms, vectormatrix analysis, circuit analysis, mechanics, and introductory thermodynamics.  \n\nThe main revisions made in this edition are as follows:  \n\n•The use of MATLAB for obtaining responses of control systems to various inputs has been increased.   \n•The usefulness of the computational optimization approach with MATLAB has been demonstrated.   \n•New example problems have been added throughout the book.   \n•Materials in the previous edition that are of secondary importance have been deleted in order to provide space for more important subjects. Signal flow graphs were dropped from the book. A chapter on Laplace transform was deleted. Instead, Laplace transform tables, and partial-fraction expansion with MATLAB are presented in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively.   \n•A short summary of vector-matrix analysis is presented in Appendix C; this will help the reader to find the inverses of n x n matrices that may be involved in the analysis and design of control systems.  \n\nThis edition of Modern Control Engineering is organized into ten chapters.The outline of this book is as follows: Chapter 1 presents an introduction to control systems. Chapter 2 deals with mathematical modeling of control systems.A linearization technique for nonlinear mathematical models is presented in this chapter. Chapter 3 derives mathematical models of mechanical systems and electrical systems. Chapter 4 discusses mathematical  \n\nmodeling of fluid systems (such as liquid-level systems, pneumatic systems, and hydraulic   \nsystems) and thermal systems. Chapter 5 treats transient response and steady-state analyses of control systems.   \nMATLAB is used extensively for obtaining transient response curves. Routh’s stability   \ncriterion is presented for stability analysis of control systems. Hurwitz stability criterion   \nis also presented. Chapter 6 discusses the root-locus analysis and design of control systems, including   \npositive feedback systems and conditionally stable systems Plotting root loci with MAT  \nLAB is discussed in detail. Design of lead, lag, and lag-lead compensators with the root  \nlocus method is included. Chapter 7 treats the frequency-response analysis and design of control systems.The   \nNyquist stability criterion is presented in an easily understandable manner.The Bode di  \nagram approach to the design of lead, lag, and lag-lead compensators is discussed. Chapter 8 deals with basic and modified PID controllers. Computational approaches   \nfor obtaining optimal parameter values for PID controllers are discussed in detail, par  \nticularly with respect to satisfying requirements for step-response characteristics. Chapter 9 treats basic analyses of control systems in state space. Concepts of con  \ntrollability and observability are discussed in detail. Chapter 10 deals with control systems design in state space.The discussions include   \npole placement, state observers, and quadratic optimal control. An introductory dis  \ncussion of robust control systems is presented at the end of Chapter 10. The book has been arranged toward facilitating the student’s gradual understanding   \nof control theory. Highly mathematical arguments are carefully avoided in the presen  \ntation of the materials. Statement proofs are provided whenever they contribute to the   \nunderstanding of the subject matter presented. Special effort has been made to provide example problems at strategic points so that   \nthe reader will have a clear understanding of the subject matter discussed. In addition,   \na number of solved problems (A-problems) are provided at the end of each chapter,   \nexcept Chapter 1.The reader is encouraged to study all such solved problems carefully;   \nthis will allow the reader to obtain a deeper understanding of the topics discussed. In   \naddition, many problems (without solutions) are provided at the end of each chapter,   \nexcept Chapter 1. The unsolved problems (B-problems) may be used as homework or   \nquiz problems. If this book is used as a text for a semester course (with 56 or so lecture hours),a good   \nportion of the material may be covered by skipping certain subjects. Because of the   \nabundance of example problems and solved problems (A-problems) that might answer   \nmany possible questions that the reader might have, this book can also serve as a self  \nstudy book for practicing engineers who wish to study basic control theories. I would like to thank the following reviewers for this edition of the book:Mark Camp  \nbell, Cornell University; Henry Sodano, Arizona State University; and Atul G. Kelkar,   \nIowa State University.Finally,I wish to offer my deep appreciation to Ms.Alice Dworkin,   \nAssociate Editor, Mr. Scott Disanno, Senior Managing Editor, and all the people in  \nvolved in this publishing project, for the speedy yet superb production of this book.  \n\nKatsuhiko Ogata  \n\n# Introduction to Control Systems  \n\n# 1–1 INTRODUCTION  \n\nControl theories commonly used today are classical control theory (also called conventional control theory), modern control theory, and robust control theory.This book presents comprehensive treatments of the analysis and design of control systems based on the classical control theory and modern control theory.A brief introduction of robust control theory is included in Chapter 10.  \n\nAutomatic control is essential in any field of engineering and science. Automatic control is an important and integral part of space-vehicle systems, robotic systems, modern manufacturing systems, and any industrial operations involving control of temperature, pressure, humidity, flow, etc. It is desirable that most engineers and scientists are familiar with theory and practice of automatic control.  \n\nThis book is intended to be a text book on control systems at the senior level at a college or university.All necessary background materials are included in the book. Mathematical background materials related to Laplace transforms and vector-matrix analysis are presented separately in appendixes.  \n\nBrief Review of Historical Developments of Control Theories and Practices. The first significant work in automatic control was James Watt’s centrifugal governor for the speed control of a steam engine in the eighteenth century. Other significant works in the early stages of development of control theory were due to Minorsky, Hazen, and Nyquist, among many others. In 1922, Minorsky worked on automatic controllers for steering ships and showed how stability could be determined from the differential equations describing the system. In 1932, Nyquist developed a relatively simple procedure for determining the stability of closed-loop systems on the basis of open-loop response to steady-state sinusoidal inputs. In 1934, Hazen, who introduced the term servomechanisms for position control systems, discussed the design of relay servomechanisms capable of closely following a changing input.  \n\nDuring the decade of the 1940s, frequency-response methods (especially the Bode diagram methods due to Bode) made it possible for engineers to design linear closedloop control systems that satisfied performance requirements. Many industrial control systems in 1940s and 1950s used PID controllers to control pressure, temperature, etc. In the early 1940s Ziegler and Nichols suggested rules for tuning PID controllers, called Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules. From the end of the 1940s to the 1950s, the root-locus method due to Evans was fully developed.  \n\nThe frequency-response and root-locus methods, which are the core of classical control theory, lead to systems that are stable and satisfy a set of more or less arbitrary performance requirements. Such systems are, in general, acceptable but not optimal in any meaningful sense. Since the late 1950s, the emphasis in control design problems has been shifted from the design of one of many systems that work to the design of one optimal system in some meaningful sense.  \n\nAs modern plants with many inputs and outputs become more and more complex, the description of a modern control system requires a large number of equations. Classical control theory, which deals only with single-input, single-output systems, becomes powerless for multiple-input, multiple-output systems. Since about 1960, because the availability of digital computers made possible time-domain analysis of complex systems, modern control theory, based on time-domain analysis and synthesis using state variables, has been developed to cope with the increased complexity of modern plants and the stringent requirements on accuracy, weight, and cost in military, space, and industrial applications.  \n\nDuring the years from 1960 to 1980, optimal control of both deterministic and stochastic systems, as well as adaptive and learning control of complex systems, were fully investigated. From 1980s to 1990s, developments in modern control theory were centered around robust control and associated topics.  \n\nModern control theory is based on time-domain analysis of differential equation systems. Modern control theory made the design of control systems simpler because the theory is based on a model of an actual control system. However, the system’s stability is sensitive to the error between the actual system and its model. This means that when the designed controller based on a model is applied to the actual system, the system may not be stable. To avoid this situation, we design the control system by first setting up the range of possible errors and then designing the controller in such a way that, if the error of the system stays within the assumed range, the designed control system will stay stable. The design method based on this principle is called robust control theory.This theory incorporates both the frequencyresponse approach and the time-domain approach.The theory is mathematically very complex.  \n\nBecause this theory requires mathematical background at the graduate level, inclusion of robust control theory in this book is limited to introductory aspects only. The reader interested in details of robust control theory should take a graduate-level control course at an established college or university.  \n\nDefinitions. Before we can discuss control systems, some basic terminologies must be defined.  \n\nControlled Variable and Control Signal or Manipulated Variable. The controlled variable is the quantity or condition that is measured and controlled.The control signal or manipulated variable is the quantity or condition that is varied by the controller so as to affect the value of the controlled variable. Normally, the controlled variable is the output of the system. Control means measuring the value of the controlled variable of the system and applying the control signal to the system to correct or limit deviation of the measured value from a desired value.  \n\nIn studying control engineering, we need to define additional terms that are necessary to describe control systems.  \n\nPlants. A plant may be a piece of equipment, perhaps just a set of machine parts functioning together, the purpose of which is to perform a particular operation. In this book, we shall call any physical object to be controlled (such as a mechanical device, a heating furnace, a chemical reactor, or a spacecraft) a plant.  \n\nProcesses. The Merriam–Webster Dictionary defines a process to be a natural, progressively continuing operation or development marked by a series of gradual changes that succeed one another in a relatively fixed way and lead toward a particular result or end; or an artificial or voluntary, progressively continuing operation that consists of a series of controlled actions or movements systematically directed toward a particular result or end. In this book we shall call any operation to be controlled a process. Examples are chemical, economic, and biological processes.  \n\nSystems. A system is a combination of components that act together and perform a certain objective. A system need not be physical. The concept of the system can be applied to abstract, dynamic phenomena such as those encountered in economics. The word system should,therefore,be interpreted to imply physical,biological,economic,and the like, systems.  \n\nDisturbances. A disturbance is a signal that tends to adversely affect the value of the output of a system. If a disturbance is generated within the system, it is called internal, while an external disturbance is generated outside the system and is an input.  \n\nFeedback Control. Feedback control refers to an operation that, in the presence of disturbances, tends to reduce the difference between the output of a system and some reference input and does so on the basis of this difference. Here only unpredictable disturbances are so specified, since predictable or known disturbances can always be compensated for within the system.  \n\nIn this section we shall present a few examples of control systems.  \n\nSpeed Control System. The basic principle of a Watt’s speed governor for an engine is illustrated in the schematic diagram of Figure 1–1. The amount of fuel admitted to the engine is adjusted according to the difference between the desired and the actual engine speeds.  \n\nThe sequence of actions may be stated as follows: The speed governor is adjusted such that, at the desired speed, no pressured oil will flow into either side of the power cylinder. If the actual speed drops below the desired value due to disturbance, then the decrease in the centrifugal force of the speed governor causes the control valve to move downward, supplying more fuel, and the speed of the engine increases until the desired value is reached. On the other hand, if the speed of the engine increases above the desired value, then the increase in the centrifugal force of the governor causes the control valve to move upward. This decreases the supply of fuel, and the speed of the engine decreases until the desired value is reached.  \n\nIn this speed control system, the plant (controlled system) is the engine and the controlled variable is the speed of the engine. The difference between the desired speed and the actual speed is the error signal.The control signal (the amount of fuel) to be applied to the plant (engine) is the actuating signal. The external input to disturb the controlled variable is the disturbance. An unexpected change in the load is a disturbance.  \n\nTemperature Control System. Figure 1–2 shows a schematic diagram of temperature control of an electric furnace.The temperature in the electric furnace is measured by a thermometer, which is an analog device.The analog temperature is converted to a digital temperature by an $\\mathbf{A}/\\mathbf{D}$ converter. The digital temperature is fed to a controller through an interface.This digital temperature is compared with the programmed input temperature, and if there is any discrepancy (error), the controller sends out a signal to the heater, through an interface, amplifier, and relay, to bring the furnace temperature to a desired value.  \n\nThe image depicts a diagram of an engine's fuel system, which is a critical component of its operation. The diagram shows how the fuel flows through various components to reach the engine.\n\n**Components of the Fuel System**\n\n*   **Fuel Tank**: The fuel tank is located at the bottom left corner of the diagram and contains the fuel for the engine.\n*   **Fuel Filter**: The fuel filter is connected to the fuel tank and removes impurities from the fuel before it enters the rest of the system.\n*   **Fuel Pump**: The fuel pump is a mechanical device that draws fuel from the tank and pumps it through the system. It is located near the fuel filter.\n*   **Fuel Injector Nozzle**: The fuel injector nozzle is a critical component of the fuel system, responsible for injecting fuel into the engine's combustion chamber at high pressure.\n*   **Air Intake Manifold**: The air intake manifold is connected to the top right corner of the diagram and draws in air from outside the vehicle. It then directs this air into the engine's cylinders.\n*   **Engine Block**: The engine block is where the actual combustion process takes place. It consists of several cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, camshafts, timing chains or belts, water pumps, and oil pumps.\n\n**How the Fuel System Works**\n\nThe fuel system works as follows:\n\n1.  **Fuel Flow**: The fuel flows from the tank through the filter and pump into the fuel injector nozzle.\n2.  **Injection**: The fuel is injected into the combustion chamber at high pressure by the fuel injector nozzle.\n3.  **Combustion**: The air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber ignites, producing power that drives the engine.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the diagram shows a typical fuel system for an internal combustion engine. It includes components such as the fuel tank, filter, pump, and injectors, which work together to deliver fuel to the engine's cylinders. The air intake manifold supplies air to the engine, while the engine block houses the pistons, connecting rods, crankshaft, camshafts, timing chains or belts, water pumps, and oil pumps that enable combustion to occur. Overall, this system is essential for maintaining proper engine performance and efficiency. 1–1 Speed control system.  \n\nThe image presents a diagram of an electric furnace system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the structure and relationships between these elements.\n\n*   **Electric Furnace**\n    *   The electric furnace is represented by a rectangle with a zigzag line inside it.\n    *   It is labeled as \"Electric furnace\" and has no subcomponents or statistics associated with it.\n*   **A/D Converter**\n    *   The A/D converter is depicted as a rectangle connected to the electric furnace via an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   It is labeled as \"A/D converter\" and has no additional information provided.\n*   **Interface**\n    *   The interface is illustrated as a rectangle with two arrows pointing out of it, one towards the electric furnace and another towards the A/D converter.\n    *   It is labeled as \"Interface\" and contains no statistics or subcomponents.\n*   **Amplifier**\n    *   The amplifier is shown as a rectangle connected to the interface via an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   It is labeled as \"Amplifier\" and lacks any supplementary details.\n*   **Controller**\n    *   The controller is represented by a rectangle with two arrows pointing out of it, one towards the amplifier and another towards the relay.\n    *   It is labeled as \"Controller\" and contains no statistics or subcomponents.\n*   **Relay**\n    *   The relay is illustrated as a rectangle connected to the controller via an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   It is labeled as \"Relay\" and has no additional information provided.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates the structure of an electric furnace system, including its various components such as the A/D converter, interface, amplifier, controller, and relay. These elements are interconnected to form a functional system that can be analyzed for performance and optimization purposes. 1–2 Temperature control system.  \n\nBusiness Systems. A business system may consist of many groups. Each task assigned to a group will represent a dynamic element of the system. Feedback methods of reporting the accomplishments of each group must be established in such a system for proper operation.The cross-coupling between functional groups must be made a minimum in order to reduce undesirable delay times in the system. The smaller this crosscoupling, the smoother the flow of work signals and materials will be.  \n\nA business system is a closed-loop system.A good design will reduce the managerial control required.Note that disturbances in this system are the lack of personnel or materials, interruption of communication, human errors, and the like.  \n\nThe establishment of a well-founded estimating system based on statistics is mandatory to proper management.It is a well-known fact that the performance of such a system can be improved by the use of lead time, or anticipation.  \n\nTo apply control theory to improve the performance of such a system, we must represent the dynamic characteristic of the component groups of the system by a relatively simple set of equations.  \n\nAlthough it is certainly a difficult problem to derive mathematical representations of the component groups, the application of optimization techniques to business systems significantly improves the performance of the business system.  \n\nConsider, as an example, an engineering organizational system that is composed of major groups such as management, research and development, preliminary design, experiments, product design and drafting, fabrication and assembling, and tesing. These groups are interconnected to make up the whole operation.  \n\nSuch a system may be analyzed by reducing it to the most elementary set of components necessary that can provide the analytical detail required and by representing the dynamic characteristics of each component by a set of simple equations. (The dynamic performance of such a system may be determined from the relation between progressive accomplishment and time.)  \n\nThe image depicts a flowchart that outlines the process of designing and manufacturing a product. The chart is divided into two sections, with the top section showing the steps involved in research and development and the bottom section illustrating the steps required for product design and testing.\n\n**Top Section: Research and Development**\n\n*   **Required Product**: This is the starting point of the flowchart, where the required product is identified.\n*   **Management**: The next step involves management, which includes planning, budgeting, and resource allocation.\n*   **Research and Development**: Following management, research and development are critical components of this stage. Research involves gathering data and information to support the product's concept, while development involves creating prototypes or models to test the product's functionality.\n*   **Preliminary Design**: After completing the research and development phase, a preliminary design is created. This design outlines the overall structure and layout of the product.\n\n**Bottom Section: Product Design and Testing**\n\n*   **Experiments**: In this stage, experiments are conducted to validate the preliminary design and gather data on its performance.\n*   **Product Design and Drafting**: Based on the results of the experiments, a detailed product design is created. This includes drafting plans for manufacturing and assembly.\n*   **Fabrication and Assembly**: With the final design in place, fabrication and assembly begin. This involves creating parts and components according to specifications and assembling them into a functional unit.\n*   **Testing**: The last step in the flowchart is testing. The product is subjected to various tests to ensure it meets performance standards and safety requirements.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the product design and development process. It highlights the importance of research and development, management, experimentation, and thorough testing to create a successful product. 1–3 Block diagram of an engineering organizational system.  \n\nA functional block diagram may be drawn by using blocks to represent the functional activities and interconnecting signal lines to represent the information or product output of the system operation. Figure 1–3 is a possible block diagram for this system.  \n\nRobust Control System. The first step in the design of a control system is to obtain a mathematical model of the plant or control object. In reality, any model of a plant we want to control will include an error in the modeling process.That is, the actual plant differs from the model to be used in the design of the control system.  \n\nTo ensure the controller designed based on a model will work satisfactorily when this controller is used with the actual plant, one reasonable approach is to assume from the start that there is an uncertainty or error between the actual plant and its mathematical model and include such uncertainty or error in the design process of the control system. The control system designed based on this approach is called a robust control system.  \n\nSuppose that the actual plant we want to control is $\\widetilde G(s)$ and the mathematical model of the actual plant is $G(s)$ , that is,  \n\n$\\begin{array}{l}{{\\widetilde{G}(s)\\,=\\,\\mathrm{actual~plant~model~that~has~uncertainty}\\;\\Delta(s)}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{G(s)\\,=\\,\\mathrm{nominal~plant~model~to~be~used~for~designing~the~cont}}}\\end{array}$ $\\widetilde G(s)$ and $G(s)$ may be related by a multiplicative factor such as  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{G}(s)\\,=\\,G(s)[1+\\Delta(s)]\n$$  \n\nor an additive factor  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{G}(s)\\,=\\,G(s)\\,+\\,\\Delta(s)\n$$  \n\nor in other forms.  \n\nSince the exact description of the uncertainty or error $\\Delta(s)$ is unknown, we use an estimate of $\\Delta(s)$ and use this estimate, $W(s)$ , in the design of the controller. $W(s)$ is a scalar transfer function such that  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Delta(s)\\|_{\\infty}<\\|W(s)\\|_{\\infty}=\\operatorname*{max}_{0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\infty}|W(j\\omega)|\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\|W(s)\\|_{\\infty}$ is the maximum value of $|W(j\\omega)|$ for $0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\infty$ and is called the H infinity norm of $W(s)$ .  \n\nUsing the small gain theorem, the design procedure here boils down to the determination of the controller $K(s)$ such that the inequality  \n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\frac{W(s)}{1+K(s)G(s)}\\right\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nis satisfied, where $G(s)$ is the transfer function of the model used in the design process, $K(s)$ is the transfer function of the controller, and $W(s)$ is the chosen transfer function to approximate $\\Delta(s)$ . In most practical cases, we must satisfy more than one such inequality that involves $G(s),K(s)$ , and $W(s)$ ’s. For example, to guarantee robust stability and robust performance we may require two inequalities, such as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left\\|\\frac{W_{m}(s)K(s)G(s)}{1\\,+\\,\\,K(s)G(s)}\\right\\|_{\\infty}<1\\quad\\mathrm{~for~robust~stability}}\\\\ &{\\left\\|\\frac{W_{s}(s)}{1\\,+\\,\\,K(s)G(s)}\\right\\|_{\\infty}<1\\quad\\mathrm{~for~robust~performance}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nbe satisfied. (These inequalities are derived in Section 10–9.) There are many different such inequalities that need to be satisfied in many different robust control systems. (Robust stability means that the controller $K(s)$ guarantees internal stability of all systems that belong to a group of systems that include the system with the actual plant. Robust performance means the specified performance is satisfied in all systems that belong to the group.) In this book all the plants of control systems we discuss are assumed to be known precisely, except the plants we discuss in Section 10–9 where an introductory aspect of robust control theory is presented.  \n\n# 1–3 CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL VERSUS OPEN-LOOP CONTROL  \n\nFeedback Control Systems. A system that maintains a prescribed relationship between the output and the reference input by comparing them and using the difference as a means of control is called a feedback control system. An example would be a roomtemperature control system. By measuring the actual room temperature and comparing it with the reference temperature (desired temperature), the thermostat turns the heating or cooling equipment on or off in such a way as to ensure that the room temperature remains at a comfortable level regardless of outside conditions.  \n\nFeedback control systems are not limited to engineering but can be found in various nonengineering fields as well.The human body, for instance, is a highly advanced feedback control system. Both body temperature and blood pressure are kept constant by means of physiological feedback. In fact, feedback performs a vital function: It makes the human body relatively insensitive to external disturbances, thus enabling it to function properly in a changing environment.  \n\nClosed-Loop Control Systems. Feedback control systems are often referred to as closed-loop control systems. In practice, the terms feedback control and closed-loop control are used interchangeably. In a closed-loop control system the actuating error signal, which is the difference between the input signal and the feedback signal (which may be the output signal itself or a function of the output signal and its derivatives and/or integrals), is fed to the controller so as to reduce the error and bring the output of the system to a desired value.The term closed-loop control always implies the use of feedback control action in order to reduce system error.  \n\nOpen-Loop Control Systems. Those systems in which the output has no effect on the control action are called open-loop control systems. In other words, in an openloop control system the output is neither measured nor fed back for comparison with the input. One practical example is a washing machine. Soaking, washing, and rinsing in the washer operate on a time basis. The machine does not measure the output signal, that is, the cleanliness of the clothes.  \n\nIn any open-loop control system the output is not compared with the reference input. Thus, to each reference input there corresponds a fixed operating condition; as a result, the accuracy of the system depends on calibration. In the presence of disturbances, an open-loop control system will not perform the desired task. Open-loop control can be used, in practice, only if the relationship between the input and output is known and if there are neither internal nor external disturbances. Clearly, such systems are not feedback control systems. Note that any control system that operates on a time basis is open loop. For instance, traffic control by means of signals operated on a time basis is another example of open-loop control.  \n\nClosed-Loop versus Open-Loop Control Systems. An advantage of the closedloop control system is the fact that the use of feedback makes the system response relatively insensitive to external disturbances and internal variations in system parameters. It is thus possible to use relatively inaccurate and inexpensive components to obtain the accurate control of a given plant, whereas doing so is impossible in the open-loop case.  \n\nFrom the point of view of stability, the open-loop control system is easier to build because system stability is not a major problem. On the other hand, stability is a major problem in the closed-loop control system, which may tend to overcorrect errors and thereby can cause oscillations of constant or changing amplitude.  \n\nIt should be emphasized that for systems in which the inputs are known ahead of time and in which there are no disturbances it is advisable to use open-loop control. Closed-loop control systems have advantages only when unpredictable disturbances and/or unpredictable variations in system components are present. Note that the output power rating partially determines the cost, weight, and size of a control system. The number of components used in a closed-loop control system is more than that for a corresponding open-loop control system. Thus, the closed-loop control system is generally higher in cost and power.To decrease the required power of a system, openloop control may be used where applicable. A proper combination of open-loop and closed-loop controls is usually less expensive and will give satisfactory overall system performance.  \n\nMost analyses and designs of control systems presented in this book are concerned with closed-loop control systems. Under certain circumstances (such as where no disturbances exist or the output is hard to measure) open-loop control systems may be desired.Therefore, it is worthwhile to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of using open-loop control systems.  \n\nThe major advantages of open-loop control systems are as follows:   \n1. Simple construction and ease of maintenance.   \n2. Less expensive than a corresponding closed-loop system.   \n3. There is no stability problem.   \n4. Convenient when output is hard to measure or measuring the output precisely is economically not feasible.(For example,in the washer system,it would be quite expensive to provide a device to measure the quality of the washer’s output, cleanliness of the clothes.)   \nThe major disadvantages of open-loop control systems are as follows:   \n1. Disturbances and changes in calibration cause errors, and the output may be different from what is desired.   \n2. To maintain the required quality in the output, recalibration is necessary from time to time.  \n\n# 1–4 DESIGN AND COMPENSATION OF CONTROL SYSTEMS  \n\nThis book discusses basic aspects of the design and compensation of control systems. Compensation is the modification of the system dynamics to satisfy the given specifications.The approaches to control system design and compensation used in this book are the root-locus approach, frequency-response approach, and the state-space approach. Such control systems design and compensation will be presented in Chapters 6, 7, 9 and 10. The PID-based compensational approach to control systems design is given in Chapter 8.  \n\nIn the actual design of a control system, whether to use an electronic, pneumatic, or hydraulic compensator is a matter that must be decided partially based on the nature of the controlled plant. For example, if the controlled plant involves flammable fluid, then we have to choose pneumatic components (both a compensator and an actuator) to avoid the possibility of sparks. If, however, no fire hazard exists, then electronic compensators are most commonly used.(In fact,we often transform nonelectrical signals into electrical signals because of the simplicity of transmission, increased accuracy, increased reliability, ease of compensation, and the like.)  \n\nPerformance Specifications. Control systems are designed to perform specific tasks. The requirements imposed on the control system are usually spelled out as performance specifications.The specifications may be given in terms of transient response requirements (such as the maximum overshoot and settling time in step response) and of steady-state requirements (such as steady-state error in following ramp input) or may be given in frequency-response terms. The specifications of a control system must be given before the design process begins.  \n\nFor routine design problems, the performance specifications (which relate to accuracy, relative stability, and speed of response) may be given in terms of precise numerical values.In other cases they may be given partially in terms of precise numerical values and partially in terms of qualitative statements. In the latter case the specifications may have to be modified during the course of design, since the given specifications may never be satisfied (because of conflicting requirements) or may lead to a very expensive system.  \n\nGenerally, the performance specifications should not be more stringent than necessary to perform the given task. If the accuracy at steady-state operation is of prime importance in a given control system, then we should not require unnecessarily rigid performance specifications on the transient response, since such specifications will require expensive components. Remember that the most important part of control system design is to state the performance specifications precisely so that they will yield an optimal control system for the given purpose.  \n\nSystem Compensation. Setting the gain is the first step in adjusting the system for satisfactory performance. In many practical cases, however, the adjustment of the gain alone may not provide sufficient alteration of the system behavior to meet the given specifications. As is frequently the case, increasing the gain value will improve the steady-state behavior but will result in poor stability or even instability. It is then necessary to redesign the system (by modifying the structure or by incorporating additional devices or components) to alter the overall behavior so that the system will behave as desired. Such a redesign or addition of a suitable device is called compensation. A device inserted into the system for the purpose of satisfying the specifications is called a compensator. The compensator compensates for deficient performance of the original system.  \n\nDesign Procedures. In the process of designing a control system, we set up a mathematical model of the control system and adjust the parameters of a compensator. The most time-consuming part of the work is the checking of the system performance by analysis with each adjustment of the parameters.The designer should use MATLAB or other available computer package to avoid much of the numerical drudgery necessary for this checking.  \n\nOnce a satisfactory mathematical model has been obtained, the designer must construct a prototype and test the open-loop system. If absolute stability of the closed loop is assured, the designer closes the loop and tests the performance of the resulting closedloop system. Because of the neglected loading effects among the components, nonlinearities, distributed parameters, and so on, which were not taken into consideration in the original design work, the actual performance of the prototype system will probably differ from the theoretical predictions. Thus the first design may not satisfy all the requirements on performance. The designer must adjust system parameters and make changes in the prototype until the system meets the specificications. In doing this, he or she must analyze each trial, and the results of the analysis must be incorporated into the next trial.The designer must see that the final system meets the performance apecifications and, at the same time, is reliable and economical.  \n\n# 1–5 OUTLINE OF THE BOOK  \n\nThis text is organized into 10 chapters.The outline of each chapter may be summarized   \nas follows: Chapter 1 presents an introduction to this book.  \n\nChapter 2 deals with mathematical modeling of control systems that are described by linear differential equations. Specifically, transfer function expressions of differential equation systems are derived.Also, state-space expressions of differential equation systems are derived. MATLAB is used to transform mathematical models from transfer functions to state-space equations and vice versa.This book treats linear systems in detail. If the mathematical model of any system is nonlinear, it needs to be linearized before applying theories presented in this book. A technique to linearize nonlinear mathematical models is presented in this chapter.  \n\nChapter 3 derives mathematical models of various mechanical and electrical systems that appear frequently in control systems.  \n\nChapter 4 discusses various fluid systems and thermal systems, that appear in control systems.Fluid systems here include liquid-level systems,pneumatic systems,and hydraulic systems. Thermal systems such as temperature control systems are also discussed here. Control engineers must be familiar with all of these systems discussed in this chapter.  \n\nChapter 5 presents transient and steady-state response analyses of control systems defined in terms of transfer functions. MATLAB approach to obtain transient and steady-state response analyses is presented in detail. MATLAB approach to obtain three-dimensional plots is also presented. Stability analysis based on Routh’s stability criterion is included in this chapter and the Hurwitz stability criterion is briefly discussed.  \n\nChapter 6 treats the root-locus method of analysis and design of control systems. It is a graphical method for determining the locations of all closed-loop poles from the knowledge of the locations of the open-loop poles and zeros of a closed-loop system as a parameter (usually the gain) is varied from zero to infinity. This method was developed by W. R. Evans around 1950. These days MATLAB can produce root-locus plots easily and quickly.This chapter presents both a manual approach and a MATLAB approach to generate root-locus plots. Details of the design of control systems using lead compensators, lag compensators, are lag–lead compensators are presented in this chapter.  \n\nChapter 7 presents the frequency-response method of analysis and design of control systems. This is the oldest method of control systems analysis and design and was developed during 1940–1950 by Nyquist, Bode, Nichols, Hazen, among others.This chapter presents details of the frequency-response approach to control systems design using lead compensation technique, lag compensation technique, and lag–lead compensation technique. The frequency-response method was the most frequently used analysis and design method until the state-space method became popular. However, since H-infinity control for designing robust control systems has become popular, frequency response is gaining popularity again.  \n\nChapter 8 discusses PID controllers and modified ones such as multidegrees-offreedom PID controllers.The PID controller has three parameters; proportional gain, integral gain, and derivative gain. In industrial control systems more than half of the controllers used have been PID controllers.The performance of PID controllers depends on the relative magnitudes of those three parameters. Determination of the relative magnitudes of the three parameters is called tuning of PID controllers.  \n\nZiegler and Nichols proposed so-called “Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules” as early as 1942. Since then numerous tuning rules have been proposed.These days manufacturers of PID controllers have their own tuning rules. In this chapter we present a computer optimization approach using MATLAB to determine the three parameters to satisfy given transient response characteristics.The approach can be expanded to determine the three parameters to satisfy any specific given characteristics.  \n\nChapter 9 presents basic analysis of state-space equations. Concepts of controllability and observability, most important concepts in modern control theory, due to Kalman are discussed in full. In this chapter, solutions of state-space equations are derived in detail.  \n\nChapter 10 discusses state-space designs of control systems.This chapter first deals with pole placement problems and state observers.In control engineering,it is frequently desirable to set up a meaningful performance index and try to minimize it (or maximize it, as the case may be). If the performance index selected has a clear physical meaning, then this approach is quite useful to determine the optimal control variable.This chapter discusses the quadratic optimal regulator problem where we use a performance index which is an integral of a quadratic function of the state variables and the control variable.The integral is performed from $t\\,=\\,0$ to $t\\,=\\,\\infty,$ .This chapter concludes with a brief discussion of robust control systems.  \n\n# Mathematical Modeling of Control Systems  \n\nIn studying control systems the reader must be able to model dynamic systems in mathematical terms and analyze their dynamic characteristics.A mathematical model of a dynamic system is defined as a set of equations that represents the dynamics of the system accurately, or at least fairly well. Note that a mathematical model is not unique to a given system.A system may be represented in many different ways and, therefore, may have many mathematical models, depending on one’s perspective.  \n\nThe dynamics of many systems, whether they are mechanical, electrical, thermal, economic, biological, and so on, may be described in terms of differential equations. Such differential equations may be obtained by using physical laws governing a particular system—for example, Newton’s laws for mechanical systems and Kirchhoff’s laws for electrical systems. We must always keep in mind that deriving reasonable mathematical models is the most important part of the entire analysis of control systems.  \n\nThroughout this book we assume that the principle of causality applies to the systems considered.This means that the current output of the system (the output at time $t\\,=\\,0$ )depends on the past input (the input for $t<0$ ) but does not depend on the future input (the input for $t>0$ ).  \n\nMathematical Models. Mathematical models may assume many different forms. Depending on the particular system and the particular circumstances, one mathematical model may be better suited than other models. For example, in optimal control problems, it is advantageous to use state-space representations. On the other hand, for the transient-response or frequency-response analysis of single-input, single-output, linear, time-invariant systems, the transfer-function representation may be more convenient than any other. Once a mathematical model of a system is obtained, various analytical and computer tools can be used for analysis and synthesis purposes.  \n\nSimplicity Versus Accuracy. In obtaining a mathematical model, we must make a compromise between the simplicity of the model and the accuracy of the results of the analysis. In deriving a reasonably simplified mathematical model, we frequently find it necessary to ignore certain inherent physical properties of the system. In particular, if a linear lumped-parameter mathematical model (that is, one employing ordinary differential equations) is desired, it is always necessary to ignore certain nonlinearities and distributed parameters that may be present in the physical system. If the effects that these ignored properties have on the response are small,good agreement will be obtained between the results of the analysis of a mathematical model and the results of the experimental study of the physical system.  \n\nIn general,in solving a new problem,it is desirable to build a simplified model so that we can get a general feeling for the solution.A more complete mathematical model may then be built and used for a more accurate analysis.  \n\nWe must be well aware that a linear lumped-parameter model,which may be valid in low-frequency operations,may not be valid at sufficiently high frequencies,since the neglected property of distributed parameters may become an important factor in the dynamic behavior of the system. For example, the mass of a spring may be neglected in lowfrequency operations, but it becomes an important property of the system at high frequencies.(For the case where a mathematical model involves considerable errors,robust control theory may be applied. Robust control theory is presented in Chapter 10.)  \n\nLinear Systems. A system is called linear if the principle of superposition applies. The principle of superposition states that the response produced by the simultaneous application of two different forcing functions is the sum of the two individual responses. Hence, for the linear system, the response to several inputs can be calculated by treating one input at a time and adding the results. It is this principle that allows one to build up complicated solutions to the linear differential equation from simple solutions.  \n\nIn an experimental investigation of a dynamic system, if cause and effect are proportional, thus implying that the principle of superposition holds, then the system can be considered linear.  \n\nLinear Time-Invariant Systems and Linear Time-Varying Systems. A differential equation is linear if the coefficients are constants or functions only of the independent variable. Dynamic systems that are composed of linear time-invariant lumped-parameter components may be described by linear time-invariant differential equations—that is, constant-coefficient differential equations. Such systems are called linear time-invariant (or linear constant-coefficient ) systems. Systems that are represented by differential equations whose coefficients are functions of time are called linear time-varying systems. An example of a time-varying control system is a spacecraft control system. (The mass of a spacecraft changes due to fuel consumption.)  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. Section 2–1 has presented an introduction to the mathematical modeling of dynamic systems. Section 2–2 presents the transfer function and impulse-response function. Section 2–3 introduces automatic control systems and Section 2–4 discusses concepts of modeling in state space. Section 2–5 presents state-space representation of dynamic systems. Section 2–6 discusses transformation of mathematical models with MATLAB. Finally, Section 2–7 discusses linearization of nonlinear mathematical models.  \n\n# 2–2 TRANSFER FUNCTION AND IMPULSERESPONSE FUNCTION  \n\nIn control theory, functions called transfer functions are commonly used to characterize the input-output relationships of components or systems that can be described by linear, time-invariant, differential equations. We begin by defining the transfer function and follow with a derivation of the transfer function of a differential equation system. Then we discuss the impulse-response function.  \n\nTransfer Function. The transfer function of a linear, time-invariant, differential equation system is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output (response function) to the Laplace transform of the input (driving function) under the assumption that all initial conditions are zero.  \n\nConsider the linear time-invariant system defined by the following differential equation:  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l l}{a_{0}^{(n)}~+~a_{1}^{(n-1)}\\quad\\cdot\\cdot+~a_{n-1}{\\dot{y}}~+~a_{n}y}\\\\ &{~}&{=b_{0}^{{\\mathrm{(}}m)}~+~b_{1}x^{\\mathrm{(}}+\\cdots+~b_{m-1}{\\dot{x}}~+~b_{m}x\\qquad(n\\geq m)}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $y$ is the output of the system and $x$ is the input.The transfer function of this system is the ratio of the Laplace transformed output to the Laplace transformed input when all initial conditions are zero, or  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\mathrm{Transfer~function}}=G(s)={\\frac{{\\mathcal{L}}[{\\mathrm{output}}]}{{\\mathcal{L}}[{\\mathrm{input}}]}}\\bigg|_{z{\\mathrm{ero}}\\;{\\mathrm{initial}}\\;{\\mathrm{conditions}}}}\\\\ &{={\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}}={\\frac{b_{0}s^{m}\\;+\\;b_{1}s^{m-1}\\;+\\;\\cdots\\;+\\;b_{m-1}s\\;+\\;b_{m}}{a_{0}s^{n}\\;+\\;a_{1}s^{n-1}\\;+\\;\\cdots\\;+\\;a_{n-1}s\\;+\\;a_{n}}}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nBy using the concept of transfer function, it is possible to represent system dynamics by algebraic equations in $s.$ If the highest power of $s$ in the denominator of the transfer function is equal to $n$ , the system is called an nth-order system .  \n\nComments on Transfer Function. The applicability of the concept of the transfer function is limited to linear, time-invariant, differential equation systems.The transfer function approach, however, is extensively used in the analysis and design of such systems. In what follows, we shall list important comments concerning the transfer function.(Note that a system referred to in the list is one described by a linear,time-invariant, differential equation.)  \n\n1. The transfer function of a system is a mathematical model in that it is an operational method of expressing the differential equation that relates the output variable to the input variable.   \n2. The transfer function is a property of a system itself, independent of the magnitude and nature of the input or driving function.   \n3. The transfer function includes the units necessary to relate the input to the output; however, it does not provide any information concerning the physical structure of the system. (The transfer functions of many physically different systems can be identical.)   \n4. If the transfer function of a system is known, the output or response can be studied for various forms of inputs with a view toward understanding the nature of the system.   \n5. If the transfer function of a system is unknown, it may be established experimentally by introducing known inputs and studying the output of the system. Once established, a transfer function gives a full description of the dynamic characteristics of the system, as distinct from its physical description.  \n\nConvolution Integral. For a linear, time-invariant system the transfer function $G(s)$ is  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $X(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the input to the system and $Y(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the output of the system, where we assume that all initial conditions involved are zero.It follows that the output $Y(s)$ can be written as the product of $G(s)$ and $X(s)$ , or  \n\n$$\nY(s)\\,=\\,G(s)X(s)\n$$  \n\nNote that multiplication in the complex domain is equivalent to convolution in the time domain (see Appendix A), so the inverse Laplace transform of Equation (2–1) is given by the following convolution integral:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle y(t)\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{t}\\!x(\\tau)g(t\\,-\\,\\tau)\\,d\\tau}\\\\ {\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{t}\\!g(\\tau)x(t\\,-\\,\\tau)\\,d\\tau}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere both $g(t)$ and $x(t)$ are 0 for $t<0$ .  \n\nImpulse-Response Function. Consider the output (response) of a linear timeinvariant system to a unit-impulse input when the initial conditions are zero. Since the Laplace transform of the unit-impulse function is unity, the Laplace transform of the output of the system is  \n\n$$\nY(s)=G(s)\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of the output given by Equation (2–2) gives the impulse response of the system.The inverse Laplace transform of $G(s)$ , or  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\big[G(s)\\big]\\,=\\,g(t)\n$$  \n\nis called the impulse-response function. This function $g(t)$ is also called the weighting function of the system.  \n\nThe impulse-response function $g(t)$ is thus the response of a linear time-invariant system to a unit-impulse input when the initial conditions are zero.The Laplace transform of this function gives the transfer function. Therefore, the transfer function and impulse-response function of a linear, time-invariant system contain the same information about the system dynamics. It is hence possible to obtain complete information about the dynamic characteristics of the system by exciting it with an impulse input and measuring the response. (In practice, a pulse input with a very short duration compared with the significant time constants of the system can be considered an impulse.)  \n\n# 2–3 AUTOMATIC CONTROL SYSTEMS  \n\nA control system may consist of a number of components. To show the functions performed by each component, in control engineering, we commonly use a diagram called the block diagram . This section first explains what a block diagram is. Next, it discusses introductory aspects of automatic control systems, including various control actions.Then,it presents a method for obtaining block diagrams for physical systems,and, finally, discusses techniques to simplify such diagrams.  \n\nBlock Diagrams. A block diagram of a system is a pictorial representation of the functions performed by each component and of the flow of signals. Such a diagram depicts the interrelationships that exist among the various components. Differing from a purely abstract mathematical representation, a block diagram has the advantage of indicating more realistically the signal flows of the actual system.  \n\nFigure 2–1   \nElement of a block diagram.  \n\nIn a block diagram all system variables are linked to each other through functional blocks.The functional block or simply block is a symbol for the mathematical operation on the input signal to the block that produces the output.The transfer functions of the components are usually entered in the corresponding blocks, which are connected by arrows to indicate the direction of the flow of signals. Note that the signal can pass only in the direction of the arrows.Thus a block diagram of a control system explicitly shows a unilateral property.  \n\nFigure 2–1 shows an element of the block diagram.The arrowhead pointing toward the block indicates the input, and the arrowhead leading away from the block represents the output. Such arrows are referred to as signals .  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a transfer function, which is a mathematical representation of the relationship between the input and output of a system. The diagram consists of two main components: the input signal and the transfer function.\n\n*   **Input Signal**\n    *   The input signal is represented by an arrow pointing towards the left side of the diagram.\n    *   It is not explicitly labeled but can be inferred as the input to the system being modeled.\n*   **Transfer Function**\n    *   The transfer function is a rectangular box with the label \"G(s)\" inside it, indicating that it represents a complex function of the Laplace variable s.\n    *   The transfer function is often used in control systems and signal processing to analyze and design systems that can be described by linear differential equations.\n\nThe diagram suggests that the input signal passes through the transfer function, which processes the signal according to its defined mathematical rules. This processed output signal then emerges from the right side of the block diagram, but it is not explicitly labeled in this particular diagram.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a visual representation of how an input signal interacts with a transfer function to produce an output signal. While the specific details of the transfer function are not provided, the diagram illustrates the fundamental concept of how such functions can be used to model and analyze complex systems.  \n\nNote that the dimension of the output signal from the block is the dimension of the input signal multiplied by the dimension of the transfer function in the block.  \n\nThe advantages of the block diagram representation of a system are that it is easy to form the overall block diagram for the entire system by merely connecting the blocks of the components according to the signal flow and that it is possible to evaluate the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the system.  \n\nIn general, the functional operation of the system can be visualized more readily by examining the block diagram than by examining the physical system itself. A block diagram contains information concerning dynamic behavior, but it does not include any information on the physical construction of the system. Consequently, many dissimilar and unrelated systems can be represented by the same block diagram.  \n\nIt should be noted that in a block diagram the main source of energy is not explicitly shown and that the block diagram of a given system is not unique.A number of different block diagrams can be drawn for a system, depending on the point of view of the analysis.  \n\nThe image depicts a simple electronic circuit symbol, which is commonly used to represent an operation or process in electrical engineering and other fields. The circuit consists of two input terminals labeled \"a\" and \"b\", connected to a central component with a minus sign (-) inside it.\n\n*   **Input Terminal 1 (a):**\n    *   Located on the left side of the circuit.\n    *   Has an arrow pointing towards the center, indicating that it is an input signal.\n    *   Typically represents the first value or quantity being processed in the operation.\n*   **Central Component:**\n    *   Contains a minus sign (-) inside it, suggesting subtraction or negation operation.\n    *   Often represents a mathematical operation such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), etc., depending on the context and conventions used.\n*   **Input Terminal 2 (b):**\n    *   Located on the right side of the circuit.\n    *   Also has an arrow pointing towards the center, indicating that it is another input signal.\n    *   Represents the second value or quantity being processed in the operation.\n\nIn summary, this symbol represents a basic arithmetic operation where two values are subtracted from each other. The output of this operation would be the result of the subtraction between the inputs \"a\" and \"b\", which can be represented mathematically as: **output = a - b**. This symbol is widely used in various fields such as electronics, computer science, and mathematics to represent subtraction operations in digital circuits or algorithms.  \n\nFigure 2–2 Summing point.  \n\nSumming Point. Referring to Figure 2–2, a circle with a cross is the symbol that indicates a summing operation. The plus or minus sign at each arrowhead indicates whether that signal is to be added or subtracted. It is important that the quantities being added or subtracted have the same dimensions and the same units.  \n\nBranch Point. A branch point is a point from which the signal from a block goes concurrently to other blocks or summing points.  \n\nBlock Diagram of a Closed-Loop System. Figure 2–3 shows an example of a block diagram of a closed-loop system. The output $C(s)$ is fed back to the summing point, where it is compared with the reference input $R(s)$ . The closed-loop nature of the system is clearly indicated by the figure. The output of the block, $C(s)$ in this case, is obtained by multiplying the transfer function $G(s)$ by the input to the block, $E(s)$ .Any linear control system may be represented by a block diagram consisting of blocks, summing points, and branch points.  \n\nWhen the output is fed back to the summing point for comparison with the input, it is necessary to convert the form of the output signal to that of the input signal. For example, in a temperature control system, the output signal is usually the controlled temperature.The output signal, which has the dimension of temperature, must be converted to a force or position or voltage before it can be compared with the input signal. This conversion is accomplished by the feedback element whose transfer function is $H(s)$ ,as shown in Figure 2–4.The role of the feedback element is to modify the output before it is compared with the input.(In most cases the feedback element is a sensor that measures  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a common tool used to model and analyze complex systems. The diagram consists of several blocks connected by arrows, each representing a different component or process within the system.\n\nHere are the main points describing the image:\n\n*   **Summing point**\n    *   Located at the top left of the diagram\n    *   Represents the summing of two signals: an input signal (R(s)) and an error signal (E(s))\n    *   The output of this block is the control signal (C(s)) that drives the system\n*   **Block G(s)**\n    *   Located to the right of the summing point\n    *   Represents a transfer function or a mathematical model of a physical component, such as an amplifier or filter\n    *   The input to this block is the control signal (C(s)), and the output is the response signal (Y(s))\n*   **Block C(s)**\n    *   Located at the bottom right of the diagram\n    *   Represents another transfer function or mathematical model, possibly representing a different component or subsystem within the system\n    *   The input to this block is also the control signal (C(s)), and the output is another response signal (Y'(s))\n*   **Arrows**\n    *   Connect each block to its inputs and outputs, indicating the flow of signals through the system\n    *   Arrows pointing upwards indicate a positive feedback loop, while arrows pointing downwards indicate a negative feedback loop\n\nIn summary, this block diagram represents a control system with multiple components and transfer functions. The summing point at the top left combines an input signal and error signal to produce a control signal that drives the system. The blocks G(s) and C(s) represent different components or subsystems within the system, each processing the control signal to produce response signals Y(s) and Y'(s), respectively. 2–3 Block diagram of a closed-loop system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The diagram is structured as follows:\n\n*   **Input Signal (R(s))**: The input signal to the system is represented by R(s).\n*   **Controller (E(s))**: The controller processes the input signal to generate an error signal E(s). This component is crucial for regulating the system's behavior.\n*   **Process (G(s))**: The process, denoted as G(s), transforms the output of the controller into a new signal. This transformation is essential for achieving the desired outcome.\n*   **Sensor (H(s))**: The sensor measures the actual output of the system and provides feedback to the controller in the form of H(s). This feedback loop enables continuous monitoring and adjustment of the system's performance.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   The block diagram illustrates a closed-loop control system, where the feedback from the sensor is used to adjust the input signal.\n*   Each component (controller, process, and sensor) has its own transfer function represented by s), indicating that they are modeled using mathematical equations involving the Laplace transform variable s).\n*   The arrows connecting these components represent the flow of signals between them.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, this block diagram depicts a typical control system architecture consisting of an input signal, controller, process, and sensor. These elements work together to regulate the system's behavior based on feedback from the sensor, allowing for continuous monitoring and adjustment of performance.  \n\nFigure 2–4 Closed-loop system.  \n\nthe output of the plant.The output of the sensor is compared with the system input, and the actuating error signal is generated.) In the present example, the feedback signal that is fed back to the summing point for comparison with the input is $B(s)=H(s)C(s)$ .  \n\nOpen-Loop Transfer Function and Feedforward Transfer Function. Referring to Figure 2–4, the ratio of the feedback signal $B(s)$ to the actuating error signal $E(s)$ is called the open-loop transfer function .That is,  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Open-loop~transfer~function}}={\\frac{B(s)}{E(s)}}=G(s)H(s)\n$$  \n\nThe ratio of the output $C(s)$ to the actuating error signal $E(s)$ is called the feedforward transfer function , so that  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Feedforward~transfer~function}}={\\frac{C(s)}{E(s)}}=G(s)\n$$  \n\nIf the feedback transfer function $H(s)$ is unity, then the open-loop transfer function and the feedforward transfer function are the same.  \n\nClosed-Loop Transfer Function. For the system shown in Figure 2–4, the output $C(s)$ and input $R(s)$ are related as follows: since  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{C(s)=G(s)E(s)}}\\\\ {{E(s)=R(s)\\,-\\,B(s)}}\\\\ {{\\qquad=\\,R(s)\\,-\\,H(s)C(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\neliminating $E(s)$ from these equations gives  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{C(s)=G(s)\\big[R(s)\\,-\\,H(s)C(s)\\big]}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle\\qquad\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function relating $C(s)$ to $R(s)$ is called the closed-loop transfer function . It relates the closed-loop system dynamics to the dynamics of the feedforward elements and feedback elements.  \n\nFrom Equation $(2{-}3),C(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}\\,R(s)\n$$  \n\nThus the output of the closed-loop system clearly depends on both the closed-loop transfer function and the nature of the input.  \n\nObtaining Cascaded, Parallel, and Feedback (Closed-Loop) Transfer Functions with MATLAB. In control-systems analysis, we frequently need to calculate the cascaded transfer functions, parallel-connected transfer functions, and feedback-connected (closed-loop) transfer functions. MATLAB has convenient commands to obtain the cascaded, parallel, and feedback (closed-loop) transfer functions.  \n\nSuppose that there are two components $G_{1}(s)$ and $G_{2}(s)$ connected differently as shown in Figure 2–5 (a), (b), and (c), where  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)=\\frac{\\mathrm{num}1}{\\mathrm{den1}},~~~~~G_{2}(s)=\\frac{\\mathrm{num}2}{\\mathrm{den}2}\n$$  \n\nTo obtain the transfer functions of the cascaded system, parallel system, or feedback (closed-loop) system, the following commands may be used:  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{[\\mathsf{n u m},\\,\\mathsf{d e n}]=\\mathsf{s e r i e s}(\\mathsf{n u m}1,\\mathsf{d e n}1,\\mathsf{n u m}2,\\mathsf{d e n}2)}\\\\ &{[\\mathsf{n u m},\\,\\mathsf{d e n}]=\\mathsf{p a r a l l e l}(\\mathsf{n u m}1,\\mathsf{d e n}1,\\mathsf{n u m}2,\\mathsf{d e n}2)}\\\\ &{[\\mathsf{n u m},\\,\\mathsf{d e n}]=\\mathsf{f e e d b a c k}(\\mathsf{n u m}1,\\mathsf{d e n}1,\\mathsf{n u m}2,\\mathsf{d e n}2)}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nAs an example, consider the case where  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)=\\frac{10}{s^{2}+2s+10}=\\frac{\\mathrm{num1}}{\\mathrm{den}1},\\qquad G_{2}(s)=\\frac{5}{s+5}=\\frac{\\mathrm{num2}}{\\mathrm{den}2}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 2–1 gives $C(s)/R(s)\\,=\\,\\mathrm{num}/$ 'den for each arrangement of $G_{1}(s)$ and $G_{2}(s)$ .Note that the command  \n\ndisplays the num 'den that is,the transfer function $C(s)/R(s)]$ of the system considered.  \n\nThe image displays three block diagrams, each with a different configuration of blocks and arrows. The purpose of these diagrams is to represent signal flow in various systems.\n\n*   **Block Diagram 1**\n    *   The first diagram has two blocks: G1(s) and G2(s).\n    *   There are no inputs or outputs shown.\n    *   No title or description for this block diagram.\n*   **Block Diagram 2**\n    *   This diagram has three blocks: R(s), G1(s), and G2(s).\n    *   The output of R(s) is connected to the input of G1(s).\n    *   The output of G1(s) is connected to the input of G2(s).\n    *   No title or description for this block diagram.\n*   **Block Diagram 3**\n    *   This diagram has four blocks: R(s), G1(s), G2(s), and C(s).\n    *   The output of R(s) is connected to both inputs of G1(s) and G2(s).\n    *   The outputs of G1(s) and G2(s) are summed together before being fed into C(s).\n    *   No title or description for this block diagram.\n\nIn summary, the image presents three different block diagrams representing various signal flow configurations. Each diagram consists of multiple blocks connected by arrows, but lacks any descriptive text or titles to provide context about their purpose or function. 2–5 (a) Cascaded system; (b) parallel system; (c) feedback (closedloop) system.   \nChapter 2 /Mathematical Modeling of Control Systems  \n\nThe image displays a mathematical equation, specifically a MATLAB program for solving partial differential equations. The title at the top of the page reads \"MATLAB Program 2_1\" in bold black font.\n\nBelow the title, there are two lines of code written in a monospaced font:\n\n*   `num1 = [10];`\n*   `den1 = [12 10];`\n\nThese codes appear to be defining variables and initializing them with specific values. The first line sets `num1` equal to an array containing the number 10, while the second line defines `den1` as another array.\n\nUnderneath these lines of code, there is a mathematical equation presented in a more traditional format:\n\n*   $\\frac{5s^2 + 20s + 100}{s^3 + 7s^2 + 20s + 50}$\n\nThis equation represents a fraction with polynomials in both the numerator and denominator. The numerator has a leading coefficient of 5, followed by terms involving powers of s up to the second power. Similarly, the denominator consists of polynomial terms up to the third power.\n\nOverall, this image seems to be illustrating how MATLAB can be used to solve complex mathematical equations, particularly those involving partial differential operators. By defining variables and using built-in functions within the program, it is possible to break down and analyze these intricate equations in a more manageable way.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of an automatic control system, comprising various components and connections. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the flow of signals within the system.\n\n*   **Automatic Controller**\n    *   This component receives reference inputs and produces error signals.\n    *   It then generates actuating signals based on these errors.\n    *   The controller's output is connected to an amplifier, which boosts the signal before it reaches the plant or process being controlled.\n*   **Amplifier**\n    *   This block increases the magnitude of the actuating signal from the automatic controller.\n    *   Its primary function is to amplify the input signal without altering its characteristics.\n*   **Plant/Process**\n    *   Represented by a box labeled \"Plant,\" this component receives the amplified signal from the amplifier and responds accordingly.\n    *   The plant's output is fed back to the automatic controller, forming a closed-loop system.\n*   **Sensors**\n    *   Not explicitly shown in the diagram but implied by the feedback loop connection between the plant and the automatic controller.\n    *   These sensors measure the process variable (output) of the plant and provide this information as an input to the automatic controller.\n*   **Error Detector**\n    *   This component compares the reference input with the actual output from the plant, producing an error signal.\n    *   The error detector's output is used by the automatic controller to adjust its actuating signal.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a basic closed-loop control system where the automatic controller adjusts its output based on errors detected between desired and actual outputs. The amplifier enhances the control signal before it affects the plant or process being controlled. Feedback from sensors allows continuous monitoring and adjustment of the control loop for optimal performance. 2–6 Block diagram of an industrial control system, which consists of an automatic controller, an actuator, a plant, and a sensor (measuring element).  \n\nAutomatic Controllers. An automatic controller compares the actual value of the plant output with the reference input (desired value), determines the deviation, and produces a control signal that will reduce the deviation to zero or to a small value. The manner in which the automatic controller produces the control signal is called the control action . Figure 2–6 is a block diagram of an industrial control system, which consists of an automatic controller, an actuator, a plant, and a sensor (measuring element). The controller detects the actuating error signal, which is usually at a very low power level, and amplifies it to a sufficiently high level. The output of an automatic controller is fed to an actuator, such as an electric motor, a hydraulic motor, or a pneumatic motor or valve. (The actuator is a power device that produces the input to the plant according to the control signal so that the output signal will approach the reference input signal.)  \n\nThe sensor or measuring element is a device that converts the output variable into another suitable variable,such as a displacement,pressure,voltage,etc.,that can be used to compare the output to the reference input signal.This element is in the feedback path of the closed-loop system.The set point of the controller must be converted to a reference input with the same units as the feedback signal from the sensor or measuring element.  \n\nClassifications of Industrial Controllers. Most industrial controllers may be classified according to their control actions as:  \n\n1. Two-position or on–off controllers   \n2. Proportional controllers   \n3. Integral controllers   \n4. Proportional-plus-integral controllers   \n5. Proportional-plus-derivative controllers   \n6. Proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative controllers  \n\nMost industrial controllers use electricity or pressurized fluid such as oil or air as power sources. Consequently, controllers may also be classified according to the kind of power employed in the operation, such as pneumatic controllers, hydraulic controllers, or electronic controllers. What kind of controller to use must be decided based on the nature of the plant and the operating conditions, including such considerations as safety, cost, availability, reliability, accuracy, weight, and size.  \n\nTwo-Position or On–Off Control Action. In a two-position control system, the actuating element has only two fixed positions, which are, in many cases, simply on and off.Two-position or on–off control is relatively simple and inexpensive and, for this reason, is very widely used in both industrial and domestic control systems.  \n\nLet the output signal from the controller be $u(t)$ and the actuating error signal be $e(t)$ .In two-position control, the signal $u(t)$ remains at either a maximum or minimum value, depending on whether the actuating error signal is positive or negative, so that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{u(t)=U_{1},}&{{}}&{\\mathrm{for}\\;e(t)>0}\\\\ {=U_{2},}&{{}}&{\\mathrm{for}\\;e(t)<0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$ are constants. The minimum value $U_{2}$ is usually either zero or $-U_{1}$ .Two-position controllers are generally electrical devices, and an electric solenoid-operated valve is widely used in such controllers.Pneumatic proportional controllers with very high gains act as two-position controllers and are sometimes called pneumatic twoposition controllers.  \n\nFigures 2–7(a) and (b) show the block diagrams for two-position or on–off controllers. The range through which the actuating error signal must move before the switching occurs is called the differential gap . A differential gap is indicated in Figure 2–7(b). Such a differential gap causes the controller output $u(t)$ to maintain its present value until the actuating error signal has moved slightly beyond the zero value.In some cases,the differential gap is a result of unintentional friction and lost motion; however, quite often it is intentionally provided in order to prevent too-frequent operation of the on–off mechanism.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of a system, comprising various symbols and notations that convey specific meanings. The key elements are:\n\n* **Arrows**: These arrows represent the flow of variables or signals within the system.\n\t+ One arrow points to the right, indicating the direction of signal propagation.\n\t+ Another arrow points to the left, suggesting an input or initial condition for the system.\n* **Variables and Constants**:\n\t+ The variable \"u\" is represented by a rectangle with its top-left corner pointing to the right.\n\t+ This notation typically indicates that \"u\" is an independent variable or a control input.\n\t+ The constant \"e\" is denoted by a circle with its top-right corner pointing to the left.\n\t+ This notation generally represents an external factor or disturbance affecting the system.\n* **Operator Symbol**: An operator symbol, likely representing addition or integration, is positioned above the arrow pointing to the right.\n\t+ The specific operation being represented depends on the context and additional symbols that might be present.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a system where input \"u\" interacts with an external factor \"e\", resulting in an output affected by the operator symbol. This setup could represent various dynamic systems or processes where inputs are influenced by external factors, leading to outputs that are determined by these interactions. 2–7 (a) Block diagram of an on–off controller; (b) block diagram of an on–off controller with differential gap.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, featuring a differential gap and various components. The diagram is labeled with mathematical symbols and equations.\n\n**Differential Gap:**\n\n*   The differential gap is represented by a rectangular box with an arrow pointing towards it.\n*   The input to the differential gap is denoted as $u$, which represents the error signal.\n*   The output of the differential gap is denoted as $\\Delta u$, which represents the difference between the actual and desired values.\n\n**Components:**\n\n*   **Adder (Summing Junction):**\n    *   Located at the top-left corner of the diagram, the adder is represented by a circle with an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   The input to the adder is denoted as $e$, which represents the error signal.\n    *   The output of the adder is denoted as $u$, which is fed into the differential gap.\n*   **Differential Gap:**\n    *   As mentioned earlier, the differential gap is represented by a rectangular box with an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   The input to the differential gap is denoted as $u$, which represents the error signal.\n    *   The output of the differential gap is denoted as $\\Delta u$, which represents the difference between the actual and desired values.\n*   **Transfer Function (G(s)):**\n    *   Located at the bottom-right corner of the diagram, the transfer function is represented by a rectangle with an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   The input to the transfer function is denoted as $\\Delta u$, which represents the difference between the actual and desired values.\n    *   The output of the transfer function is denoted as $y$, which represents the controlled variable.\n\n**Mathematical Symbols and Equations:**\n\n*   **Differential Gap Equation:**\n    *   $\\Delta u = e$\n*   **Transfer Function Equation:**\n    *   $y = G(s) \\cdot \\Delta u$\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a control system that uses a differential gap to measure the difference between the actual and desired values. The error signal is fed into the adder, which calculates the total input to the differential gap. The output of the differential gap represents the difference between the actual and desired values, which is then passed through the transfer function to produce the controlled variable.\n\n*Answer*: The diagram illustrates a control system that uses a differential gap to measure the difference between the actual and desired values.  \n\nConsider the liquid-level control system shown in Figure 2–8(a),where the electromagnetic valve shown in Figure 2–8(b) is used for controlling the inflow rate.This valve is either open or closed.With this two-position control,the water inflow rate is either a positive constant or zero. As shown in Figure 2–9, the output signal continuously moves between the two limits required to cause the actuating element to move from one fixed position to the other. Notice that the output curve follows one of two exponential curves, one corresponding to the filling curve and the other to the emptying curve. Such output oscillation between two limits is a typical response characteristic of a system under two-position control.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of technical diagrams, each illustrating various aspects of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. The diagrams are arranged in a clockwise pattern from top-left to bottom-right.\n\n**Diagram 1:**\n\n*   **Description:** This diagram depicts a simple electric circuit consisting of a float switch, a capacitor (C), a resistor (R), and a voltage source (V).

The device is labeled \"Movable Iron Core\" and has a magnetic coil attached to it.\n*   **Key Components:**\n    *   Movable iron core\n    *   Magnetic coil\n\nIn summary, the image presents four technical diagrams that illustrate various aspects of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. The diagrams depict electric circuits, mechanical devices with movable iron cores, and graphs showing the relationship between differential gaps and time. 2–8 (a) Liquid-level control system; (b) electromagnetic valve.  \n\n# Figure 2–9  \n\nLevel $h(t)$ -versus $\\cdot t$ curve for the system shown in Figure 2–8(a).  \n\nFrom Figure 2–9, we notice that the amplitude of the output oscillation can be reduced by decreasing the differential gap. The decrease in the differential gap, however, increases the number of on–off switchings per minute and reduces the useful life of the component. The magnitude of the differential gap must be determined from such considerations as the accuracy required and the life of the component.  \n\nProportional Control Action. For a controller with proportional control action, the relationship between the output of the controller $u(t)$ and the actuating error signal $e(t)$ is  \n\n$$\nu(t)\\,=\\,K_{p}e(t)\n$$  \n\nor, in Laplace-transformed quantities,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}}=K_{p}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{p}$ is termed the proportional gain.  \n\nWhatever the actual mechanism may be and whatever the form of the operating power, the proportional controller is essentially an amplifier with an adjustable gain.  \n\nIntegral Control Action. In a controller with integral control action, the value of the controller output $u(t)$ is changed at a rate proportional to the actuating error signal $e(t)$ .That is,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d u(t)}{d t}=K_{i}e(t)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nu(t)\\,=\\,K_{i}\\int_{0}^{t}\\!e(t)\\,d t\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{i}$ is an adjustable constant.The transfer function of the integral controller is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}}={\\frac{K_{i}}{s}}\n$$  \n\nProportional-Plus-Integral Control Action. The control action of a proportionalplus-integral controller is defined by  \n\n$$\nu(t)\\,=\\,K_{p}e(t)\\,+\\frac{K_{p}}{T_{i}}\\int_{0}^{t}\\!e(t)\\,d t\n$$  \n\nor the transfer function of the controller is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}}=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nwhere $T_{i}$ is called the integral time .  \n\nProportional-Plus-Derivative Control Action. The control action of a proportionalplus-derivative controller is defined by  \n\n$$\nu(t)\\,=\\,K_{p}e(t)\\,+\\,K_{p}T_{d}\\frac{d e(t)}{d t}\n$$  \n\nand the transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}=K_{p}(1\\,+\\,T_{d}s)\n$$  \n\nwhere $T_{d}$ is called the derivative time .  \n\nProportional-Plus-Integral-Plus-Derivative Control Action. The combination of proportional control action, integral control action, and derivative control action is termed proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative control action. It has the advantages of each of the three individual control actions. The equation of a controller with this combined action is given by  \n\n$$\nu(t)\\,=\\,K_{p}e(t)\\,+\\frac{K_{p}}{T_{i}}\\int_{0}^{t}e(t)\\,d t\\,+\\,K_{p}T_{d}\\frac{d e(t)}{d t}\n$$  \n\nor the transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{p}$ is the proportional gain, $T_{i}$ is the integral time, and $T_{d}$ is the derivative time. The block diagram of a proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative controller is shown in Figure 2–10.  \n\nThe image depicts a signal flow diagram, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between variables in a system. The diagram shows the flow of signals through a series of blocks, each representing an operation or transformation.\n\n*   The diagram consists of several blocks connected by arrows, which indicate the direction of signal flow.\n*   Each block has an input and output, with the input on the left side and the output on the right side.\n*   The blocks are labeled with symbols or equations that describe the operation performed within each block.\n*   The arrows connecting the blocks represent the flow of signals from one block to another.\n*   The diagram also includes a number of other elements, such as nodes and edges, which help to clarify the relationships between the different blocks.\n\nOverall, the signal flow diagram provides a clear and concise visual representation of the system's behavior, making it easier to understand and analyze its properties. 2–10 Block diagram of a proportional-plusintegral-plusderivative controller.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, with arrows indicating the direction of signal propagation. The diagram is divided into two main sections: \"Disturbance D(s)\" and \"R(s)\", which are connected by an arrow pointing from \"D(s)\" to \"R(s)\". This suggests that the disturbance signal is being fed into a system represented by R(s), which in turn affects the output.\n\n*   **Disturbance D(s)**:\n    *   Located at the top-left corner of the diagram\n    *   Connected to an arrow pointing towards \"R(s)\"\n    *   Indicates the presence of a disturbance or noise signal\n*   **R(s)**:\n    *   Positioned below and to the right of \"Disturbance D(s)\"\n    *   Connected by an arrow from \"D(s)\" and another from \"G1(s)\"\n    *   Represents a system or component that processes the input signal\n*   **G1(s) and G2(s)**:\n    *   Situated below \"R(s)\", with \"G1(s)\" on the left and \"G2(s)\" on the right\n    *   Connected by arrows pointing towards \"H(s)\" and each other, respectively\n    *   Denote additional components or systems that modify the signal flow\n*   **H(s)**:\n    *   Located at the bottom-right corner of the diagram\n    *   Connected by an arrow from both \"G1(s)\" and \"G2(s)\"\n    *   Represents a system or component that further processes the signal\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, including disturbance sources, systems, and processing elements. The arrows indicate the direction of signal propagation, and the labels provide information about the nature of each component. Overall, the diagram suggests a complex system with multiple inputs and outputs, where disturbances affect the output and are processed by different components along the way. 2–11 Closed-loop system subjected to a disturbance.  \n\nClosed-Loop System Subjected to a Disturbance. Figure 2–11 shows a closedloop system subjected to a disturbance. When two inputs (the reference input and disturbance) are present in a linear time-invariant system, each input can be treated independently of the other; and the outputs corresponding to each input alone can be added to give the complete output.The way each input is introduced into the system is shown at the summing point by either a plus or minus sign.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 2–11. In examining the effect of the disturbance $D(s)$ , we may assume that the reference input is zero; we may then calculate the response $C_{D}(s)$ to the disturbance only.This response can be found from  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C_{D}(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{2}(s)}{1\\nonumber+\\,G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nOn the other hand, in considering the response to the reference input $R(s)$ ,we may assume that the disturbance is zero.Then the response $C_{R}(s)$ to the reference input $R(s)$ can be obtained from  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C_{R}(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)}{1+G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nThe response to the simultaneous application of the reference input and disturbance can be obtained by adding the two individual responses. In other words, the response $C(s)$ due to the simultaneous application of the reference input $R(s)$ and disturbance $D(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{C(s)\\,=\\,C_{R}(s)\\,+\\,C_{D}(s)}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{\\,=\\,\\displaystyle{\\frac{G_{2}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)H(s)}}\\,\\bigl[G_{1}(s)R(s)\\,+\\,D(s)\\bigr]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nConsider now the case where $|G_{1}(s)H(s)|\\,\\gg\\,1$ and $|G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)H(s)|\\,\\gg\\,1.$ . In this case, the closed-loop transfer function $C_{D}(s)/D(s)$ becomes almost zero, and the effect of the disturbance is suppressed.This is an advantage of the closed-loop system.  \n\nOn the other hand, the closed-loop transfer function $C_{R}(s)/R(s)$ approaches $1/H(s)$ as the gain of $G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)H(s)$ increases.This means that if $|G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)H(s)|\\,\\gg\\,1$ , then the closed-loop transfer function $C_{R}(s)/R(s)$ becomes independent of $G_{1}(s)$ and $G_{2}(s)$ and inversely proportional to $H(s)$ , so that the variations of $G_{1}(s)$ and $G_{2}(s)$ do not affect the closed-loop transfer function $C_{R}(s)/R(s)$ . This is another advantage of the closed-loop system.It can easily be seen that any closed-loop system with unity feedback, $H(s)=1$ ,tends to equalize the input and output.  \n\nProcedures for Drawing a Block Diagram. To draw a block diagram for a system, first write the equations that describe the dynamic behavior of each component. Then take the Laplace transforms of these equations, assuming zero initial conditions, and represent each Laplace-transformed equation individually in block form. Finally, assemble the elements into a complete block diagram.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{i=\\frac{e_{i}\\,-\\,e_{o}}{R}}\\\\ {~~}\\\\ {e_{o}=\\frac{\\int\\!i\\,d t}{C}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAs an example, consider the $R C$ circuit shown in Figure 2–12(a).The equations for this circuit are  \n\nThe Laplace transforms of Equations (2–4) and (2–5),with zero initial condition,become  \n\nThe image presents a collection of four circuit diagrams, each accompanied by an equation and labeled with letters (a), (b), (c), and (d).

It may serve as educational material for students learning about circuit analysis and design. 2–12 (a) $R C$ circuit; (b) block diagram representing Equation (2–6); (c) block diagram representing Equation (2–7); (d) block diagram of the $R C$ circuit.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c}{\\displaystyle{I(s)=\\frac{E_{i}(s)\\,-\\,E_{o}(s)}{R}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{E_{o}(s)=\\frac{I(s)}{C s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation (2–6) represents a summing operation, and the corresponding diagram is shown in Figure 2–12(b).Equation (2–7) represents the block as shown in Figure 2–12(c). Assembling these two elements, we obtain the overall block diagram for the system as shown in Figure 2–12(d).  \n\nBlock Diagram Reduction. It is important to note that blocks can be connected in series only if the output of one block is not affected by the next following block. If there are any loading effects between the components, it is necessary to combine these components into a single block.  \n\nAny number of cascaded blocks representing nonloading components can be replaced by a single block, the transfer function of which is simply the product of the individual transfer functions.  \n\nA complicated block diagram involving many feedback loops can be simplified by a step-by-step rearrangement. Simplification of the block diagram by rearrangements considerably reduces the labor needed for subsequent mathematical analysis. It should be noted, however, that as the block diagram is simplified, the transfer functions in new blocks become more complex because new poles and new zeros are generated.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 2–1  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 2–13(a). Simplify this diagram.  \n\nBy moving the summing point of the negative feedback loop containing $H_{2}$ outside the positive feedback loop containing $H_{1}$ ,we obtain Figure 2–13(b).Eliminating the positive feedback loop, we have Figure 2–13(c).The elimination of the loop containing $H_{2}/G_{1}$ gives Figure 2–13(d).Finally, eliminating the feedback loop results in Figure 2–13(e).  \n\nThe image presents a collection of five flowcharts, each featuring a distinct set of boxes and arrows. The charts are arranged in two rows, with three charts on top and two at the bottom.\n\n**Flowchart 1: Top Left**\n\n*   This chart consists of four boxes connected by arrows.\n    *   The first box has an arrow pointing to the second box.\n    *   The second box has an arrow pointing to the third box.\n    *   The third box has an arrow pointing to the fourth box.\n    *   The fourth box has no outgoing arrows.\n\n**Flowchart 2: Top Middle**\n\n*   This chart consists of five boxes connected by arrows.\n    *   The first box has an arrow pointing to the second box.\n    *   The second box has an arrow pointing to the third box.\n    *   The third box has an arrow pointing to the fourth box.\n    *   The fourth box has an arrow pointing to the fifth box.\n    *   The fifth box has no outgoing arrows.\n\n**Flowchart 3: Top Right**\n\n*   This chart consists of six boxes connected by arrows.\n    *   The first box has an arrow pointing to the second box.\n    *   The second box has an arrow pointing to the third box.\n    *   The third box has an arrow pointing to the fourth box.\n    *   The fourth box has an arrow pointing to the fifth box.\n    *   The fifth box has an arrow pointing to the sixth box.\n    *   The sixth box has no outgoing arrows.\n\n**Flowchart 4: Bottom Left**\n\n*   This chart consists of three boxes connected by arrows.\n    *   The first box has an arrow pointing to the second box.\n    *   The second box has an arrow pointing to the third box.\n    *   The third box has no outgoing arrows.\n\n**Flowchart 5: Bottom Right**\n\n*   This chart consists of two boxes connected by an arrow.\n    *   The first box has an arrow pointing to the second box.\n    *   The second box has no outgoing arrows.\n\nIn summary, the image features five flowcharts with varying numbers of boxes and arrows. Each chart represents a unique process or system, with arrows indicating the direction of flow between components. 2–13 (a) Multiple-loop system; (b)–(e) successive reductions of the block diagram shown in (a).  \n\nNotice that the numerator of the closed-loop transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ is the product of the transfer functions of the feedforward path.The denominator of $C(s)/R(s)$ is equal to  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathrm{~}}&{=1\\,+\\,\\left(-G_{1}G_{2}H_{1}\\,+\\,G_{2}G_{3}H_{2}\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}G_{3}\\right)}\\\\ {\\mathrm{~}}&{}\\\\ {\\mathrm{~}}&{=1\\,-\\,G_{1}G_{2}H_{1}\\,+\\,G_{2}G_{3}H_{2}\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}G_{3}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n(The positive feedback loop yields a negative term in the denominator.)  \n\n# 2–4 MODELING IN STATE SPACE  \n\nIn this section we shall present introductory material on state-space analysis of control systems.  \n\nModern Control Theory. The modern trend in engineering systems is toward greater complexity, due mainly to the requirements of complex tasks and good accuracy. Complex systems may have multiple inputs and multiple outputs and may be time varying. Because of the necessity of meeting increasingly stringent requirements on the performance of control systems, the increase in system complexity, and easy access to large scale computers, modern control theory, which is a new approach to the analysis and design of complex control systems, has been developed since around 1960.This new approach is based on the concept of state. The concept of state by itself is not new, since it has been in existence for a long time in the field of classical dynamics and other fields.  \n\nModern Control Theory Versus Conventional Control Theory. Modern control theory is contrasted with conventional control theory in that the former is applicable to multiple-input, multiple-output systems, which may be linear or nonlinear, time invariant or time varying, while the latter is applicable only to linear timeinvariant single-input, single-output systems. Also, modern control theory is essentially time-domain approach and frequency domain approach (in certain cases such as H-infinity control), while conventional control theory is a complex frequency-domain approach. Before we proceed further, we must define state, state variables, state vector, and state space.  \n\nState. The state of a dynamic system is the smallest set of variables (called state variables ) such that knowledge of these variables at $t\\,=\\,t_{0}$ ,together with knowledge of the input for $t\\,\\geq t_{0}$ ,completely determines the behavior of the system for any time $t\\geq t_{0}$ .  \n\nNote that the concept of state is by no means limited to physical systems. It is applicable to biological systems, economic systems, social systems, and others.  \n\nState Variables. The state variables of a dynamic system are the variables making up the smallest set of variables that determine the state of the dynamic system. If at least $n$ variables $x_{1}$ ,$x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ are needed to completely describe the behavior of a dynamic system (so that once the input is given for $t\\geq t_{0}$ and the initial state at $t\\,=\\,t_{0}$ is specified, the future state of the system is completely determined), then such n variables are a set of state variables.  \n\nNote that state variables need not be physically measurable or observable quantities. Variables that do not represent physical quantities and those that are neither measurable nor observable can be chosen as state variables. Such freedom in choosing state variables is an advantage of the state-space methods. Practically, however, it is convenient to choose easily measurable quantities for the state variables, if this is possible at all, because optimal control laws will require the feedback of all state variables with suitable weighting.  \n\nState Vector. If $n$ state variables are needed to completely describe the behavior of a given system, then these $n$ state variables can be considered the $n$ components of a vector $\\mathbf{X}$ . Such a vector is called a state vector .A state vector is thus a vector that determines uniquely the system state ${\\bf x}(t)$ for any time $t\\geq t_{0}$ , once the state at $t\\,=\\,t_{0}$ is given and the input $u(t)$ for $t\\geq t_{0}$ is specified.  \n\nState Space. The $n$ -dimensional space whose coordinate axes consist of the $x_{1}$ axis, $x_{2}$ axis, $\\cdots,x_{n}$ axis, where $x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ are state variables, is called a state space .Any state can be represented by a point in the state space.  \n\nState-Space Equations. In state-space analysis we are concerned with three types of variables that are involved in the modeling of dynamic systems: input variables, output variables, and state variables. As we shall see in Section 2–5, the state-space representation for a given system is not unique, except that the number of state variables is the same for any of the different state-space representations of the same system.  \n\nThe dynamic system must involve elements that memorize the values of the input for $t\\geq t_{1}$ . Since integrators in a continuous-time control system serve as memory devices, the outputs of such integrators can be considered as the variables that define the internal state of the dynamic system.Thus the outputs of integrators serve as state variables. The number of state variables to completely define the dynamics of the system is equal to the number of integrators involved in the system.  \n\nAssume that a multiple-input,multiple-output system involves $n$ integrators.Assume also that there are $r$ inputs $u_{1}(t),u_{2}(t),\\ldots,u_{r}(t)$ and $_m$ outputs $y_{1}(t),y_{2}(t),\\ldots,y_{m}(t)$ .Define $n$ outputs of the integrators as state variables: $x_{1}(t),\\,x_{2}(t),\\ldots,\\,x_{n}(t)$ Then the system may be described by  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}(t)\\,=\\,f_{1}\\!\\left(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{r};t\\right)}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}(t)\\,=\\,f_{2}\\!\\left(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{r};t\\right)}\\\\ {\\quad\\qquad\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\qquad\\cdot}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{x}}_{n}(t)\\,=\\,f_{n}\\bigl(x_{1},\\,x_{2},\\,\\ldots,\\,x_{n};\\,u_{1},\\,u_{2},\\,\\ldots,\\,u_{r};\\,t\\bigr)\n$$  \n\nThe outputs $y_{1}(t),y_{2}(t),\\dots,y_{m}(t)$ of the system may be given by  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{l}{y_{1}(t)\\,=\\,g_{1}\\!\\big(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{r};t\\big)}\\\\ {y_{2}(t)\\,=\\,g_{2}\\!\\big(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{r};t\\big)}\\\\ {\\qquad\\cdot}\\\\ {\\qquad\\cdot}\\\\ {\\qquad\\cdot}\\\\ {\\qquad\\cdot}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\n$$\ny_{m}(t)\\,=\\,g_{m}\\bigl(x_{1},\\,x_{2},\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,\\,x_{n};\\,u_{1},\\,u_{2},\\,.\\,.\\,.\\,,\\,u_{r};\\,t\\bigr)\n$$  \n\nIf we define  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathbf{x}(t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}(t)}\\\\ {x_{2}(t)}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {x_{n}(t)}\\end{array}\\right],}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{y_{1}(t)}\\\\ {y_{2}(t)}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {y_{n}(t)}\\end{array}\\right],}\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\sigma}_{\\mathbf{y}}(t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}(t)}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {.}\\\\ {y_{n}(t)}\\end{array}\\right],}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{u},t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{f_{1}(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{l};t)}\\\\ {f_{2}(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{l};t)}\\\\ {\\vdots}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {f_{n}(x_{1},x_{2},\\dots,x_{n};u_{1},u_{2},\\dots,u_{l};t)}\\end{array}\\right],\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(t)\\,=\\,{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{u_{1}(t)}\\\\ {u_{2}(t)}\\\\ {\\quad}\\\\ {\\quad}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {u_{r}(t)}\\end{array}\\right]},\n$$  \n\nthen Equations (2–8) and (2–9) become  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{u},t)}\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{u},t)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Equation (2–10) is the state equation and Equation (2–11) is the output equation. If vector functions fand/or $\\mathbf{g}$ involve time $t$ explicitly, then the system is called a timevarying system.  \n\nIf Equations (2–10) and (2–11) are linearized about the operating state, then we have the following linearized state equation and output equation:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A}(t)\\mathbf{x}(t)\\mathbf{\\delta}+\\mathbf{B}(t)\\mathbf{u}(t)}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\mathbf{C}(t)\\mathbf{x}(t)\\mathbf{\\delta}+\\mathbf{D}(t)\\mathbf{u}(t)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}(t)$ is called the state matrix, ${\\bf\\delta B}(t)$ the input matrix, $\\mathbf{C}(t)$ the output matrix, and $\\mathbf{D}(t)$ the direct transmission matrix.

A block diagram representation of Equations (2–12) and (2–13) is shown in Figure 2–14.  \n\nIf vector functions fand $\\mathbf{g}$ do not involve time $t$ explicitly then the system is called a time-invariant system. In this case, Equations (2–12) and (2–13) can be simplified to  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}(t)\\mathbf{\\Sigma}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}(t)}\\\\ {\\dot{\\mathbf{y}}(t)=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}(t)+\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{u}(t)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation (2–14) is the state equation of the linear, time-invariant system and Equation (2–15) is the output equation for the same system. In this book we shall be concerned mostly with systems described by Equations (2–14) and (2–15).  \n\nIn what follows we shall present an example for deriving a state equation and output equation.  \n\nConsider the mechanical system shown in Figure 2–15. We assume that the system is linear. The external force $u(t)$ is the input to the system, and the displacement $y(t)$ of the mass is the output. The displacement $y(t)$ is measured from the equilibrium position in the absence of the external force.This system is a single-input, single-output system.  \n\nFrom the diagram, the system equation is  \n\n$$\nm{\\ddot{y}}\\,+\\,b{\\dot{y}}\\,+\\,k y\\,=\\,u\n$$  \n\nThis system is of second order.This means that the system involves two integrators. Let us define state variables $x_{1}(t)$ and $x_{2}(t)$ as  \n\nThe image depicts a spring-mass system, which is a common model used to describe the behavior of physical systems. The system consists of two main components: a mass (m) and a spring (k). The mass is represented by a rectangle with an arrow pointing downwards, indicating that it is in motion due to gravity. The spring is represented by a zigzag line connecting the top of the mass to a fixed point above it.\n\nThe spring exerts an upward force on the mass, which counteracts the downward force of gravity and keeps the system in equilibrium. When the system is disturbed from its equilibrium position, the spring will stretch or compress, storing energy in the form of elastic potential energy.\n\nIn addition to the mass and spring, there are two other components present in the image:\n\n*   **Damping device**: A dashed line with an arrow pointing upwards connects the mass to a point below it. This represents a damping device that absorbs some of the energy transferred back into the system.\n*   **Fixed support**: A horizontal line at the top of the image serves as a fixed support for the spring, preventing it from moving vertically.\n\nOverall, this simple yet effective model allows us to analyze and predict the behavior of complex systems, making it an essential tool in many fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{x_{1}(t)\\,=\\,y(t)}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{x_{2}(t)\\,=\\,{\\dot{y}}(t)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen we obtain  \n\nFigure 2–15 Mechanical system.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}_{1}=\\,x_{2}}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}_{2}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{m}\\left(-k y\\,-\\,b\\dot{y}\\right)+\\frac{1}{m}\\,u}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\dot{x}}_{1}\\,=\\,x_{2}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\dot{x}}_{2}\\,=\\,-\\,{\\frac{k}{m}}\\,x_{1}\\,-\\,{\\frac{b}{m}}\\,x_{2}\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{m}}\\,u}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe output equation is  \n\n$$\ny\\,=\\,x_{1}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, with each component represented by a distinct symbol or icon.

The output of these processes is the final result, which can be used in further analysis or applications within the system. 2–16 Block diagram of the mechanical system shown in Figure 2–15.  \n\nIn a vector-matrix form, Equations (2–17) and (2–18) can be written as  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{\\dot{x}_{1}}{\\dot{x}_{2}}}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {\\displaystyle-{\\frac{k}{m}}}&{\\displaystyle-{\\frac{b}{m}}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}}\\right]}+{\\left[\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{m}}}\\end{array}}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\nThe output equation, Equation (2–19), can be written as  \n\n$$\ny\\,=\\,[1\\quad0]{\\sqcap}_{x_{2}}^{}\\]\n$$  \n\nEquation (2–20) is a state equation and Equation (2–21) is an output equation for the system.

In what follows we shall show how to derive the transfer function of a single-input, single-output system from the state-space equations.  \n\nLet us consider the system whose transfer function is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}=G(s)\n$$  \n\nThis system may be represented in state space by the following equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{D}u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}$ is the state vector, $u$ is the input, and $y$ is the output.The Laplace transforms of Equations (2–23) and (2–24) are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{s\\mathbf{X}(s)\\rightharpoonup\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{X}(s)\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}U(s)}\\\\ {Y(s)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{X}(s)\\,+\\,D U(s)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince the transfer function was previously defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output to the Laplace transform of the input when the initial conditions were zero, we set ${\\bf x}(0)$ in Equation (2–25) to be zero.Then we have  \n\n$$\ns\\mathbf{X}(s)\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{X}(s)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{B}U(s)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n(s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{X}(s)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{B}U(s)\n$$  \n\nBy premultiplying $(s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})^{-1}$ to both sides of this last equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}(s)\\,=\\,(s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}U(s)\n$$  \n\nBy substituting Equation (2–27) into Equation (2–26), we get  \n\n$$\nY(s)\\,=\\,\\bigl[\\mathbf{C}(s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\,+\\,D\\bigr]U(s)\n$$  \n\nUpon comparing Equation (2–28) with Equation (2–22), we see that  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,{\\bf C}(s{\\bf I}\\,-\\,{\\bf A})^{-1}{\\bf B}\\,+\\,D\n$$  \n\nThis is the transfer-function expression of the system in terms of $\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C}$ , and $D$ .  \n\nNote that the right-hand side of Equation (2–29) involves $(s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})^{-1}$ .Hence $G(s)$ can be written as  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{Q(s)}{|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q(s)$ is a polynomial in $s$ . Notice that $|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|$ is equal to the characteristic polynomial of $G(s)$ . In other words, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are identical to the poles of $G(s)$ .  \n\n# EXAMPLE 2–3  \n\nConsider again the mechanical system shown in Figure 2–15.

By use of vector-matrix notation, an nth-order differential equation may be expressed by a firstorder vector-matrix differential equation. If $n$ elements of the vector are a set of state variables, then the vector-matrix differential equation is a state equation. In this section we shall present methods for obtaining state-space representations of continuous-time systems.  \n\n# State-Space Representation of nth-Order Systems of Linear Differential Equations in which the Forcing Function Does Not Involve Derivative Terms. Consider the following nth-order system:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{(n)}}\\\\ {{y\\;+}}\\end{array}\\!\\!{}a_{1}y\\;+\\;\\cdots\\,+\\;a_{n-1}\\dot{y}\\;+\\;a_{n}y\\,=\\,u\n$$  \n\nNoting that the knowledge of $y(0),\\dot{y}(0),\\ldots,\\stackrel{(n-1)}{y}(0)$ together with the input $u(t)$ for $t\\,\\geq\\,0$ ,determines completely the future behavior of the system, we may take $y(t),\\dot{y}(t),\\ldots,\\begin{array}{r}{{(n{-}1)}}\\\\ {y}\\end{array}(t)$ as a set of $n$ state variables. (Mathematically, such a choice of state variables is quite convenient.Practically,however,because higher-order derivative terms are inaccurate, due to the noise effects inherent in any practical situations, such a choice of the state variables may not be desirable.)  \n\nLet us define  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{x_{1}=y}}\\\\ {{x_{2}=\\dot{y}}}\\\\ {{\\cdot}}\\\\ {{\\cdot}}\\\\ {{\\cdot}}\\\\ {{x_{n}={\\pmod{2}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (2–30) can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\dot{x}_{1}=\\,x_{2}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}=\\,x_{3}}\\\\ {\\dot{.}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\dot{x}}_{n-1}={x}_{n}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{n}=-a_{n}{x}_{1}-\\cdots-a_{1}{x}_{n}+u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{\\delta}\\mathbf{B}u\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right],\\quad\\quad\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c}{0}&{1}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{1}\\\\ {-a_{n}}&{-a_{n-1}}&{-a_{n-2}}&{\\cdots}&{-a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right],\\quad\\quad\\mathbf{B}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right].\n$$  \n\nThe output can be given by  \n\n$$\ny=[1\\quad0\\quad\\cdots\\quad0]\\left[{\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ny=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}=[1\\;\\;\\;0\\;\\;\\;\\cdots\\;\\;\\;0]\n$$  \n\n[Note that $D$ in Equation (2–24) is zero.] The first-order differential equation, Equation (2–31), is the state equation, and the algebraic equation, Equation (2–32), is the output equation.  \n\nNote that the state-space representation for the transfer function system  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{1}{s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}}}\n$$  \n\nis given also by Equations (2–31) and (2–32).  \n\nState-Space Representation of nth-Order Systems of Linear Differential Equations in which the Forcing Function Involves Derivative Terms.

The state variables must be such that they will eliminate the derivatives of $u$ in the state equation.  \n\nOne way to obtain a state equation and output equation for this case is to define the following $n$ variables as a set of $n$ state variables:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{x_{1}=y\\,-\\,\\beta_{0}u}\\\\ &{x_{2}=\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\beta_{0}\\dot{u}\\,-\\,\\beta_{1}u=\\,\\dot{x}_{1}-\\beta_{1}u}\\\\ &{x_{3}=\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\beta_{0}\\dot{u}\\,-\\,\\beta_{1}\\dot{u}\\,-\\,\\beta_{2}u\\,=\\,\\dot{x}_{2}-\\,\\beta_{2}u}\\\\ &{\\phantom{x_{3}=}.}\\\\ &{\\phantom{x_{3}=}.}\\\\ &{\\phantom{x_{3}=}.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\nx_{n}={\\begin{array}{c}{(n-1)}\\\\ {y}\\end{array}}-\\ \\beta_{0}u\\ -\\ \\beta_{1}u\\ -\\ \\cdots-\\ \\beta_{n-2}{\\dot{u}}\\ -\\ \\beta_{n-1}u\\,=\\,{\\dot{x}}_{n-1}\\,-\\ \\beta_{n-1}u\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta_{0},\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\dots,\\beta_{n-1}$ are determined from  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\beta_{0}=b_{0}}\\\\ &{\\beta_{1}=b_{1}-a_{1}\\beta_{0}}\\\\ &{\\beta_{2}=b_{2}-a_{1}\\beta_{1}-a_{2}\\beta_{0}}\\\\ &{\\beta_{3}=b_{3}-a_{1}\\beta_{2}-a_{2}\\beta_{1}-a_{3}\\beta_{0}}\\\\ &{\\mathrm{~\\\\}.}\\\\ &{\\mathrm{~\\\\\\}.}\\\\ &{\\mathrm{~\\\\\\}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\beta_{n-1}=b_{n-1}-\\,a_{1}\\beta_{n-2}\\,-\\,\\cdots\\,-\\,a_{n-2}\\beta_{1}\\,-\\,a_{n-1}\\beta_{0}\n$$  \n\nWith this choice of state variables the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the state equation is guaranteed.

Methods for obtaining canonical representations of systems in state space (such as controllable canonical form, observable canonical form, diagonal canonical form, and Jordan canonical form) are presented in Chapter 9.  \n\nMATLAB can also be used to obtain state-space representations of systems from transfer-function representations, and vice versa.This subject is presented in Section 2–6.  \n\n# 2–6 TRANSFORMATION OF MATHEMATICAL MODELS WITH MATLAB  \n\nMATLAB is quite useful to transform the system model from transfer function to state space, and vice versa. We shall begin our discussion with transformation from transfer function to state space.  \n\nLet us write the closed-loop transfer function as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{\\mathrm{numerator~polynomial~in~}}{\\mathrm{denominator~polynomial~in~}}}s={\\frac{\\mathrm{num}}{\\mathrm{den}}}\n$$  \n\nOnce we have this transfer-function expression, the MATLAB command  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D}]=\\mathsf{t f}2\\mathsf{s s}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})\n$$  \n\nwill give a state-space representation. It is important to note that the state-space representation for any system is not unique. There are many (infinitely many) state-space representations for the same system.The MATLAB command gives one possible such state-space representation.  \n\nTransformation from Transfer Function to State Space Representation. Consider the transfer-function system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\\frac{s}{(s\\,+\\,10)\\big(s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,16\\big)}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\,\\frac{s}{s^{3}\\,+\\,14s^{2}\\,+\\,56s\\,+\\,160}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThere are many (infinitely many) possible state-space representations for this system. One possible state-space representation is  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\ \\ 0}&{\\ \\ 1}&{\\ \\ 0}\\\\ {\\ \\ 0}&{\\ \\ 0}&{\\ \\ 1}\\\\ {\\ \\ -160}&{\\ -56}&{-14}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\ \\ 0}\\\\ {\\ \\ 1}\\\\ {\\ \\ -14}\\end{array}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=[1\\quad0\\quad0]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+[0]u\n$$  \n\nAnother possible state-space representation (among infinitely many alternatives) is  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{-14}&{-56}&{-160}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=[0\\quad1\\quad0]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\,+\\,[0]u\n$$  \n\nMATLAB transforms the transfer function given by Equation (2–39) into the state-space representation given by Equations (2–40) and (2–41). For the example system considered here, MATLAB Program 2–2 will produce matrices A ,B,C,and $D$ .  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program designed to compute and display the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a given matrix. The program is structured into three main sections:\n\n**Section 1: Matrix Creation**\n\n*   A 3x4 matrix named \"A\" is created, comprising random numerical values.\n\n    <code>\nnum = [1 0; 0 1];\nden = [1 14 56 160];\n\n[A,B,C,D] = tf2ss(num,den)\n</code>\n\n**Section 2: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**\n\n*   The `svd` function is employed to compute the SVD of matrix \"A\".\n*   Three matrices are generated: U, S, and V.\n\n    <code>\nU = svd(A);\nS = svd(A);\nV = svd(A);\n</code>\n\n**Section 3: Displaying Results**\n\n*   The resulting matrices U, S, and V are displayed in a tabular format.\n*   Each matrix is presented with its corresponding singular values.\n\n    <code>\ndisp(U);\ndisp(S);\ndisp(V);\n</code>\n\nThis program effectively computes the SVD of matrix \"A\" and displays the outcome using MATLAB's built-in functions.  \n\nTransformation from State Space Representation to Transfer Function. To obtain the transfer function from state-space equations, use the following command:  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n}]=\\mathsf{s s2t f}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D},\\mathsf{i}\\mathsf{u})\n$$  \n\niu must be specified for systems with more than one input. For example, if the system has three inputs $\\left(u1,u2,u3\\right)$ , then iu must be either 1, 2, or 3, where 1 implies u1, 2 implies $u2$ ,and 3 implies u3 .  \n\nIf the system has only one input, then either  \n\n$$\n[\\mathrm{num},\\mathrm{den}]=\\mathrm{ss}2\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D})\n$$  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n}]=\\mathsf{s s}2\\mathsf{t f}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D},1)\n$$  \n\nmay be used. For the case where the system has multiple inputs and multiple outputs, see Problem A–2–12 .  \n\nEXAMPLE 2–4 Obtain the transfer function of the system defined by the following state-space equations:  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\;0}&{\\;1}&{\\;0}\\\\ {\\;0}&{\\;0}&{\\;1}\\\\ {\\;-5}&{\\!-25}&{\\!-5}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\;0}\\\\ {\\;25}\\\\ {\\;-120}\\end{array}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=[1\\quad0\\quad0]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 2-3 will produce the transfer function for the given system.The transfer function obtained is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\\frac{25s\\,+\\,5}{s^{3}\\,+\\,5s^{2}\\,+\\,25s\\,+\\,5}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 2–3 A = [0   1   0;   0   0   1;   -5   -25   -5]; $\\mathsf{B}=[0;25;-120]\\,,$ ;${\\mathsf{C}}=[1\\quad0\\quad\\ 0]$ ;$\\mathsf{D}=[0]$ ;[num,den] $=$ ss2tf(A,B,C,D) num $=$   \n0   0.0000   25.0000  5.0000 den   \n1.0000   5.0000   25.0000  5.0000 $\\%$ \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* The same result can be obtained by entering the following command: \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* [$\\mathsf{n u m,d e n}]=\\mathsf{s s2t f}(\\mathsf{A,B,C,D},1)$ num $=$   \n0   0.0000   25.0000  5.0000 den $=$   \n1.0000   5.0000   25.0000  5.0000  \n\nNonlinear Systems. A system is nonlinear if the principle of superposition does not apply.Thus, for a nonlinear system the response to two inputs cannot be calculated by treating one input at a time and adding the results.  \n\nAlthough many physical relationships are often represented by linear equations, in most cases actual relationships are not quite linear. In fact, a careful study of physical systems reveals that even so-called “linear systems” are really linear only in limited operating ranges. In practice, many electromechanical systems, hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems, and so on, involve nonlinear relationships among the variables. For example, the output of a component may saturate for large input signals.There may be a dead space that affects small signals. (The dead space of a component is a small range of input variations to which the component is insensitive.) Square-law nonlinearity may occur in some components. For instance, dampers used in physical systems may be linear for low-velocity operations but may become nonlinear at high velocities, and the damping force may become proportional to the square of the operating velocity.  \n\nLinearization of Nonlinear Systems. In control engineering a normal operation of the system may be around an equilibrium point, and the signals may be considered small signals around the equilibrium. (It should be pointed out that there are many exceptions to such a case.) However, if the system operates around an equilibrium point and if the signals involved are small signals, then it is possible to approximate the nonlinear system by a linear system. Such a linear system is equivalent to the nonlinear system considered within a limited operating range. Such a linearized model (linear, time-invariant model) is very important in control engineering.  \n\nThe linearization procedure to be presented in the following is based on the expansion of nonlinear function into a Taylor series about the operating point and the retention of only the linear term. Because we neglect higher-order terms of the Taylor series expansion, these neglected terms must be small enough; that is, the variables deviate only slightly from the operating condition. (Otherwise, the result will be inaccurate.)  \n\nLinear Approximation of Nonlinear Mathematical Models. To obtain a linear mathematical model for a nonlinear system, we assume that the variables deviate only slightly from some operating condition. Consider a system whose input is $x(t)$ and output is $y(t)$ .The relationship between $y(t)$ and $x(t)$ is given by  \n\n$$\ny\\,=\\,f(x)\n$$  \n\nIf the normal operating condition corresponds to $\\overline{{x}},\\,\\overline{{y}}$ ,then Equation (2–42) may be expanded into a Taylor series about this point as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{y\\,=\\,f(x)}}\\\\ {{\\qquad=\\,f(\\bar{x})\\,+\\,\\displaystyle{\\frac{d f}{d x}}\\,(x\\,-\\,\\bar{x})\\,+\\,\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{2!}}\\frac{d^{2}f}{d x^{2}}\\,(x\\,-\\,\\bar{x})^{2}\\,+\\,\\cdots}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the derivatives $d f/d x,d^{2}f/d x^{2},\\ldots$ are evaluated at $x\\,=\\,{\\bar{x}}$ .If the variation $x\\,-\\,\\bar{x}$ is small, we may neglect the higher-order terms in $x\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}.$ .Then Equation (2–43) may be written as  \n\n$$\ny\\,=\\,{\\overline{{y}}}\\,+\\,K(x\\,-\\,{\\overline{{x}}})\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n{\\bar{y}}\\,=\\,f({\\bar{x}})\n$$  \n\n$$\nK={\\frac{d f}{d x}}\\bigg|_{x=\\bar{x}}\n$$  \n\nEquation (2–44) may be rewritten as  \n\n$$\ny\\,-\\,{\\bar{y}}\\,=\\,K(\\,x\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}\\,)\n$$  \n\nwhich indicates that $y\\mathrm{~-~}\\bar{y}$ –is proportional to $x\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}.$ –.Equation (2–45) gives a linear mathematical model for the nonlinear system given by Equation (2–42) near the operating point $x\\,=\\,{\\bar{x}},\\,y\\,=\\,{\\bar{y}}$ –.  \n\nNext, consider a nonlinear system whose output $y$ is a function of two inputs $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ ,so that  \n\n$$\ny\\,=\\,f{\\bigl(}\\,x_{1},\\,x_{2}{\\bigr)}\n$$  \n\nTo obtain a linear approximation to this nonlinear system,we may expand Equation (2–46) into a Taylor series about the normal operating point $\\overline{{x}}_{1},\\,\\overline{{x}}_{2}$ .Then Equation (2–46) becomes  \n\n$$\ny\\,=\\,f{\\bigl(}{\\bar{x}}_{1},{\\bar{x}}_{2}{\\bigr)}\\,+\\,\\left[{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1}}}{\\bigl(}x_{1}\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}_{1}{\\bigr)}\\,+\\,{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{2}}}{\\bigl(}x_{2}\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}_{2}{\\bigr)}\\right]\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle+\\,\\frac{1}{2!}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x_{1}^{2}}\\,(x_{1}\\,-\\,\\bar{x}_{1})^{2}\\,+\\,2\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x_{1}\\partial x_{2}}\\,\\big(x_{1}\\,-\\,\\bar{x}_{1}\\big)(x_{2}\\,-\\,\\bar{x}_{2})\\right.}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\end{+\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x_{2}^{2}}\\,\\big(x_{2}\\,-\\,\\bar{x}_{2})^{2}\\,\\Bigg]+\\cdots}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at $x_{1}={\\bar{x}}_{1}$ ,$x_{2}={\\bar{x}}_{2}$ .Near the normal operating point, the higher-order terms may be neglected.The linear mathematical model of this nonlinear system in the neighborhood of the normal operating condition is then given by  \n\n$$\ny\\,-\\,{\\bar{y}}\\,=\\,K_{1}(x_{1}\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}_{1})\\,+\\,K_{2}(x_{2}\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}_{2})\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\bar{y}\\,=\\,f\\big(\\bar{x}_{1},\\bar{x}_{2}\\big)}}\\\\ {{\\ }}\\\\ {{K_{1}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{1}}\\,\\Bigg\\vert_{x_{1}=\\bar{x}_{1},\\,x_{2}=\\bar{x}_{2}}}}\\\\ {{\\ }}\\\\ {{K_{2}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{2}}\\,\\Bigg\\vert_{x_{1}=\\bar{x}_{1},\\,x_{2}=\\bar{x}_{2}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe linearization technique presented here is valid in the vicinity of the operating condition.If the operating conditions vary widely,however,such linearized equations are not adequate, and nonlinear equations must be dealt with. It is important to remember that a particular mathematical model used in analysis and design may accurately represent the dynamics of an actual system for certain operating conditions, but may not be accurate for other operating conditions.  \n\nEXAMPLE 2–5 Linearize the nonlinear equation  \n\n$$\nz=x y\n$$  \n\nin the region $5\\leq x\\leq7,10\\leq y\\leq12.$ .Find the error if the linearized equation is used to calculate the value of $z$ when $x=5$ ,$y=10$ .  \n\nSince the region considered is given by $5\\leq x\\leq7,10\\leq y\\leq12$ ,choose $\\begin{array}{r}{\\bar{x}\\,=\\,6,\\,\\bar{y}\\,=\\,11.}\\end{array}$ Then $\\Bar{z}\\,=\\,\\Bar{x}\\,\\overline{{y}}\\,=\\,66.$ Let us obtain a linearized equation for the nonlinear equation near a point $\\overline{{x}}\\,=\\,6$ ,$\\bar{y}\\,=\\,11$ .  \n\nExpanding the nonlinear equation into a Taylor series about point $x\\,=\\,{\\bar{x}},y\\,=\\,{\\bar{y}}$ ––and neglecting the higher-order terms, we have  \n\n$$\nz\\mathrm{~-~}\\overline{{z}}\\mathrm{~=~}a\\big(x\\mathrm{~-~}\\overline{{x}}\\big)\\mathrm{~+~}b\\big(y\\mathrm{~-~}\\overline{{y}}\\big)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{a=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial{\\left(x y\\right)}}{\\partial x}\\left|_{x=\\bar{x},\\,y=\\bar{y}}=\\bar{y}\\,=11}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{b=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial{\\left(x y\\right)}}{\\partial y}\\left|_{x=\\bar{x},\\,y=\\bar{y}}=\\bar{x}\\,=6}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence the linearized equation is  \n\n$$\nz\\mathrm{~-~}66\\mathrm{~=~}11\\big(x\\mathrm{~-~}6\\big)\\mathrm{~+~}6\\big(y\\mathrm{~-~}11\\big)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nz\\,=\\,11x\\,+\\,6y\\,-\\,66\n$$  \n\nWhen $x=5,y=10$ ,the value of $z$ given by the linearized equation is  \n\n$$\nz=11x\\,+\\,6y\\,-\\,66=55\\,+\\,60\\,-\\,66=49\n$$  \n\nThe exact value of $z$ is $z=\\,x y=50.$ .The error is thus $50\\,-\\,49\\,=\\,1$ .In terms of percentage, the error is $2\\%$ .  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–2–1.

Obtain the transfer function relating $C(s)$ and $R(s)$ .  \n\nFigure 2–17   \nBlock diagram of a system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the components and their interconnections within a control loop. The diagram shows various blocks representing different elements such as sensors, actuators, controllers, and process models.\n\n*   **Block Diagram:**\n    *   The block diagram consists of several rectangular blocks connected by lines with arrows indicating the direction of signal flow.\n    *   Each block represents a specific component or function within the control system.\n    *   The blocks are labeled with letters such as R(s), H1, G, H2, and C(s) representing different variables and transfer functions in the system.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   There is one input signal labeled R(s) entering the system from the left side of the diagram.\n    *   The system consists of two blocks labeled H1 and H2, which are connected to each other through a common line with an arrow pointing towards G.\n    *   Another block labeled C(s) is placed at the right end of the diagram, indicating the output of the system.\n*   **Connections:**\n    *   The input signal R(s) flows into H1 and then to G.\n    *   The output from G is connected back to itself through a loop with an arrow pointing towards H2.\n    *   Finally, the output from H2 feeds into C(s), which produces the final output of the system.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates the flow of signals within a control system, including inputs, processing blocks (H1 and H2), and outputs. The connections between these components demonstrate how they interact to achieve a desired outcome or behavior in the controlled process.  \n\nFigure 2–18 Simplified block diagrams for the system shown in Figure 2–17.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of three flow diagrams, each featuring a distinct arrangement of boxes and arrows. The top diagram is labeled \"a,\" while the middle one is labeled \"b\" and the bottom one is labeled \"c.\" Each diagram comprises several rectangular boxes with rounded corners connected by arrows.\n\n**Top Diagram (a)**\n\n*   The top diagram features two main sections: the left section contains a single box labeled \"G\" with an arrow pointing to the right, while the right section has three boxes arranged vertically.\n    *   From left to right, the boxes are labeled \"H1/G,\" \"C(s),\" and \"+.\" An arrow points from the top box \"G\" to the middle box \"H1/G.\"\n*   The diagram also includes a smaller box located below the main boxes on the left side of the diagram. This box is connected by an arrow pointing upwards to the rightmost box in the top section.\n*   Additionally, there are several arrows and labels scattered throughout the diagram.\n\n**Middle Diagram (b)**\n\n*   The middle diagram consists of four main boxes arranged horizontally.\n    *   From left to right, these boxes are labeled \"G,\" \"1 + GH2,\" \"+,\" and \"C(s).\" Arrows connect each box in sequence from left to right.\n*   A smaller box is situated below the second box in the horizontal row. This box is connected by an arrow pointing upwards to the third box.\n\n**Bottom Diagram (c)**\n\n*   The bottom diagram features five main boxes arranged horizontally, with additional smaller boxes and arrows present throughout.\n    *   From left to right, these boxes are labeled \"G1,\" \"+,\" \"X(s),\" \"G2,\" and \"C(s).\" Arrows connect each box in sequence from left to right.\n\nIn summary, the image displays three flow diagrams, each consisting of multiple rectangular boxes connected by arrows. The top diagram (a) has two main sections with various arrows and labels, while the middle diagram (b) features four horizontal boxes connected in a linear fashion. The bottom diagram (c) includes five horizontal boxes, with additional smaller boxes and arrows contributing to its overall structure.  \n\nFigure 2–19   \nBlock diagram of a system.  \n\nThe image displays three identical black-and-white diagrams for signal processing, each labeled \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"c\" respectively. The diagrams are arranged vertically with labels at the bottom.\n\nEach diagram consists of a rectangle containing input, processes or operations, and output. Rectangles represent processes or operations that modify inputs to produce outputs; lines connecting these rectangles represent data flow in signal processing. \n\nThe top-left diagram has an input labeled R(s) followed by two G1s connected by a \"+\" symbol, then another G2 with a \"+\" symbol on both sides of it. The output is denoted as C(s). The second diagram contains the same processes and connections but includes an additional G1+1 before the first G1. \n\nThe bottom diagram contains all three G1's in one rectangle labeled \"G1G2G3\". This rectangle has three \"+\" symbols surrounding it, indicating that these operations are executed sequentially.\n\nThese diagrams suggest a signal processing task involving multiple steps or processes to transform input data into output data. They may represent different configurations or variations of the same process, such as filtering, amplification, or modulation operations in digital signal processing. 2–20 Reduction of the block diagram shown in Figure 2–19.   \n(c)  \n\nSolution. The block diagram of Figure 2–19 can be modified to that shown in Figure 2–20(a). Eliminating the minor feedforward path, we obtain Figure 2–20(b), which can be simplified to Figure 2–20(c).The transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ is thus given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=G_{1}G_{2}\\,+\\,G_{2}\\,+\\,1\n$$  \n\nThe same result can also be obtained by proceeding as follows: Since signal $X(s)$ is the sum of two signals $G_{1}R(s)$ and $R(s)$ ,we have  \n\n$$\nX(s)=G_{1}R(s)\\,+\\,R(s)\n$$  \n\nThe output signal $C(s)$ is the sum of $G_{2}X(s)$ and $R(s)$ .Hence  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,G_{2}X(s)\\,+\\,R(s)\\,=\\,G_{2}\\bigl[G_{1}R(s)\\,+\\,R(s)\\bigr]\\,+\\,R(s)\n$$  \n\nAnd so we have the same result as before:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=G_{1}G_{2}\\,+\\,G_{2}\\,+\\,1\n$$  \n\nA–2–3. Simplify the block diagram shown in Figure 2–21. Then obtain the closed-loop transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ .  \n\nFigure 2–21   \nBlock diagram of a system.  \n\nThe image presents a complex system with multiple components, each represented by a box or rectangle. The boxes are interconnected by arrows, indicating the flow of information or signals between them.\n\n**Components and Connections:**\n\n*   **R(s)**: A component at the top left, possibly representing an input signal.\n*   **G1**, **G2**, **G3**, **G4**: Four components in a row, likely representing processing units or modules.\n*   **H1**, **H2**, **H3**: Three components below G1, G2, and G3, possibly representing additional processing steps or branches.\n*   **C(s)**: A component at the bottom right, potentially representing an output signal.\n\n**Arrows and Flow of Information:**\n\n*   Arrows point from R(s) to G1, indicating that the input signal flows into the first processing unit.\n*   Arrows connect each processing unit (G1-G4) in sequence, suggesting a linear flow of information through these components.\n*   Branching arrows emerge from G3 and H2, implying multiple paths or alternatives within the system.\n\n**Symbols and Notations:**\n\n*   The use of symbols (+, -) on the arrows may represent mathematical operations or transformations applied to the input signals as they pass through each component.\n*   The presence of \"G\" and \"H\" prefixes for some components could indicate different types of processing units or functions within the system.\n\n**Overall Structure:**\n\nThe image depicts a hierarchical structure with a clear input-output flow. The top-left corner represents the starting point (R(s)), while the bottom-right corner appears to be the final destination (C(s)). The intermediate components (G1-G4) and their connections suggest a series of processing steps that transform the input signal into the output signal.  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen (O2). The chart is divided into three sections, each representing a different stage in the conversion process.\n\n**Stage 1: CO2 Input and Water Splitting**\n\n*   **CO2 Input**: The first section shows the input of CO2 gas into the system.\n*   **Water Splitting**: The next step involves splitting water molecules (H2O) into hydrogen atoms (H) and oxygen ions (OH-).\n*   **Electrolysis**: The electrolysis process is represented by a series of arrows, indicating the flow of electrons between the electrodes.\n\n**Stage 2: Hydrogen Atom Transfer**\n\n*   **Hydrogen Atom Transfer**: In this stage, the hydrogen atoms are transferred to the CO2 molecule, forming a new compound.\n*   **Oxygen Ion Formation**: The oxygen ions (OH-) are also formed during this process.\n*   **Electron Flow**: The flow of electrons between the electrodes is represented by arrows, indicating the transfer of energy.\n\n**Stage 3: Oxygen Molecule Formation**\n\n*   **Oxygen Molecule Formation**: In the final stage, the oxygen molecules (O2) are formed through the combination of two oxygen ions.\n*   **Electron Flow**: The flow of electrons between the electrodes is again represented by arrows, indicating the transfer of energy.\n\nThe image provides a clear visual representation of the process involved in converting CO2 into O2. By following the arrows and understanding the chemical reactions, it becomes evident how this process works. 2–22 Successive reductions of the block diagram shown in Figure 2–21.  \n\nSolution. First move the branch point between $G_{3}$ and $G_{4}$ to the right-hand side of the loop containing $G_{3},G_{4}$ , and $H_{2}$ .Then move the summing point between $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ to the left-hand side of the first summing point. See Figure 2–22(a). By simplifying each loop, the block diagram can be modified as shown in Figure 2–22(b). Further simplification results in Figure 2–22(c), from which the closed-loop transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ is obtained as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{1}G_{2}G_{3}G_{4}}{1\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}H_{1}\\,+\\,G_{3}G_{4}H_{2}\\,-\\,G_{2}G_{3}H_{3}\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}G_{3}G_{4}H_{1}H_{2}}\n$$  \n\nA–2–4.

The primary objective is to analyze and interpret the structure and relationships depicted in this diagram.\n\n*   **Block Diagram Components**\n    *   **Blocks**: Represented by rectangles, these blocks are labeled with letters (G1, G2, G3) and symbols (+, -, x), indicating different functions or operations.\n    *   **Lines/Arrows**: These connect the blocks, illustrating the flow of signals or inputs between them. Arrows point in the direction of signal flow, while lines indicate connections without specifying direction.\n    *   **Inputs/Outputs**: Blocks may have additional input/output arrows pointing to other blocks or external sources/sinks, representing data flows into and out of each block.\n\n**Step 1: Identify System Components**\n\n*   The diagram consists of several blocks labeled Gf, Gc, H, R(s), E(s), U(s), D(s), C(s).\n    *   These labels are likely functions or transfer functions that process inputs to produce outputs.\n    *   Each block is connected by lines and arrows indicating how signals flow between them.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Signal Flow**\n\n*   By examining the direction of arrows on the lines connecting blocks, we can trace the signal path through the system.\n    *   Signals originating from external sources (e.g., R(s)) enter the system at the top left.\n    *   These signals are processed by subsequent blocks (Gf, Gc), with each block's output serving as input to the next.\n    *   The final processed signal is then fed into another series of blocks (D(s), C(s)), and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret Functionality**\n\n*   Given the absence of explicit labels for these components in the provided text, we must infer their roles based on common control system elements:\n    *   **Gf** and **Gc**: These could represent filters or gain adjustments applied to input signals.\n    *   **H**: This might signify a transformation or processing step within the system.\n    *   **R(s)**: Often represents an external input signal into the system, such as feedback from sensors.\n    *   **E(s)** and **U(s)**: Could denote error signals generated internally by comparing expected outputs with actual ones or control inputs to the plant being controlled.\n    *   **D(s)** and **C(s)**: These might represent compensators or controllers that adjust system behavior based on feedback.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis block diagram illustrates a complex control system, where multiple components work together to process input signals. The exact nature of each component's function cannot be determined without additional context or labels but understanding the flow and interconnections provides insight into how the system operates at a high level. 2–23 Control system with reference input and disturbance input.   \nChapter 2 /Mathematical Modeling of Control Systems  \n\nBy substituting Equation (2–47) into Equation (2–48), we get  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,G_{p}D(s)\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}\\bigl[G_{f}R(s)\\,+\\,G_{c}E(s)\\bigr]\n$$  \n\nBy substituting Equation (2–49) into Equation (2–50), we obtain  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,G_{p}D(s)\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}\\bigl\\{G_{f}R(s)\\,+\\,G_{c}\\bigl[R(s)\\,-\\,H C(s)\\bigr]\\bigr\\}\n$$  \n\nSolving this last equation for $C(s)$ ,we get  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}G_{c}H C(s)\\,=\\,G_{p}D(s)\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}\\bigl(G_{f}\\,+\\,G_{c}\\bigr)R(s)\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,={\\frac{G_{p}D(s)\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}\\bigl(G_{f}\\,+\\,G_{c}\\bigr)R(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}G_{c}H}}\n$$  \n\nNote that Equation (2–51) gives the response $C(s)$ when both reference input $R(s)$ and disturbance input $D(s)$ are present.  \n\nTo find transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ ,we let $D(s)\\,=\\,0$ in Equation (2–51).Then we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{1}G_{p}(G_{f}\\,+\\,G_{c})}{1\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{p}G_{c}H}\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, to obtain transfer function $C(s)/D(s)$ ,we let $R(s)\\,=\\,0$ in Equation (2–51).

The diagram shows various blocks representing different components of the system, along with arrows indicating the flow of signals between them.\n\n*   **Block 1: R1**\n    *   This block represents an input signal to the system.\n    *   It is connected to Block 2 through an arrow, indicating that the output from this block serves as the input for the next stage in the process.\n*   **Block 2: G1**\n    *   This block represents a processing or transformation operation applied to the input signal from R1.\n    *   The result of this operation is fed back into Block 1, indicating that the output of this block is used as an additional input for further processing in the system.\n*   **Block 3: G2**\n    *   Similar to Block 2, this block represents another processing or transformation operation applied to the signal from R1 but after it has passed through Block 1 and been fed back into itself.\n    *   The output of this block is not directly connected to any other blocks, suggesting that its role might be more related to feedback control rather than direct output.\n*   **Block 4: C1**\n    *   This block represents a controller or actuator in the system.\n    *   It receives signals from Block 3 and possibly others not shown, indicating it plays a critical role in adjusting or controlling some aspect of the system based on feedback loops.\n*   **Block 5: R2**\n    *   Another input signal to the system, this block is connected directly to C1, suggesting its output is used for direct control action rather than being processed further within the system.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a closed-loop control system where inputs (R1 and R2) are processed through various blocks (G1, G2, and possibly others not explicitly shown), with outputs feeding back into themselves or directly controlling actuators/controllers. The precise nature of these operations is left to interpretation based on common control system practices but generally involves feedback loops for stabilization and error correction. 2–24 System with two inputs and two outputs.  \n\nSolution.

In Chapter 2 we obtained mathematical models of a simple electrical circuit and a simple mechanical system. In this chapter we consider mathematical modeling of a variety of mechanical systems and electrical systems that may appear in control systems.  \n\nThe fundamental law govering mechanical systems is Newton’s second law. In Section 3–2 we apply this law to various mechanical systems and derive transferfunction models and state-space models.  \n\nThe basic laws governing electrical circuits are Kirchhoff’s laws. In Section 3–3 we obtain transfer-function models and state-space models of various electrical circuits and operational amplifier systems that may appear in many control systems.  \n\n# 3–2 MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS  \n\nThis section first discusses simple spring systems and simple damper systems. Then we derive transfer-function models and state-space models of various mechanical systems.  \n\nThe image presents a spring-mass system, comprising two springs with different stiffness coefficients and a mass connected to them. The system is subjected to an external force F.\n\n**Components of the System**\n\n*   **Springs**\n    *   Two springs are present: k1 and k2.\n    *   Spring k1 has a stiffness coefficient of k1 and is attached to one end of the mass.\n    *   Spring k2 also has a stiffness coefficient of k2 and is connected to the other end of the mass.\n*   **Mass**\n    *   A single mass is depicted in the system, which represents the object being affected by the external force and the springs' restoring forces.\n*   **External Force F**\n    *   An external force labeled as F acts on the system, causing displacement or stretching/compression of the springs and resulting motion of the mass.\n\n**Contextual Information**\n\nThe image does not provide explicit contextual information about the specific application or scenario in which this spring-mass system is being used. However, it appears to be a simplified model for analyzing the behavior of masses under external forces and elastic constraints provided by springs.\n\n**Purpose of the Image**\n\nGiven its simplicity and focus on basic mechanical principles, it is likely intended as an educational tool or example within introductory physics texts or online resources. It serves to illustrate fundamental concepts related to spring-mass systems without delving into complex applications or real-world scenarios. 3–1 (a) System consisting of two springs in parallel; (b) system consisting of two springs in series.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 3–1  \n\nLet us obtain the equivalent spring constants for the systems shown in Figures 3–1(a) and (b), respectively.  \n\nFor the springs in parallel [Figure 3–1(a)] the equivalent spring constant $k_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is obtained from  \n\n$$\nk_{1}x\\,+\\,k_{2}x\\,=\\,F\\,=\\,k_{\\mathrm{eq}}x\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eq}}=k_{1}+k_{2}\n$$  \n\nFor the springs in series [Figure–3–1(b)], the force in each spring is the same.Thus  \n\n$$\nk_{1}y\\,=\\,F,\\qquad k_{2}(x\\,-\\,y)\\,=\\,F\n$$  \n\nElimination of $y$ from these two equations results in  \n\n$$\nk_{2}\\bigg(x\\,-\\frac{F}{k_{1}}\\bigg)\\,=\\,F\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nk_{2}x\\,=\\,F\\,+\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}\\,F\\,=\\frac{k_{1}\\,+\\,k_{2}}{k_{1}}\\,F\n$$  \n\nThe equivalent spring constant $k_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for this case is then found as  \n\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eq}}={\\frac{F}{x}}={\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{1}+k_{2}}}={\\frac{1}{{\\frac{1}{k_{1}}}+{\\frac{1}{k_{2}}}}}\n$$  \n\n# EXAMPLE 3–2  \n\nLet us obtain the equivalent viscous-friction coefficient $b_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ for each of the damper systems shown in Figures 3–2(a) and (b).An oil-filled damper is often called a dashpot.A dashpot is a device that provides viscous friction,or damping.It consists of a piston and oil-filled cylinder.Any relative motion between the piston rod and the cylinder is resisted by the oil because the oil must flow around the piston (or through orifices provided in the piston) from one side of the piston to the other.The dashpot essentially absorbs energy.This absorbed energy is dissipated as heat,and the dashpot does not store any kinetic or potential energy.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram, likely related to electrical or electronic circuits, featuring two distinct sections labeled (a) and (b). The purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the configuration and connections between various components.\n\n*   **Section (a)**\n\n    *   This section comprises three rectangular boxes connected by lines.\n        *   The top box features an arrow pointing to the right at its top-left corner, while another arrow points to the left from the bottom-right corner.\n        *   A line extends from the top of this box, connecting it to a small rectangle with two arrows on either side, positioned below and slightly to the right.\n            *   The left arrow points towards the top, and the right arrow faces downwards.\n    *   Below this configuration, another set of boxes is arranged in a similar manner but with reversed orientations.\n\n*   **Section (b)**\n\n    *   This section displays two rectangular boxes connected by lines as well.\n        *   The first box contains an arrow pointing upwards from its top-right corner and an arrow pointing downwards at the bottom-left corner.\n        *   A line extends from the right of this box, connecting it to a small rectangle with two arrows on either side, positioned below and slightly to the left.\n            *   The left arrow faces upwards, while the right arrow points towards the left.\n    *   Below this configuration, another set of boxes is arranged in a similar manner but with reversed orientations.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates complex configurations involving multiple components connected by lines, arrows indicating directionality and possibly flow or signal transmission. The exact nature of these components (resistors, capacitors, etc.) cannot be determined without additional context or information about the system being represented. 3–2 (a) Two dampers connected in parallel; (b) two dampers connected in series.  \n\n(a) The force $f$ due to the dampers is  \n\n$$\nf=b_{1}\\,(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\\,+\\,b_{2}(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\\,=\\,\\bigl(b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}\\bigr)(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\n$$  \n\nIn terms of the equivalent viscous-friction coefficient $b_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ , force $f$ is given by  \n\n$$\nf\\,=\\,b_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nb_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\,=\\,b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}\n$$  \n\n(b) The force $f$ due to the dampers is  \n\n$$\nf\\,=\\,b_{1}(\\dot{z}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\\,=\\,b_{2}\\,(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{z})\n$$  \n\nwhere $z$ is the displacement of a point between damper $b_{1}$ and damper $b_{2}$ .(Note that the same force is transmitted through the shaft.) From Equation (3–1), we have  \n\n$$\n\\bigl(b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}\\bigr)\\dot{z}\\,=\\,b_{2}\\dot{y}\\,+\\,b_{1}\\dot{x}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\dot{z}\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}}\\left(b_{2}\\dot{y}\\,+\\,b_{1}\\dot{x}\\right)\n$$  \n\nIn terms of the equivalent viscous-friction coefficient $b_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ ,force $f$ is given by  \n\n$$\nf\\,=\\,b_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\big(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x}\\big)\n$$  \n\nBy substituting Equation (3–2) into Equation (3–1), we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{f=b_{2}\\big(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{z}\\big)\\,=\\,b_{2}\\bigg[\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\frac{1}{b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}}\\big(b_{2}\\dot{y}\\,+\\,b_{1}\\dot{x}\\big)\\bigg]}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\frac{b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}}\\,(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus,  \n\n$$\nf\\,=\\,b_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\\,=\\frac{b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}\\,+\\,b_{2}}\\,(\\dot{y}\\,-\\,\\dot{x})\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\nb_{\\mathrm{eq}}={\\frac{b_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}+b_{2}}}={\\frac{1}{{\\frac{1}{b_{1}}}+{\\frac{1}{b_{2}}}}}\n$$  \n\nConsider the spring-mass-dashpot system mounted on a massless cart as shown in Figure 3–3. Let us obtain mathematical models of this system by assuming that the cart is standing still for $t<0$ and the spring-mass-dashpot system on the cart is also standing still for $t<0,$ .In this system, $u(t)$ is the displacement of the cart and is the input to the system. $\\mathrm{At}\\,t\\,=\\,0$ ,the cart is moved at a constant speed, or $\\dot{u}=$ #constant.The displacement $y(t)$ of the mass is the output. (The displacement is relative to the ground.) In this system, $_m$ denotes the mass, $^b$ denotes the viscous-friction coefficient,and $k$ denotes the spring constant.We assume that the friction force of the dashpot is proportional to $\\dot{y}\\mathrm{~-~}\\dot{u}$ and that the spring is a linear spring; that is, the spring force is proportional to $y\\mathrm{~-~}u$ .  \n\nFor translational systems, Newton’s second law states that  \n\n$$\nm a=\\sum F\n$$  \n\nwhere $_m$ is a mass, $a$ is the acceleration of the mass, and $\\Sigma F$ is the sum of the forces acting on the mass in the direction of the acceleration $a$ .Applying Newton’s second law to the present system and noting that the cart is massless, we obtain  \n\n$$\nm\\,{\\frac{d^{2}y}{d t^{2}}}=-b\\biggl({\\frac{d y}{d t}}-{\\frac{d u}{d t}}\\biggr)\\,-\\,k(y\\,-\\,u)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nm\\,{\\frac{d^{2}y}{d t^{2}}}+\\,b\\,{\\frac{d y}{d t}}+\\,k y\\,=\\,b\\,{\\frac{d u}{d t}}+\\,k u\n$$  \n\nThis equation represents a mathematical model of the system considered. Taking the Laplace transform of this last equation, assuming zero initial condition, gives  \n\n$$\n(m s^{2}+b s\\,+\\,k)Y(s)\\,=\\,(b s\\,+\\,k)U(s)\n$$  \n\nTaking the ratio of $Y(s)$ to $U(s)$ , we find the transfer function of the system to be  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Transfer~function}}=G(s)={\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{b s\\,+\\,k}{m s^{2}\\,+\\,b s\\,+\\,k}}\n$$  \n\nSuch a transfer-function representation of a mathematical model is used very frequently in control engineering.  \n\nThe image depicts a massless cart with a spring and damper attached to it, which is being pulled by an external force represented by the arrow labeled \"u\". The cart has a mass denoted as \"m\" and is moving along a horizontal surface. The spring is connected between the cart and the wall, while the damper is connected between the cart and the ground.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Massless Cart:** The cart has no mass, but it does have a spring and damper attached to it.\n*   **Spring:** The spring is connected between the cart and the wall. It provides resistance to the motion of the cart.\n*   **Damper:** The damper is connected between the cart and the ground. It also provides resistance to the motion of the cart, but in a different way than the spring.\n*   **External Force (u):** The external force is represented by the arrow labeled \"u\". It is pulling the cart along the horizontal surface.\n*   **Mass (m):** The mass of the cart is denoted as \"m\".\n*   **Horizontal Surface:** The cart is moving along a horizontal surface.\n\n**Equations:**\n\nThe motion of the cart can be described by the following equations:\n\n*   **Newton's Second Law:** F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the cart, m is its mass, and a is its acceleration.\n*   **Spring Force:** The spring force is given by Hooke's law: F_s = -kx, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position.\n*   **Damper Force:** The damper force is given by Newton's second law for a viscous fluid: F_d = -bv, where b is the damping coefficient and v is the velocity of the cart.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image depicts a massless cart with a spring and damper attached to it. The motion of the cart can be described using Newton's second law and Hooke's law for the spring force.

(Note that state-space representation of the system is not unique.There are infinitely many such representations for this system.)  \n\nBasic laws governing electrical circuits are Kirchhoff’s current law and voltage law. Kirchhoff’s current law (node law) states that the algebraic sum of all currents entering and leaving a node is zero. (This law can also be stated as follows:The sum of currents entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the same node.) Kirchhoff’s voltage law (loop law) states that at any given instant the algebraic sum of the voltages around any loop in an electrical circuit is zero. (This law can also be stated as follows:The sum of the voltage drops is equal to the sum of the voltage rises around a loop.) A mathematical model of an electrical circuit can be obtained by applying one or both of Kirchhoff’s laws to it.  \n\nThis section first deals with simple electrical circuits and then treats mathematical modeling of operational amplifier systems.  \n\nLRC Circuit. Consider the electrical circuit shown in Figure 3–7. The circuit consists of an inductance $L$ (henry), a resistance $R$ (ohm), and a capacitance $C$ (farad). Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the system, we obtain the following equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{{\\cal L}\\displaystyle\\frac{d i}{d t}+\\,R i+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{C}\\int_{}^{}i\\,d t=e_{i}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{C}\\int_{}^{}i\\,d t=e_{o}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFigure 3–7 Electrical circuit.  \n\nThe image depicts a circuit diagram with two key components: an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C).

Each capacitor is linked to one of the resistors.\n\nThe components in the circuit are identified by their respective symbols, with:\n\n*   $R_1$: A resistor situated at the left end of the circuit.\n*   $R_2$: A resistor positioned next to $C_1$ on the right side of the vertical line.\n*   $e_i$: The input voltage source located at the far left of the circuit.\n*   $e_o$: The output voltage source situated at the far right of the circuit.\n*   $i_1$ and $i_2$: Currents flowing through each capacitor.\n\nThis configuration represents a basic electrical circuit, where the input voltage is applied to $R_1$, and the output voltage is taken from $R_2$. The capacitors are integrated into the circuit to modify its behavior. 3–8 Electrical system.  \n\nIt will be shown that the second stage of the circuit ( $R_{2}C_{2}$ portion) produces a loading effect on the first stage ( $[R_{1}C_{1}$ portion).The equations for this system are  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}}\\int(i_{1}\\,-\\,i_{2})\\,d t\\,+\\,R_{1}i_{1}\\,=\\,e_{i}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{C_{1}}\\int(i_{2}-\\,i_{1})\\,d t\\,+\\,R_{2}i_{2}+\\frac{1}{C_{2}}\\int i_{2}\\,d t=0}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{C_{2}}\\int_{}^{}i_{2}\\,d t=e_{o}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTaking the Laplace transforms of Equations (3–27) through (3–29), respectively, using zero initial conditions, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{C_{1}s}[I_{1}(s)\\,-\\,I_{2}(s)]\\,+\\,R_{1}I_{1}(s)\\,=\\,E_{i}(s)}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle\\frac1{C_{1}s}[I_{2}(s)\\,-\\,I_{1}(s)]\\,+\\,R_{2}I_{2}(s)\\,+\\,\\frac1{C_{2}s}\\,I_{2}(s)\\,=\\,0}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle\\frac1{C_{2}s}\\,I_{2}(s)\\,=\\,E_{o}(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEliminating $I_{1}(s)$ from Equations (3–30) and (3–31) and writing $E_{i}(s)$ in terms of $I_{2}(s)$ ,we find the transfer function between $E_{o}(s)$ and $E_{i}(\\mathbf{s})$ to be  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\frac{1}{\\left(R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\right)\\left(R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\right)\\,+\\,R_{1}C_{2}s}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\,=\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}R_{2}C_{2}s^{2}\\,+\\,\\left(R_{1}C_{1}\\,+\\,R_{2}C_{2}\\,+\\,R_{1}C_{2}\\right)s\\,+\\,1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe term $R_{1}C_{2}s$ in the denominator of the transfer function represents the interaction of two simple $R C$ circuits. Since $\\left(R_{1}C_{1}\\,+\\,R_{2}C_{2}\\,+\\,R_{1}C_{2}\\right)^{2}>4\\dot{R_{1}}C_{1}R_{2}C_{2}$ ,the two roots of the denominator of Equation (3–33) are real.  \n\nThe present analysis shows that, if two $R C$ circuits are connected in cascade so that the output from the first circuit is the input to the second, the overall transfer function is not the product of $1/\\big(R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\big)$ and $1/\\big(R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\big)$ .The reason for this is that, when we derive the transfer function for an isolated circuit, we implicitly assume that the output is unloaded. In other words, the load impedance is assumed to be infinite, which means that no power is being withdrawn at the output.When the second circuit is connected to the output of the first, however, a certain amount of power is withdrawn, and thus the assumption of no loading is violated.Therefore, if the transfer function of this system is obtained under the assumption of no loading, then it is not valid. The degree of the loading effect determines the amount of modification of the transfer function.  \n\nComplex Impedances. In deriving transfer functions for electrical circuits, we frequently find it convenient to write the Laplace-transformed equations directly, without writing the differential equations. Consider the system shown in Figure 3–9(a). In this system, $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ represent complex impedances. The complex impedance $Z(s)$ of a two-terminal circuit is the ratio of $E(s)$ , the Laplace transform of the voltage across the terminals, to $I(s)$ ,the Laplace transform of the current through the element, under the assumption that the initial conditions are zero, so that $Z(s)\\,=\\,E(s)/{I(s)}$ .If the two-terminal element is a resistance $R$ , capacitance $C$ , or inductance $L$ , then the complex impedance is given by $R,1/C s$ , or $L s$ , respectively. If complex impedances are connected in series, the total impedance is the sum of the individual complex impedances.  \n\nRemember that the impedance approach is valid only if the initial conditions involved are all zeros. Since the transfer function requires zero initial conditions, the impedance approach can be applied to obtain the transfer function of the electrical circuit. This approach greatly simplifies the derivation of transfer functions of electrical circuits.  \n\nConsider the circuit shown in Figure 3–9(b).Assume that the voltages $e_{i}$ and $e_{o}$ are the input and output of the circuit, respectively. Then the transfer function of this circuit is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}}={\\frac{Z_{2}(s)}{Z_{1}(s)\\,+\\,Z_{2}(s)}}\n$$  \n\nFor the system shown in Figure 3–7,  \n\n$$\nZ_{1}=L s\\,+\\,R,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ Z_{2}={\\frac{1}{C s}}\n$$  \n\nHence the transfer function $E_{o}(s)/E_{i}(s)$ can be found as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{C s}}{L s\\,+\\,R\\,+\\,\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{C s}}=\\frac{1}{L C s^{2}\\,+\\,R C s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nwhich is, of course, identical to Equation (3–26).  \n\nThe image presents a circuit diagram featuring two distinct sections, labeled (a) and (b), each comprising various electrical components. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the configuration and interconnections within these circuits.\n\n*   **Section (a)**\n\n    *   This section consists of three rectangular boxes, denoted as Z1, Z2, and Z3.\n        *   Each box has a corresponding label indicating its impedance value: 10 ohms, 20 ohms, and 30 ohms, respectively.\n    *   The boxes are connected in series by arrows pointing from one box to the next, forming an electrical path.\n*   **Section (b)**\n\n    *   This section includes two rectangular boxes, labeled as Z4 and Z5.\n        *   Their respective impedance values are 40 ohms and 50 ohms.\n    *   The boxes are connected in parallel using lines that intersect at a point between them.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts two separate circuit diagrams, each showcasing different configurations of electrical components. Section (a) illustrates a series connection of three impedances with specific values, while section (b) demonstrates a parallel arrangement of two impedances. These diagrams are likely used for educational or analytical purposes to understand and analyze electrical circuits. 3–9 Electrical circuits.  \n\nConsider again the system shown in Figure 3–8.

The top section of both circuits represents the input signal, while the middle sections feature intricate arrangements of rectangular boxes and arrows. The bottom sections represent the output signals, with small circles indicating additional impedance elements. 3–10 (a) The circuit of Figure 3–8 shown in terms of impedances; (b) equivalent circuit diagram.  \n\nThe image presents a diagram illustrating the concept of signal flow graphs, which are used to represent and analyze complex systems.

The transfer function of a system consisting of two nonloading cascaded elements can be obtained by eliminating the intermediate input and output. For example, consider the system shown in Figure 3–11(a).The transfer functions of the elements are  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)=\\frac{X_{2}(s)}{X_{1}(s)}\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad G_{2}(s)\\,=\\frac{X_{3}(s)}{X_{2}(s)}\n$$  \n\nIf the input impedance of the second element is infinite, the output of the first element is not affected by connecting it to the second element.Then the transfer function of the whole system becomes  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{X_{3}(s)}{X_{1}(s)}=\\frac{X_{2}(s)X_{3}(s)}{X_{1}(s)X_{2}(s)}=G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)~\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function of the whole system is thus the product of the transfer functions of the individual elements.This is shown in Figure 3–11(b).  \n\nAs an example,consider the system shown in Figure 3–12.The insertion of an isolating amplifier between the circuits to obtain nonloading characteristics is frequently used in combining circuits. Since amplifiers have very high input impedances, an isolation amplifier inserted between the two circuits justifies the nonloading assumption.  \n\nThe two simple $R C$ circuits, isolated by an amplifier as shown in Figure 3–12, have negligible loading effects, and the transfer function of the entire circuit equals the product of the individual transfer functions.Thus, in this case,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\bigg(\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1}\\bigg)(K)\\bigg(\\frac{1}{R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1}\\bigg)}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{K}{\\big(R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\big)\\big(R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\big)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nElectronic Controllers. In what follows we shall discuss electronic controllers using operational amplifiers.We begin by deriving the transfer functions of simple operationalamplifier circuits.Then we derive the transfer functions of some of the operational-amplifier controllers.Finally,we give operational-amplifier controllers and their transfer functions in the form of a table.  \n\nThe image depicts a circuit diagram of an isolating amplifier, also known as a differential amplifier. The circuit consists of several components, including resistors (R1 and R2), capacitors (C1 and C2), and an op-amp.\n\n**Components:**\n\n*   **Op-Amp:** The heart of the circuit is the operational amplifier (op-amp), which is represented by a symbol consisting of two parallel lines with a triangle at one end. This represents the input stage of the op-amp.\n*   **Resistors (R1 and R2):** These are connected between the non-inverting input and ground, respectively. They act as voltage dividers to set the reference voltages for the differential input.\n*   **Capacitors (C1 and C2):** These are connected in parallel with the resistors at the input stage of the op-amp. They provide impedance matching and help to suppress noise.\n*   **Input Stage:** The circuit has two inputs, one non-inverting (in phase with the output) and one inverting (180 degrees out of phase). The non-inverting input is connected directly to the reference voltage via R1, while the inverting input is connected to the same reference voltage through C2.\n*   **Output Stage:** The output stage of the op-amp is not shown in detail but would typically consist of a buffer amplifier that provides isolation from the load.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nThe circuit operates as follows:\n\n1.  Signals applied to both inputs are amplified by the op-amp, but because they are on opposite sides of the circuit (differential input), they are subtracted from each other.\n2.  The resulting signal is then amplified by the gain set by R1 and R2.\n3.  The output stage buffers the amplified signal to provide isolation from the load.\n\n**Applications:**\n\nThis type of amplifier finds applications in:\n\n*   **Signal Isolation:** To prevent noise or interference from affecting sensitive circuits.\n*   **Voltage Amplification:** For boosting low-level signals without introducing distortion.\n*   **Low-Noise Applications:** Where minimal noise contribution is required, such as in audio or medical equipment.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a basic differential amplifier circuit with an op-amp core. It's used for signal isolation and amplification, especially in applications where minimizing interference and ensuring high-quality signals is crucial. 3–12 Electrical system.  \n\nThe image depicts a circuit diagram, featuring an operational amplifier (op-amp) with two input terminals and one output terminal. The op-amp is represented by a triangle symbol, while the input terminals are denoted by small circles at the top of the triangle. The output terminal is located at the bottom of the triangle.\n\nThe input terminals are labeled as \"e1\" and \"e2\", indicating that they receive two distinct electrical signals. These signals are likely to be voltage inputs, given the context of an op-amp circuit.\n\nA plus sign (+) is situated between the two input terminals, suggesting a connection or summing point for the input signals. This configuration implies that the op-amp is designed to amplify and process the difference between these two input voltages.\n\nThe output terminal is not labeled with a specific variable, but it is clear that it serves as the final point of interest in this circuit. The absence of any additional components or labels on the output side indicates that its purpose is likely to be the delivery of an amplified or processed signal.\n\nOverall, this circuit diagram appears to represent a basic op-amp configuration, possibly used for amplifying or conditioning analog signals in electronic circuits. 3–13 Operational amplifier.  \n\nOperational Amplifiers. Operational amplifiers, often called op amps, are frequently used to amplify signals in sensor circuits. $\\mathrm{Op}$ amps are also frequently used in filters used for compensation purposes. Figure 3–13 shows an op amp. It is a common practice to choose the ground as 0 volt and measure the input voltages $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ relative to the ground. The input $e_{1}$ to the minus terminal of the amplifier is inverted, and the input $e_{2}$ to the plus terminal is not inverted.The total input to the amplifier thus becomes $\\boldsymbol{e}_{2}\\mathrm{~-~}\\boldsymbol{e}_{1}$ .Hence, for the circuit shown in Figure 3–13, we have  \n\n$$\ne_{o}=K(e_{2}\\,-\\,e_{1})=-K(e_{1}\\,-\\,e_{2})\n$$  \n\nwhere the inputs $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ may be dc or ac signals and $K$ is the differential gain (voltage gain).The magnitude of $K$ is approximately $10^{5}\\sim10^{6}$ for dc signals and ac signals with frequencies less than approximately $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ . (The differential gain $K$ decreases with the signal frequency and becomes about unity for frequencies of $\\begin{array}{r}{1~\\mathrm{MHz}\\sim50~\\mathrm{MHz}.}\\end{array}$ )Note that the op amp amplifies the difference in voltages $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ .Such an amplifier is commonly called a differential amplifier. Since the gain of the op amp is very high, it is necessary to have a negative feedback from the output to the input to make the amplifier stable. (The feedback is made from the output to the inverted input so that the feedback is a negative feedback.)  \n\nIn the ideal op amp, no current flows into the input terminals, and the output voltage is not affected by the load connected to the output terminal. In other words, the input impedance is infinity and the output impedance is zero. In an actual op amp, a very small (almost negligible) current flows into an input terminal and the output cannot be loaded too much. In our analysis here, we make the assumption that the op amps are ideal.  \n\nInverting Amplifier. Consider the operational-amplifier circuit shown in Figure 3–14. Let us obtain the output voltage $e_{o}$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a simple electronic circuit with two resistors and one capacitor. The circuit is represented by a schematic diagram, which uses symbols to represent the components and their connections.\n\n*   **Resistors:**\n    *   There are two resistors in the circuit.\n    *   One resistor is connected between the positive terminal of the power source and the non-inverting input (Vin+) of an operational amplifier (op-amp).\n    *   The other resistor is connected between the negative terminal of the power source and the inverting input (Vin-) of the op-amp.\n*   **Capacitor:**\n    *   There is one capacitor in the circuit.\n    *   It is connected between the output of the op-amp and ground.\n*   **Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp):**\n    *   The op-amp is represented by a symbol with two inputs (Vin+ and Vin-) and an output.\n    *   The op-amp is used to amplify the voltage difference between the two input signals.\n\nThe circuit appears to be a simple voltage follower, where the output voltage follows the input voltage. However, without additional information about the values of the resistors and the capacitor, it is difficult to determine the exact behavior of the circuit. 3–14 Inverting amplifier.   \nChapter 3 /Mathematical Modeling of Mechanical Systems and Electrical Systems  \n\nThe equation for this circuit can be obtained as follows: Define  \n\n$$\ni_{1}={\\frac{e_{i}-e^{\\prime}}{R_{1}}},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ i_{2}={\\frac{e^{\\prime}-e_{o}}{R_{2}}}\n$$  \n\nSince only a negligible current flows into the amplifier, the current $i_{1}$ must be equal to current $i_{2}$ .Thus  \n\n$$\n\\frac{e_{i}\\,-\\,e^{\\prime}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{e^{\\prime}\\,-\\,e_{o}}{R_{2}}\n$$  \n\nSince $K(0\\,-\\,e^{\\prime})\\,=\\,e_{0}$ and $K\\!\\gg\\!1,e^{\\prime}$ must be almost zero, or $e^{\\prime}\\doteq0$ .Hence we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{e_{i}}{R_{1}}=\\frac{-e_{o}}{R_{2}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{e}_{o}=-\\,\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\\,\\boldsymbol{e}_{i}\n$$  \n\nThus the circuit shown is an inverting amplifier. If $R_{1}=R_{2}$ ,then the op-amp circuit shown acts as a sign inverter.  \n\nNoninverting Amplifier. Figure 3–15(a) shows a noninverting amplifier.A circuit equivalent to this one is shown in Figure 3–15(b). For the circuit of Figure 3–15(b), we have  \n\n$$\ne_{o}=K\\bigg(e_{i}-\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}\\,e_{o}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nwhere $K$ is the differential gain of the amplifier. From this last equation, we get  \n\n$$\ne_{i}=\\Bigg(\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}+\\frac{1}{K}\\Bigg)e_{o}\n$$  \n\nSince $K\\gg1$ if $R_{1}/{\\left(R_{1}\\,+\\,R_{2}\\right)}\\gg1/K$ ,then  \n\n$$\ne_{o}=\\bigg(1+\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\\bigg)e_{i}\n$$  \n\nThis equation gives the output voltage $e_{o}$ .Since $e_{o}$ and $e_{i}$ have the same signs,the op-amp circuit shown in Figure 3–15(a) is noninverting.  \n\nThe image shows two circuit diagrams of different electronic devices. The top diagram depicts an operational amplifier (op-amp) used as a differential amplifier, while the bottom diagram illustrates an op-amp configured as an integrator.\n\n**Top Diagram: Differential Amplifier**\n\n*   This configuration is commonly found in audio equipment and other applications where it's necessary to amplify small signals.\n*   The op-amp has two inputs (non-inverting and inverting) and one output, with R1 connected between the non-inverting input and ground, and R2 connected between the inverting input and ground.\n\n**Bottom Diagram: Integrator**\n\n*   This circuit is used to integrate or sum up signals over time.\n*   The op-amp has a single input (inverting) and one output, with C1 connected across the feedback resistor R2. 3–15 (a) Noninverting operational amplifier; (b) equivalent circuit.   \n(b)  \n\nFigure 3–16 shows an electrical circuit involving an operational amplifier. Obtain the output $e_{o}$ .Let us define  \n\n$$\ni_{1}=\\frac{e_{i}\\,-\\,e^{\\prime}}{R_{1}},\\qquad i_{2}=C\\,\\frac{d(e^{\\prime}\\,-\\,e_{o})}{d t},\\qquad i_{3}=\\frac{e^{\\prime}\\,-\\,e_{o}}{R_{2}}\n$$  \n\nNoting that the current flowing into the amplifier is negligible, we have  \n\n$$\ni_{1}=i_{2}+i_{3}\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\n\\frac{e_{i}\\,-\\,e^{\\prime}}{R_{1}}=C\\,\\frac{d\\bigl(e^{\\prime}\\,-\\,e_{o}\\bigr)}{d t}+\\frac{e^{\\prime}\\,-\\,e_{o}}{R_{2}}\n$$  \n\nSince $e^{\\prime}\\doteq0$ ,we have  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{e_{i}}{R_{1}}}=-C\\,{\\frac{d e_{o}}{d t}}-{\\frac{e_{o}}{R_{2}}}\n$$  \n\nTaking the Laplace transform of this last equation, assuming the zero initial condition, we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{i}(s)}{R_{1}}=-\\,\\frac{R_{2}C s\\,+\\,1}{R_{2}}\\,E_{o}(s)\n$$  \n\nwhich can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=-\\,\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\\frac{1}{R_{2}C s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe op-amp circuit shown in Figure 3–16 is a first-order lag circuit.(Several other circuits involving op amps are shown in Table 3–1 together with their transfer functions. Table 3–1 is given on page 85.)  \n\nThis image depicts a circuit diagram featuring an operational amplifier (op-amp) with two resistors and a capacitor.\n\nThe op-amp is represented by the symbol \"e\" with its input terminal labeled \"i1\" on the left side of the circuit. The output terminal is not visible in this representation but is typically located at the right end of the triangle symbol used to represent an operational amplifier.\n\nTwo resistors are connected between the output and one of the two input terminals, as well as a capacitor, denoted by \"C\", which connects the positive terminal on the left side with the negative terminal on the right side of the circuit. These components collectively form a feedback loop around the operational amplifier.\n\nThis configuration is known as a high-pass filter, designed to allow low-frequency signals to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies. The capacitor acts as a frequency-dependent resistance that decreases in value with increasing signal frequency, thereby favoring lower-frequency signals over higher ones and preventing them from passing through the circuit. 3–16 First-order lag circuit using operational amplifier.  \n\nThe image depicts a circuit diagram, featuring three primary components: two impedances (Z1 and Z2) and an operational amplifier (op-amp). The op-amp is symbolized by the triangle with the plus sign at the top left corner, indicating its non-inverting input. A single resistor connects this input to ground.\n\nThe input signal Ei(s) is applied to the circuit through a resistance R1 connected in series with Z1.

Consider the op-amp circuit shown in Figure 3–17. Similar to the case of electrical circuits we discussed earlier, the impedance approach can be applied to op-amp circuits to obtain their transfer functions. For the circuit shown in Figure 3–17, we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{i}(s)\\,-\\,E^{\\prime}(s)}{Z_{1}}=\\frac{E^{\\prime}(s)\\,-\\,E_{o}(s)}{Z_{2}}\n$$  \n\nSince $E^{\\prime}(s)\\doteq0$ ,we have  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}}=-\\,{\\frac{Z_{2}(s)}{Z_{1}(s)}}\n$$  \n\n# EXAMPLE 3–9  \n\nReferring to the op-amp circuit shown in Figure 3–16, obtain the transfer function $E_{o}(s)/E_{i}(s)$ by   \nuse of the impedance approach. The complex impedances $Z_{1}(s)$ and $Z_{2}(s)$ for this circuit are  \n\n$$\nZ_{1}(s)\\,=\\,R_{1}\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad Z_{2}(s)\\,=\\frac{1}{C s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{R_{2}}}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{2}C s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function $E_{o}(s)/E_{i}(s)$ is, therefore, obtained as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}}=-{\\frac{Z_{2}(s)}{Z_{1}(s)}}=-{\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}}{\\frac{1}{R_{2}C s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nwhich is, of course, the same as that obtained in Example 3-8.  \n\nLead or Lag Networks Using Operational Amplifiers. Figure 3–18(a) shows an electronic circuit using an operational amplifier. The transfer function for this circuit can be obtained as follows: Define the input impedance and feedback impedance as $Z_{1}$ and $Z_{2}$ ,respectively.Then  \n\n$$\nZ_{1}=\\frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1},\\qquad Z_{2}=\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nHence, referring to Equation (3–34), we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=-\\frac{Z_{2}}{Z_{1}}=-\\,\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\\frac{R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1}{R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1}=-\\,\\frac{C_{1}}{C_{2}}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{R_{2}C_{2}}}\n$$  \n\nNotice that the transfer function in Equation (3–35) contains a minus sign.Thus,this circuit is sign inverting. If such a sign inversion is not convenient in the actual application, a sign inverter may be connected to either the input or the output of the circuit of Figure 3–18(a). An example is shown in Figure 3–18(b).The sign inverter has the transfer function of  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E(s)}}=-\\,{\\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}}}\n$$  \n\nThe sign inverter has the gain of $-R_{4}/R_{3}$ .Hence the network shown in Figure 3–18(b) has the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\displaystyle\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\frac{R_{2}R_{4}}{R_{1}R_{3}}\\frac{R_{1}C_{1}s+1}{R_{2}C_{2}s+1}=\\frac{R_{4}C_{1}}{R_{3}C_{2}}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}}}{s+\\frac{1}{R_{2}C_{2}}}}\\\\ &{\\quad=K_{c}\\alpha\\frac{T s+1}{\\alpha T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a detailed circuit diagram, comprising two distinct sections labeled (a) and (b).

The op-amp is represented by the symbol \"A\" and has one input terminal labeled as the non-inverting input (+), while the other input terminal is labeled as the inverting input (-). These inputs are connected to ground through separate paths.\n\n*   **Non-Inverting Input (Positive Input)**\n    *   Connected to a resistor with a value of R1.\n    *   The positive terminal of this resistor is grounded, and the negative terminal is connected to the non-inverting input (+) of the op-amp.\n*   **Inverting Input (Negative Input)**\n    *   Connected to a resistor with a value of R2.\n    *   The positive terminal of this resistor is also grounded, and the negative terminal is connected to the inverting input (-) of the op-amp.\n*   **Capacitor**\n    *   Connected between the output of the op-amp and ground.\n    *   This capacitor has a value denoted as C.\n\nThe circuit configuration suggests that it is implementing an integrator, which is a common application for operational amplifiers. An integrator is used to produce an output signal that is proportional to the integral of the input voltage over time. In this specific case, the non-inverting input (+) of the op-amp is connected directly to ground through R1, making it a reference point for the voltage at its inverting input (-). The resistor R2 and capacitor C form a voltage divider across the input signal, which is then applied to the inverting input (-) of the op-amp. The output of the op-amp is taken from the junction between R2 and C.\n\nThis configuration allows the circuit to act as an integrator because it effectively integrates the input signal over time due to the presence of the capacitor (C). The value of C determines the time constant of the integration, influencing how quickly or slowly the output voltage changes in response to variations in the input voltage. 3–26 Operationalamplifier circuit.  \n\nA–3–6.

Consider the servo system shown in Figure 3–29(a).The motor shown is a servomotor,a dc motor designed specifically to be used in a control system.The operation of this system is as follows:A pair of potentiometers acts as an error-measuring device.They convert the input and output positions into proportional electric signals. The command input signal determines the angular position $r$ of the wiper arm of the input potentiometer.The angular position $r$ is the reference input to the system,and the electric potential of the arm is proportional to the angular position of the arm.The output shaft position determines the angular position $c$ of the wiper arm of the output potentiometer.The difference between the input angular position $r$ and the output angular position $c$ is the error signal $e$ , or  \n\n$$\ne\\,=\\,r\\,-\\,c\n$$  \n\nThe potential difference $e_{r}\\mathrm{~-~}e_{c}=e_{v}$ is the error voltage, where $e_{r}$ is proportional to $r$ and $e_{c}$ is proportional to $c$ ; that is, $e_{r}=K_{0}r$ and $e_{c}=K_{0}c$ ,where $K_{0}$ is a proportionality constant.The error voltage that appears at the potentiometer terminals is amplified by the amplifier whose gain constant is $K_{1}$ .The output voltage of this amplifier is applied to the armature circuit of the dc motor.A fixed voltage is applied to the field winding. If an error exists, the motor develops a torque to rotate the output load in such a way as to reduce the error to zero. For constant field current, the torque developed by the motor is  \n\n$$\nT\\,=\\,K_{2}i_{a}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{2}$ is the motor torque constant and $i_{a}$ is the armature current.  \n\nWhen the armature is rotating, a voltage proportional to the product of the flux and angular velocity is induced in the armature. For a constant flux, the induced voltage $e_{b}$ is directly proportional to the angular velocity $d\\theta/d t$ ,or  \n\n$$\ne_{b}=K_{3}\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}\n$$  \n\nwhere $e_{b}$ is the back emf, $K_{3}$ is the back emf constant of the motor, and $\\theta$ is the angular displacement of the motor shaft.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive diagram illustrating the components and relationships within a system, likely related to control theory or signal processing.

Each component plays a crucial role in processing and transmitting signals to achieve a desired outcome. The use of symbols such as R(s), A(s), T(s), G(s), C(s), and Y(s) indicates that the system is modeled using Laplace transforms, which are commonly used in control theory and signal processing applications. 3–29 (a) Schematic diagram of servo system; (b) block diagram for the system; (c) simplified block diagram.  \n\nObtain the transfer function between the motor shaft angular displacement $\\theta$ and the error voltage $e_{v}$ .Obtain also a block diagram for this system and a simplified block diagram when $L_{a}$ is negligible.  \n\nSolution. The speed of an armature-controlled dc servomotor is controlled by the armature voltage $e_{a}$ .(The armature voltage $e_{a}=K_{1}e_{v}$ is the output of the amplifier.) The differential equation for the armature circuit is  \n\n$$\nL_{a}\\frac{d i_{a}}{d t}+R_{a}i_{a}\\,+\\,e_{b}=\\,e_{a}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nL_{a}\\frac{d i_{a}}{d t}+R_{a}i_{a}+K_{3}\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}=K_{1}e_{v}\n$$  \n\nThe equation for torque equilibrium is  \n\n$$\nJ_{0}\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{d t^{2}}+b_{0}\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}=T=K_{2}i_{a}\n$$  \n\nwhere $J_{0}$ is the inertia of the combination of the motor, load, and gear train referred to the motor shaft and $b_{0}$ is the viscous-friction coefficient of the combination of the motor, load, and gear train referred to the motor shaft.  \n\nBy eliminating $i_{a}$ from Equations (3–46) and (3–47), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Theta(s)}{E_{v}(s)}=\\frac{K_{1}K_{2}}{s(L_{a}s\\,+\\,R_{a})(J_{0}s\\,+\\,b_{0})\\,+\\,K_{2}K_{3}s}\n$$  \n\nWe assume that the gear ratio of the gear train is such that the output shaft rotates $n$ times for each revolution of the motor shaft.Thus,  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,n\\theta(s)\n$$  \n\nThe relationship among $E_{v}(s),R(s)$ ,and $C(s)$ is  \n\n$$\nE_{v}(s)\\,=\\,K_{0}\\big[R(s)\\,-\\,C(s)\\big]\\,=\\,K_{0}{\\cal E}(s)\n$$  \n\nThe block diagram of this system can be constructed from Equations (3–48), (3–49), and (3–50), as shown in Figure 3–29(b).The transfer function in the feedforward path of this system is  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\frac{C(s)}{\\theta(s)}\\frac{\\,\\theta(s)\\,}{{E_{v}}(s)}\\frac{{E_{v}}(s)\\,}{{E(s)}}=\\frac{{K_{0}K_{1}K_{2}n}}{s[\\bigl({L_{a}s\\,+\\,R_{a}}\\bigr)\\bigl({J_{0}s\\,+\\,b_{0}}\\bigr)\\,+\\,{K_{2}K_{3}}]}\n$$  \n\nWhen $L_{a}$ is small, it can be neglected, and the transfer function $G(s)$ in the feedforward path becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{G(s)=\\displaystyle\\frac{K_{0}K_{1}K_{2}n}{s\\big[R_{a}(J_{0}s~+~b_{0})~+~K_{2}K_{3}\\big]}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{K_{0}K_{1}K_{2}n/R_{a}}{J_{0}s^{2}~+~\\Big(b_{0}~+~\\displaystyle\\frac{K_{2}K_{3}}{R_{a}}\\Big)s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe term $\\big[b_{0}\\,+\\,\\big(K_{2}K_{3}/R_{a}\\big)\\big]s$ indicates that the back emf of the motor effectively increases the viscous friction of the system. The inertia $J_{0}$ and viscous friction coefficient $b_{0}\\,+\\,\\dot{\\left(K_{2}K_{3}/R_{a}\\right)}$ are  \n\nreferred to the motor shaft.

The resistors are labeled with their corresponding values: $R_1 = 10 \\Omega$, $R_2 = 20 \\Omega$, and $R_3 = 30 \\Omega$. The wires connecting the resistors have no labels or values assigned to them.\n\nOverall, the circuit diagram provides a clear visual representation of the electrical components and their connections, allowing for easy analysis and understanding of the circuit's behavior.  \n\nFigure 3–30 Damper system.  \n\nB–3–2.

The diagram is divided into several key components:\n\n*   **Block**: A rectangular prism representing the object being studied.\n*   **Frictionless Surface**: Indicated by the absence of visible frictional forces or surfaces, suggesting that the block's motion will be influenced solely by external forces.\n*   **Force Applied to Block**: A force labeled \"F\" is applied perpendicular to the surface at a point near one end of the block. This force is responsible for initiating and sustaining the block's motion.\n*   **Pulley System**: A pulley system is attached to the other end of the block, consisting of two wheels connected by a rope or cable. The pulley system appears to be stationary relative to the surface.\n\n**Key Points from the Diagram:**\n\n*   The diagram illustrates the forces acting on the block, including the applied force (F), the weight of the block (mg), and possibly some other external influences not explicitly shown.\n*   The absence of any visible frictional forces suggests that the system is idealized to exclude such effects for simplicity or clarity in analysis.\n*   The pulley system seems to be static, implying it does not contribute directly to the acceleration of the block but may influence its motion through mechanical advantage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe diagram provides a clear visual representation of the forces involved in the block's motion. To determine the acceleration and velocity of the block accurately, one would typically apply Newton's second law of motion (F = ma), where \"m\" represents the mass of the block, \"a\" is its acceleration, and \"F\" is the net force acting on it. Additionally, understanding the role of the pulley system in this context could involve considering principles related to mechanical advantage or torque if applicable.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is not explicitly stated within the provided text as the question does not request a numerical solution but rather an analysis based on the diagram. Therefore, without additional context or specific values for forces, masses, or lengths within the diagram, it's challenging to provide a precise numerical conclusion. 3–34 Inverted-pendulum system.  \n\nThe image depicts a system of springs and masses, with two masses (m1 and m2) connected by springs (k1 and k2).

In this case, it occurs when the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, and the mass is at rest.\n\n**Restoring Force (F):**\n\nThe restoring force is a fundamental concept in simple harmonic motion. It is a force that acts opposite to the direction of displacement, always trying to return the mass to its equilibrium position. In this diagram, the restoring force is represented by an arrow pointing towards the left, indicating that it opposes any displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   The mass oscillates about its equilibrium position due to the restoring force exerted by the spring.\n*   The frequency of oscillation depends on the properties of the spring and the mass attached to it.\n*   This simple harmonic oscillator is a classic example used to demonstrate the principles of simple harmonic motion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image represents a fundamental concept in physics - simple harmonic motion.

In the engineering field the term pneumatic describes fluid systems that use air or gases and hydraulic applies to those using oil.  \n\nWe first discuss liquid-level systems that are frequently used in process control. Here we introduce the concepts of resistance and capacitance to describe the dynamics of such systems. Then we treat pneumatic systems. Such systems are extensively used in the automation of production machinery and in the field of automatic controllers. For instance, pneumatic circuits that convert the energy of compressed air into mechanical energy enjoy wide usage.Also,various types of pneumatic controllers are widely used in industry.Next, we present hydraulic servo systems.These are widely used in machine tool systems,aircraft control systems, etc. We discuss basic aspects of hydraulic servo systems and hydraulic controllers.Both pneumatic systems and hydraulic systems can be modeled easily by using the concepts of resistance and capacitance. Finally, we treat simple thermal systems. Such systems involve heat transfer from one substance to another. Mathematical models of such systems can be obtained by using thermal resistance and thermal capacitance.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. Section 4–1 has presented introductory material for the chapter. Section 4–2 discusses liquid-level systems. Section 4–3 treats pneumatic systems—in particular, the basic principles of pneumatic controllers. Section 4–4 first discusses hydraulic servo systems and then presents hydraulic controllers. Finally, Section 4–5 analyzes thermal systems and obtains mathematical models of such systems.  \n\nIn analyzing systems involving fluid flow, we find it necessary to divide flow regimes into laminar flow and turbulent flow, according to the magnitude of the Reynolds number. If the Reynolds number is greater than about 3000 to 4000, then the flow is turbulent.The flow is laminar if the Reynolds number is less than about 2000. In the laminar case, fluid flow occurs in streamlines with no turbulence. Systems involving laminar flow may be represented by linear differential equations.  \n\nIndustrial processes often involve flow of liquids through connecting pipes and tanks. The flow in such processes is often turbulent and not laminar. Systems involving turbulent flow often have to be represented by nonlinear differential equations. If the region of operation is limited, however, such nonlinear differential equations can be linearized. We shall discuss such linearized mathematical models of liquid-level systems in this section.Note that the introduction of concepts of resistance and capacitance for such liquidlevel systems enables us to describe their dynamic characteristics in simple forms.  \n\nResistance and Capacitance of Liquid-Level Systems. Consider the flow through a short pipe connecting two tanks. The resistance $R$ for liquid flow in such a pipe or restriction is defined as the change in the level difference (the difference of the liquid levels of the two tanks) necessary to cause a unit change in flow rate; that is,  \n\n$$\nR={\\frac{{\\mathrm{change~in~level~difference}},\\,\\mathrm{m}}{{\\mathrm{change~in~flow~rate}},\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}/{\\mathrm{sec}}}}\n$$  \n\nSince the relationship between the flow rate and level difference differs for the laminar flow and turbulent flow, we shall consider both cases in the following.  \n\nConsider the liquid-level system shown in Figure 4–1(a). In this system the liquid spouts through the load valve in the side of the tank. If the flow through this restriction is laminar, the relationship between the steady-state flow rate and steady-state head at the level of the restriction is given by  \n\n$$\nQ\\,=\\,K H\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating various components of a system, including control valves, capacitance, resistance, and load valves. The diagram is divided into two sections: (a) and (b).\n\n**Section (a)**\n\n*   This section displays a simplified representation of a system with the following components:\n    *   **Control valve**: A valve that regulates the flow of fluid through it.\n        *   Symbol: \n    *   **Capacitance (C)**: The ability of a component to store energy in an electric field.\n        *   Formula: Q = CV\n    *   **Resistance (R)**: The opposition to the flow of current in an electrical circuit or fluid through a pipe.\n        *   Formula: I = V/R\n    *   **Load valve**: A valve that controls the flow of fluid into a system.\n\n**Section (b)**\n\n*   This section provides a graphical representation of the relationship between head and flow rate in a system.\n    *   The graph shows how the head (pressure) changes as the flow rate increases or decreases.\n    *   The curve represents the system's characteristic behavior, with the x-axis representing the flow rate and the y-axis representing the head.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a technical illustration of a system's components and their relationships, including control valves, capacitance, resistance, load valves, and the graphical representation of head vs. flow rate. 4–1 (a) Liquid-level system; (b) headversus-flow-rate curve.  \n\nwhere $Q=$ steady-state liquid flow rate, $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ 'sec  \n\n$K=$ coefficient, $\\mathbf{m}^{2}.$ 'sec $H=$ steady-state head, m  \n\nFor laminar flow, the resistance $R_{l}$ is obtained as  \n\n$$\nR_{l}=\\frac{d H}{d Q}=\\frac{H}{Q}\n$$  \n\nThe laminar-flow resistance is constant and is analogous to the electrical resistance.  \n\nIf the flow through the restriction is turbulent, the steady-state flow rate is given by  \n\n$$\nQ=K{\\sqrt{H}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q=$ steady-state liquid flow rate, $\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{sec}$  \n\n$K=$ coefficient, $\\mathrm{m}^{2.5}/\\mathrm{sec}$ $H=$ steady-state head, m  \n\nThe resistance $R_{t}$ for turbulent flow is obtained from  \n\n$$\nR_{t}=\\frac{d H}{d Q}\n$$  \n\nSince from Equation (4–1) we obtain  \n\n$$\nd Q={\\frac{K}{2{\\sqrt{H}}}}\\,d H\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d H}{d Q}}={\\frac{2{\\sqrt{H}}}{K}}={\\frac{2{\\sqrt{H}}\\,{\\sqrt{H}}}{Q}}={\\frac{2H}{Q}}\n$$  \n\nThus,  \n\n$$\nR_{t}=\\frac{2H}{Q}\n$$  \n\nThe value of the turbulent-flow resistance $R_{t}$ depends on the flow rate and the head.The value of $R_{t}$ , however, may be considered constant if the changes in head and flow rate are small.  \n\nBy use of the turbulent-flow resistance, the relationship between $Q$ and $H$ can be given by  \n\n$$\nQ=\\frac{2H}{R_{t}}\n$$  \n\nSuch linearization is valid, provided that changes in the head and flow rate from their respective steady-state values are small.  \n\nIn many practical cases,the value of the coefficient $K$ in Equation (4–1),which depends on the flow coefficient and the area of restriction, is not known.Then the resistance may be determined by plotting the head-versus-flow-rate curve based on experimental data and measuring the slope of the curve at the operating condition.An example of such a plot is shown in Figure 4–1(b).In the figure,point $P$ is the steady-state operating point.The tangent line to the curve at point $P$ intersects the ordinate at point $\\left({\\bar{0}},-{\\bar{H}}\\right)$ .Thus, the slope of this tangent line is $2\\bar{H}/\\bar{Q}$ .Since the resistance $R_{t}$ at the operating point $P$ is given by $2\\bar{H}/\\bar{Q}$ ,the resistance $R_{t}$ is the slope of the curve at the operating point.  \n\nConsider the operating condition in the neighborhood of point $P$ . Define a small deviation of the head from the steady-state value as $h$ and the corresponding small change of the flow rate as $q$ .Then the slope of the curve at point $P$ can be given by  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Slope~of~curve~at~point~}}P={\\frac{h}{q}}={\\frac{2\\overline{{H}}}{\\overline{{Q}}}}=R_{t}\n$$  \n\nThe linear approximation is based on the fact that the actual curve does not differ much from its tangent line if the operating condition does not vary too much.  \n\nThe capacitance $C$ of a tank is defined to be the change in quantity of stored liquid necessary to cause a unit change in the potential (head). (The potential is the quantity that indicates the energy level of the system.)  \n\n$$\nC={\\frac{{\\mathrm{change}}\\;{\\mathrm{in}}\\;{\\mathrm{liquid}}\\;{\\mathrm{stored}},{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}}{{\\mathrm{change}}\\;{\\mathrm{in}}\\;{\\mathrm{head}},{\\mathrm{m}}}}\n$$  \n\nIt should be noted that the capacity $(\\mathrm{m}^{3})$ and the capacitance $(\\mathbf{m}^{2})$ are different. The capacitance of the tank is equal to its cross-sectional area. If this is constant, the capacitance is constant for any head.  \n\nLiquid-Level Systems. Consider the system shown in Figure 4–1(a). The variables are defined as follows:  \n\n$\\bar{Q}=$ steady-state flow rate (before any change has occurred), $\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{sec}$ $q_{i}=$ small deviation of inflow rate from its steady-state value, $\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ 'sec $q_{o}=$ small deviation of outflow rate from its steady-state value, $\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{sec}$ $\\bar{H}\\,=$ steady-state head (before any change has occurred), m $h=$ small deviation of head from its steady-state value, m  \n\nAs stated previously, a system can be considered linear if the flow is laminar. Even if the flow is turbulent, the system can be linearized if changes in the variables are kept small.Based on the assumption that the system is either linear or linearized,the differential equation of this system can be obtained as follows:Since the inflow minus outflow during the small time interval $d t$ is equal to the additional amount stored in the tank, we see that  \n\n$$\nC\\:d h\\,=\\,\\bigl(q_{i}\\,-\\,q_{o}\\bigr)\\,d t\n$$  \n\nFrom the definition of resistance, the relationship between $q_{o}$ and $h$ is given by  \n\n$$\nq_{o}=\\frac{h}{R}\n$$  \n\nThe differential equation for this system for a constant value of $R$ becomes  \n\n$$\nR C\\,{\\frac{d h}{d t}}+h\\,=\\,R q_{i}\n$$  \n\nNote that $R C$ is the time constant of the system.Taking the Laplace transforms of both sides of Equation (4–2), assuming the zero initial condition, we obtain  \n\n$$\n(R C s\\,+\\,1)H(s)\\,=\\,R Q_{i}(s)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nH(s)\\,=\\,{\\mathcal{L}}[h]\\qquad{\\mathrm{and}}\\qquad Q_{i}(s)\\,=\\,{\\mathcal{L}}[q_{i}]\n$$  \n\nIf $q_{i}$ is considered the input and $h$ the output, the transfer function of the system is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{H(s)}{Q_{i}(s)}}={\\frac{R}{R C s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nIf, however, $q_{o}$ is taken as the output, the input being the same, then the transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{o}(s)}{Q_{i}(s)}=\\frac{1}{R C s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nwhere we have used the relationship  \n\n$$\nQ_{o}(s)={\\frac{1}{R}}\\,H(s)\n$$  \n\nLiquid-Level Systems with Interaction. Consider the system shown in Figure 4–2. In this system, the two tanks interact.Thus the transfer function of the system is not the product of two first-order transfer functions.  \n\nIn the following, we shall assume only small variations of the variables from the steady-state values. Using the symbols as defined in Figure 4–2, we can obtain the following equations for this system:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\frac{l_{1}-\\dot{h}_{2}}{R_{1}}=q_{1}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{C_{1}\\frac{d h_{1}}{d t}=q-q_{1}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{\\frac{h_{2}}{R_{2}}=q_{2}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{C_{2}\\frac{d h_{2}}{d t}=q_{1}-q_{2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf $q$ is considered the input and $q_{2}$ the output, the transfer function of the system is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{2}(s)}{Q(s)}=\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}R_{2}C_{2}s^{2}\\,+\\,\\left(R_{1}C_{1}\\,+\\,R_{2}C_{2}\\,+\\,R_{2}C_{1}\\right)s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a diagram of two tanks, Tank 1 and Tank 2, with various components such as pipes, valves, and pumps. The diagram is drawn in black on a white background.\n\n**Tank 1:**\n\n*   Tank 1 has an inlet pipe at the top left corner and an outlet pipe at the bottom right corner.\n*   There is a valve located near the inlet pipe, which appears to be closed.\n*   A pump is connected to the outlet pipe, indicating that it will be used to move water from Tank 1 to another location.\n\n**Tank 2:**\n\n*   Tank 2 has an inlet pipe at the top right corner and an outlet pipe at the bottom left corner.\n*   There is a valve located near the inlet pipe, which appears to be open.\n*   A pump is connected to the outlet pipe, indicating that it will be used to move water from Tank 2 to another location.\n\n**Connections between Tanks:**\n\n*   There are two pipes connecting Tank 1 and Tank 2: one at the top center and one at the bottom center.\n*   The top-center pipe appears to be closed, while the bottom-center pipe is open.\n\n**Other Components:**\n\n*   A valve is located near the outlet pipe of Tank 1, which appears to be open.\n*   A pump is connected to the inlet pipe of Tank 2, indicating that it will be used to move water into Tank 2.\n\nIn summary, the diagram shows two tanks with various components such as pipes, valves, and pumps. The connections between the tanks are also shown, along with other components like pumps and valves. Overall, the diagram provides a detailed representation of the system's layout and functionality.  \n$\\bar{Q}$ :Steady-state flow rate $\\dot{\\overline{{H}}}_{1}$ :Steady-state liquid level of tank 1 $\\overline{{H}}_{2}$ :Steady-state liquid level of tank 2  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive diagram of control systems, comprising five distinct sections labeled (a) to (e). Each section is meticulously designed using black lines and text against a white background.\n\n**Section (a)**\n\n*   This section illustrates a system with two inputs and two outputs.\n    *   The first input, denoted as Q(s), is connected to a block containing the expression 1/C1s, where C1 represents a constant value.\n    *   The second input, represented by H2(s), is linked to a block featuring the equation 1/R1, with R1 signifying another constant value.\n    *   Both outputs, Q1(s) and Q2(s), are connected to blocks containing the expressions 1/1R1s+1 and 1/(C1R1)s+1, respectively.\n\n**Section (b)**\n\n*   This section depicts a system with three inputs and four outputs.\n    *   The first input, denoted as Q(s), is linked to a block featuring the expression 1/C1s.\n    *   The second input, represented by H2(s), is connected to a block containing the equation 1/R1.\n    *   The third input, denoted as Q1(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/(C1R1)s+1.\n    *   All outputs are linked to blocks containing identical expressions: 1/C2s, 1/R2, 1/1R2s+1, and 1/(C2R2)s+1.\n\n**Section (c)**\n\n*   This section illustrates a system with three inputs and five outputs.\n    *   The first input, denoted as Q(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/C1s.\n    *   The second input, represented by H2(s), is linked to a block containing the equation 1/R1.\n    *   The third input, denoted as Q1(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/(C1R1)s+1.\n    *   All outputs are linked to blocks containing identical expressions: 1/C2s, 1/R2, 1/1R2s+1, 1/(C2R2)s+1, and 1/(C3R3)s+1.\n\n**Section (d)**\n\n*   This section displays a system with four inputs and six outputs.\n    *   The first input, denoted as Q(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/C1s.\n    *   The second input, represented by H2(s), is linked to a block containing the equation 1/R1.\n    *   The third input, denoted as Q1(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/(C1R1)s+1.\n    *   The fourth input, denoted as Q3(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/(C2R2)s+1.\n    *   All outputs are linked to blocks containing identical expressions: 1/C2s, 1/R2, 1/1R2s+1, 1/(C2R2)s+1, 1/(C3R3)s+1, and 1/(C4R4)s+1.\n\n**Section (e)**\n\n*   This section presents a system with two inputs and three outputs.\n    *   The first input, denoted as Q(s), is connected to a block featuring the expression 1/C1s.\n    *   The second input, represented by H2(s), is linked to a block containing the equation 1/R1.\n    *   All outputs are linked to blocks containing identical expressions: 1/(C1R1)s+1, 1/(C2R2)s+1, and 1/(C3R3)s+1.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a series of control systems with varying numbers of inputs and outputs. Each section presents a unique configuration of blocks, each representing a specific mathematical operation or function. The use of identical expressions in multiple sections suggests that these diagrams may be related to a larger system or model. 4–3 (a) Elements of the block diagram of the system shown in Figure 4–2; (b) block diagram of the system; (c)–(e) successive reductions of the block diagram.  \n\nIt is instructive to obtain Equation (4–7), the transfer function of the interacted system, by block diagram reduction. From Equations (4–3) through (4–6), we obtain the elements of the block diagram, as shown in Figure 4–3(a). By connecting signals properly, we can construct a block diagram, as shown in Figure 4–3(b). This block diagram can be simplified, as shown in Figure 4–3(c). Further simplifications result in Figures 4–3(d) and (e). Figure 4–3(e) is equivalent to Equation (4–7).  \n\nNotice the similarity and difference between the transfer function given by Equation (4–7) and that given by Equation (3–33).The term $R_{2}C_{1}s$ that appears in the denominator of Equation (4–7) exemplifies the interaction between the two tanks. Similarly, the term $R_{1}C_{2}s$ in the denominator of Equation (3–33) represents the interaction between the two $R C$ circuits shown in Figure 3–8.  \n\n# 4–3 PNEUMATIC SYSTEMS  \n\nIn industrial applications pneumatic systems and hydraulic systems are frequently compared.Therefore, before we discuss pneumatic systems in detail, we shall give a brief comparison of these two kinds of systems.  \n\nComparison Between Pneumatic Systems and Hydraulic Systems. The fluid generally found in pneumatic systems is air; in hydraulic systems it is oil. And it is primarily the different properties of the fluids involved that characterize the differences between the two systems.These differences can be listed as follows:  \n\n1. Air and gases are compressible,whereas oil is incompressible (except at high pressure).   \n2. Air lacks lubricating property and always contains water vapor. Oil functions as a hydraulic fluid as well as a lubricator.   \n3. The normal operating pressure of pneumatic systems is very much lower than that of hydraulic systems.   \n4. Output powers of pneumatic systems are considerably less than those of hydraulic systems.   \n5. Accuracy of pneumatic actuators is poor at low velocities, whereas accuracy of hydraulic actuators may be made satisfactory at all velocities.   \n6. In pneumatic systems, external leakage is permissible to a certain extent, but internal leakage must be avoided because the effective pressure difference is rather small. In hydraulic systems internal leakage is permissible to a certain extent, but external leakage must be avoided.   \n7. No return pipes are required in pneumatic systems when air is used, whereas they are always needed in hydraulic systems.   \n8. Normal operating temperature for pneumatic systems is $5^{\\circ}$ to $60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($41^{\\circ}$ to $140^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F}$ ). The pneumatic system, however, can be operated in the $0^{\\circ}$ to $200^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($32^{\\circ}$ to $392^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F},$ range. Pneumatic systems are insensitive to temperature changes, in contrast to hydraulic systems, in which fluid friction due to viscosity depends greatly on temperature. Normal operating temperature for hydraulic systems is $20^{\\circ}$ to $70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($68^{\\circ}$ to $158^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F}$ ).   \n9. Pneumatic systems are fire- and explosion-proof, whereas hydraulic systems are not, unless nonflammable liquid is used.   \nIn what follows we begin with a mathematical modeling of pneumatic systems.Then  \n\nWe shall first give detailed discussions of the principle by which proportional controllers operate.Then we shall treat methods for obtaining derivative and integral control actions. Throughout the discussions, we shall place emphasis on the fundamental principles, rather than on the details of the operation of the actual mechanisms.  \n\nPneumatic Systems. The past decades have seen a great development in lowpressure pneumatic controllers for industrial control systems, and today they are used extensively in industrial processes. Reasons for their broad appeal include an explosionproof character, simplicity, and ease of maintenance.  \n\nResistance and Capacitance of Pressure Systems. Many industrial processes and pneumatic controllers involve the flow of a gas or air through connected pipelines and pressure vessels.  \n\nConsider the pressure system shown in Figure 4–4(a). The gas flow through the restriction is a function of the gas pressure difference $p_{i}\\mathrm{~-~}p_{o}$ . Such a pressure system may be characterized in terms of a resistance and a capacitance.  \n\nThe gas flow resistance $R$ may be defined as follows:  \n\n$$\nR={\\frac{\\mathrm{change\\in\\gas\\pressure\\difference,lb_{f}/f t^{2}}}{\\mathrm{change\\in\\gas\\flow\\rate,lb/sec}}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nR=\\frac{d(\\Delta P)}{d q}\n$$  \n\nwhere $d(\\Delta P)$ is a small change in the gas pressure difference and $d q$ is a small change in the gas flow rate. Computation of the value of the gas flow resistance $R$ may be quite time consuming. Experimentally, however, it can be easily determined from a plot of the pressure difference versus flow rate by calculating the slope of the curve at a given operating condition, as shown in Figure 4–4(b).  \n\nThe capacitance of the pressure vessel may be defined by  \n\n$$\nC=\\frac{\\mathrm{change\\;in\\;gas\\;stored,lb}}{\\mathrm{change\\;in\\;gas\\;pressure,lb_{f}/f t^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nC={\\frac{d m}{d p}}=V\\,{\\frac{d\\rho}{d p}}\n$$  \n\nFigure 4–4 (a) Schematic diagram of a pressure system; (b) pressuredifference-versusflow-rate curve.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram featuring two distinct sections, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to be related to fluid dynamics or thermodynamics. The diagram is composed of various symbols, arrows, and labels that convey specific information about the system being represented.\n\n**Section (a)**\n\n*   **Title**: Resistance\n*   **Components**:\n    *   R: A resistance symbol, likely representing a physical component such as a pipe or valve.\n    *   q: An arrow pointing to the right, indicating flow direction.\n    *   P + p0: A pressure label above an arrow pointing to the left, suggesting a relationship between two pressures (P and p0).\n    *   C: A capacitance symbol, possibly representing a storage component such as a tank or reservoir.\n\n**Section (b)**\n\n*   **Title**: Slope\n*   **Components**:\n    *   d(ΔP): An arrow pointing upwards, indicating an increase in pressure difference (ΔP).\n    *   dq: An arrow pointing to the right, suggesting a relationship between two quantities (d and q).\n    *   0: A zero label at the origin of the graph.\n    *   Slope: The slope of the curve, which appears to be increasing as ΔP increases.\n\n**Additional Elements**\n\n*   A small \"R\" symbol is present in both sections, possibly indicating a relationship between the two components or systems being represented.\n*   The diagram features various labels and annotations, including \"Resistance,\" \"Capacitance,\" \"Slope,\" and \"d(ΔP),\" which provide context for understanding the system's behavior.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a complex system involving resistance, capacitance, and pressure differences, with an emphasis on understanding how these components interact and affect each other. The diagram provides a visual representation of the relationships between these elements, allowing viewers to better comprehend the underlying physics and dynamics at play.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{C=\\mathrm{capacitance,lb.ft^{2}/l b_{f}}}\\\\ &{m=\\mathrm{mass~of~gas~in~vessel,lb}}\\\\ &{p=\\mathrm{gas~pressure,lb_{f}/f t^{2}}}\\\\ &{V=\\mathrm{volume~of~vessel,ft^{3}}}\\\\ &{\\rho=\\mathrm{density,lb/ft^{3}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe capacitance of the pressure system depends on the type of expansion process involved. The capacitance can be calculated by use of the ideal gas law. If the gas expansion process is polytropic and the change of state of the gas is between isothermal and adiabatic, then  \n\n$$\np\\bigg(\\frac{V}{m}\\bigg)^{n}=\\frac{p}{\\rho^{n}}=\\mathrm{constant}=K\n$$  \n\nwhere $n=$ polytropic exponent.  \n\nFor ideal gases,  \n\n$$\np{\\bar{v}}={\\bar{R}}T\\qquad{\\mathrm{or}}\\qquad p v={\\frac{{\\bar{R}}}{M}}T\n$$  \n\nwhere $p=$ absolute pressure, $\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{ft}^{2}$  \n\n$\\bar{v}=$ volume occupied by 1 mole of a gas, $\\mathrm{ft}^{3}/\\mathrm{lb}$ -mole   \n$\\textstyle{\\overline{{R}}}\\,=$ universal gas constant, ft$\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}$ 'lb-mole ${}^{\\circ}\\mathbf{R}$   \n$T=$ absolute temperature, $^{\\circ}\\mathbf{R}$   \n$v=$ specific volume of gas, $\\mathrm{ft}^{3}/\\mathrm{lb}$   \n$M=$ molecular weight of gas per mole, lb 'lb-mole  \n\nThus  \n\n$$\np v\\,=\\frac{p}{\\rho}=\\frac{\\bar{R}}{M}\\,T\\,=\\,R_{\\mathrm{gas}}T\n$$  \n\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{gas}}\\,=\\,\\mathrm{gas}$ constant, ft $\\cdot\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{lb}\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{R}$ .  \n\nThe polytropic exponent $n$ is unity for isothermal expansion.For adiabatic expansion, $n$ is equal to the ratio of specific heats $c_{p}/c_{v}$ ,where $c_{p}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure and $c_{v}$ is the specific heat at constant volume. In many practical cases, the value of $n$ is approximately constant, and thus the capacitance may be considered constant.  \n\nThe value of $d\\rho/d p$ is obtained from Equations (4–10) and (4–11). From Equation (4–10) we have  \n\n$$\nd p\\,=\\,K n\\rho^{n-1}\\,d\\rho\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\rho}{d p}=\\frac{1}{K n\\rho^{n-1}}=\\frac{\\rho^{n}}{p n\\rho^{n-1}}=\\frac{\\rho}{p n}\n$$  \n\nSubstituting Equation (4–11) into this last equation, we get  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d\\rho}{d p}}={\\frac{1}{n R_{\\mathrm{gas}}T}}\n$$  \n\nThe capacitance $C$ is then obtained as  \n\n$$\nC=\\frac{V}{n R_{\\mathrm{gas}}T}\n$$  \n\nThe capacitance of a given vessel is constant if the temperature stays constant. (In many practical cases, the polytropic exponent $n$ is approximately $1.0\\sim1.2$ for gases in uninsulated metal vessels.)  \n\nPressure Systems. Consider the system shown in Figure 4–4(a). If we assume only small deviations in the variables from their respective steady-state values, then this system may be considered linear.  \n\nLet us define  \n\n${\\overline{{P}}}\\,=$ gas pressure in the vessel at steady state (before changes in pressure have occurred), $\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{ft}^{2}$   \n$p_{i}=$ small change in inflow gas pressure, $\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{ft}^{2}$   \n$p_{o}=$ small change in gas pressure in the vessel, $\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{ft}^{2}$   \n$V=$ volume of the vessel, ft 3   \n$m=$ mass of gas in the vessel, lb   \n$q=$ gas flow rate, lb 'sec   \n$\\rho=$ density of gas, lb/ft 3  \n\nFor small values of $p_{i}$ and $p_{o}$ ,the resistance $R$ given by Equation (4–8) becomes constant and may be written as  \n\n$$\nR=\\frac{p_{i}-p_{o}}{q}\n$$  \n\nThe capacitance $C$ is given by Equation (4–9), or  \n\n$$\nC={\\frac{d m}{d p}}\n$$  \n\nSince the pressure change $d p_{o}$ times the capacitance $C$ is equal to the gas added to the vessel during $d t$ seconds, we obtain  \n\n$$\nC\\:d p_{o}=q\\:d t\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nC\\,{\\frac{d p_{o}}{d t}}={\\frac{p_{i}\\,-\\,p_{o}}{R}}\n$$  \n\nwhich can be written as  \n\n$$\nR C\\,{\\frac{d p_{o}}{d t}}+\\,p_{o}=\\,p_{i}\n$$  \n\nIf $p_{i}$ and $p_{o}$ are considered the input and output, respectively, then the transfer function of the system is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{P_{o}(s)}{P_{i}(s)}}={\\frac{1}{R C s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $R C$ has the dimension of time and is the time constant of the system.  \n\nPneumatic Nozzle–Flapper Amplifiers. A schematic diagram of a pneumatic nozzle–flapper amplifier is shown in Figure 4–5(a).The power source for this amplifier is a supply of air at constant pressure. The nozzle–flapper amplifier converts small changes in the position of the flapper into large changes in the back pressure in the nozzle.Thus a large power output can be controlled by the very little power that is needed to position the flapper.  \n\nIn Figure 4–5(a), pressurized air is fed through the orifice, and the air is ejected from the nozzle toward the flapper. Generally, the supply pressure $P_{s}$ for such a controller is 20 psig $(1.4~\\mathrm{kg_{f}}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ gage). The diameter of the orifice is on the order of 0.01 in. $(0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm})$ and that of the nozzle is on the order of 0.016 in. $(0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm})$ ).To ensure proper functioning of the amplifier, the nozzle diameter must be larger than the orifice diameter.  \n\nIn operating this system, the flapper is positioned against the nozzle opening. The nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ is controlled by the nozzle–flapper distance $X$ . As the flapper approaches the nozzle,the opposition to the flow of air through the nozzle increases,with the result that the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ increases. If the nozzle is completely closed by the flapper, the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ becomes equal to the supply pressure $P_{s}$ .If the flapper is moved away from the nozzle, so that the nozzle–flapper distance is wide (on the order of 0.01 in.), then there is practically no restriction to flow, and the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ takes on a minimum value that depends on the nozzle–flapper device. (The lowest possible pressure will be the ambient pressure $P_{a}$ .)  \n\nNote that, because the air jet puts a force against the flapper, it is necessary to make the nozzle diameter as small as possible.  \n\nA typical curve relating the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ to the nozzle–flapper distance $X$ is shown in Figure 4–5(b).The steep and almost linear part of the curve is utilized in the actual operation of the nozzle–flapper amplifier. Because the range of flapper displacements is restricted to a small value, the change in output pressure is also small, unless the curve is very steep.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating the components and operation of an air supply system. The diagram is divided into two sections, with a key provided to explain the various symbols used.\n\n**Diagram Description:**\n\n*   The top section of the diagram depicts the orifice, air supply, input valve, control valve, nozzle, and flapper.\n    *   **Orifice:** A small opening through which air flows from the air supply into the input valve.\n    *   **Air Supply:** The source of compressed air that supplies the system.\n    *   **Input Valve:** Regulates the flow of air from the air supply to the control valve.\n    *   **Control Valve:** Adjusts the pressure of the air supplied to the nozzle.\n    *   **Nozzle:** Focuses the high-pressure air onto a surface, creating a force that can be used for various applications such as painting or cutting.\n    *   **Flapper:** A small metal piece attached to the end of the nozzle that moves back and forth due to the pressure difference between the two sides of the nozzle.\n*   The bottom section of the diagram shows a graph illustrating the relationship between the pressure of the air supplied to the control valve and the resulting force exerted by the flapper.\n\n**Key:**\n\n*   **Pb:** Pressure of air supplied to control valve\n*   **Pa:** Pressure of air exiting nozzle\n*   **Fs:** Force exerted by flapper\n\n**Graph Description:**\n\n*   The graph shows a downward-sloping curve, indicating that as the pressure of the air supplied to the control valve increases, the force exerted by the flapper decreases.\n*   At high pressures (above 1000 psi), the force exerted by the flapper approaches zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe diagram and graph together provide a clear understanding of how an air supply system works. The orifice, input valve, control valve, nozzle, and flapper all play critical roles in regulating the flow of air and generating force. By adjusting the pressure of the air supplied to the control valve, the user can control the amount of force exerted by the flapper. This technology has applications in various industries, including manufacturing, construction, and materials processing.\n\n**Answer:** The diagram illustrates the components and operation of an air supply system, highlighting its use in generating forces for various industrial applications. 4–5 (a) Schematic diagram of a pneumatic nozzle– flapper amplifier; (b) characteristic curve relating nozzle back pressure and nozzle–flapper distance.  \n\nThe nozzle–flapper amplifier converts displacement into a pressure signal. Since industrial process control systems require large output power to operate large pneumatic actuating valves, the power amplification of the nozzle–flapper amplifier is usually insufficient. Consequently, a pneumatic relay is often needed as a power amplifier in connection with the nozzle–flapper amplifier.  \n\nPneumatic Relays. In practice, in a pneumatic controller, a nozzle–flapper amplifier acts as the first-stage amplifier and a pneumatic relay as the secondstage amplifier. The pneumatic relay is capable of handling a large quantity of airflow.  \n\nA schematic diagram of a pneumatic relay is shown in Figure 4–6(a).As the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ increases, the diaphragm valve moves downward. The opening to the atmosphere decreases and the opening to the pneumatic valve increases, thereby increasing the control pressure $P_{c}$ .When the diaphragm valve closes the opening to the atmosphere, the control pressure $P_{c}$ becomes equal to the supply pressure $P_{s}$ .When the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ decreases and the diaphragm valve moves upward and shuts off the air supply, the control pressure $P_{c}$ drops to the ambient pressure $P_{a}$ .The control pressure $P_{c}$ can thus be made to vary from 0 psig to full supply pressure, usually 20 psig.  \n\nThe total movement of the diaphragm valve is very small. In all positions of the valve, except at the position to shut off the air supply, air continues to bleed into the atmosphere, even after the equilibrium condition is attained between the nozzle back pressure and the control pressure. Thus the relay shown in Figure 4–6(a) is called a bleed-type relay.  \n\nThere is another type of relay, the nonbleed type. In this one the air bleed stops when the equilibrium condition is obtained and, therefore, there is no loss of pressurized air at steady-state operation. Note, however, that the nonbleed-type relay must have an atmospheric relief to release the control pressure $P_{c}$ from the pneumatic actuating valve.A schematic diagram of a nonbleed-type relay is shown in Figure 4–6(b).  \n\nIn either type of relay, the air supply is controlled by a valve, which is in turn controlled by the nozzle back pressure.Thus, the nozzle back pressure is converted into the control pressure with power amplification.  \n\nSince the control pressure $P_{c}$ changes almost instantaneously with changes in the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ ,the time constant of the pneumatic relay is negligible compared with the other larger time constants of the pneumatic controller and the plant.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating two distinct pneumatic valve systems, labeled (a) and (b), which are connected to an atmosphere. The diagram is accompanied by labels that provide detailed information about each component.\n\n**Pneumatic Valve System (a)**\n\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Nozzle back pressure \\(P_b\\)\n    *   Air supply \\(P_s\\)\n    *   Atmosphere\n    *   Pneumatic valve\n    *   To atmosphere \\(Pa\\)\n    *   To pneumatic valve \\(P_c\\)\n*   **Description:** The system consists of a nozzle connected to an air supply, with the back pressure \\(P_b\\) represented by a small arrow pointing upwards. A spring is attached to the top of the valve, and an arrow indicates the direction of movement when the valve opens. The pneumatic valve itself has two ports: one connected to the atmosphere through port \"To atmosphere\" (\\(Pa\\)) and another connected to a pneumatic system via port \"To pneumatic valve\" (\\(P_c\\)). An arrow pointing towards the valve represents the air supply \\(P_s\\).\n*   **Functionality:** The diagram suggests that when the valve opens, air from the supply flows through the nozzle into the atmosphere. Conversely, when the valve closes, air is redirected back to the pneumatic system.\n\n**Pneumatic Valve System (b)**\n\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Nozzle back pressure \\(P_b\\)\n    *   Air supply \\(P_s\\)\n    *   Atmosphere\n    *   Pneumatic valve\n    *   To atmosphere \\(Pa\\)\n    *   To pneumatic valve \\(P_c\\)\n*   **Description:** This system also features a nozzle connected to an air supply, with the back pressure \\(P_b\\) represented by a small arrow pointing upwards. A spring is attached to the top of the valve, and an arrow indicates the direction of movement when the valve opens. The pneumatic valve has two ports: one connected to the atmosphere through port \"To atmosphere\" (\\(Pa\\)) and another connected to a pneumatic system via port \"To pneumatic valve\" (\\(P_c\\)). An arrow pointing towards the valve represents the air supply \\(P_s\\).\n*   **Functionality:** Similar to System (a), this setup enables air to flow from the supply into the atmosphere when the valve opens and redirects air back to the pneumatic system when it closes.\n\nIn summary, both diagrams depict simple pneumatic valve systems that control airflow between an air supply and the atmosphere. They consist of a nozzle, spring-actuated valve, and two ports connected to either the atmosphere or a pneumatic system. The valves open and close in response to changes in pressure, allowing for the flow of air into the atmosphere when open and back to the pneumatic system when closed. 4–6 (a) Schematic diagram of a bleed-type relay; (b) schematic diagram of a nonbleed-type relay.  \n\nThe image shows a diagram of an air supply system, consisting of three main components: a nozzle, a pneumatic valve, and a back pressure. The diagram illustrates how these components work together to control the flow of compressed air.\n\n*   **Nozzle**\n    *   Located at the top of the diagram\n    *   Connected to the atmosphere by an arrow labeled \"To atmosphere\"\n    *   Has an arrow pointing towards it from the left, indicating that it is receiving compressed air\n    *   Has a label \"Nozzle back pressure Pb\" above it, suggesting that it is capable of controlling the pressure at which compressed air exits the nozzle\n*   **Pneumatic Valve**\n    *   Located below the nozzle in the center of the diagram\n    *   Connected to both the nozzle and the atmosphere by arrows labeled \"To pneumatic valve\" and \"To atmosphere\", respectively\n    *   Has a label \"Ps\" above it, indicating that it is capable of controlling the pressure at which compressed air enters the pneumatic valve\n*   **Back Pressure**\n    *   Located below the pneumatic valve in the center of the diagram\n    *   Connected to both the nozzle and the atmosphere by arrows labeled \"To back pressure\" and \"To atmosphere\", respectively\n    *   Has a label \"Pb\" above it, indicating that it is capable of controlling the pressure at which compressed air exits the back pressure\n\nIn summary, the image shows a simple yet effective system for controlling the flow of compressed air. The nozzle provides a means of regulating the pressure at which compressed air exits the system, while the pneumatic valve and back pressure work together to control the overall pressure at which compressed air enters and exits the system.  \n\nIt is noted that some pneumatic relays are reverse acting. For example, the relay shown in Figure 4–7 is a reverse-acting relay. Here, as the nozzle back pressure $P_{b}$ increases, the ball valve is forced toward the lower seat, thereby decreasing the control pressure $P_{c}$ .Thus, this relay is a reverse-acting relay.  \n\nPneumatic Proportional Controllers (Force-Distance Type). Two types of pneumatic controllers,one called the force-distance type and the other the force-balance type, are used extensively in industry.Regardless of how differently industrial pneumatic controllers may appear, careful study will show the close similarity in the functions of the pneumatic circuit.Here we shall consider the force-distance type of pneumatic controllers.  \n\nFigure 4–8(a) shows a schematic diagram of such a proportional controller.The nozzle– flapper amplifier constitutes the first-stage amplifier, and the nozzle back pressure is controlled by the nozzle–flapper distance.The relay-type amplifier constitutes the secondstage amplifier.The nozzle back pressure determines the position of the diaphragm valve for the second-stage amplifier, which is capable of handling a large quantity of airflow.  \n\nIn most pneumatic controllers, some type of pneumatic feedback is employed. Feedback of the pneumatic output reduces the amount of actual movement of the flapper. Instead of mounting the flapper on a fixed point, as shown in Figure 4–8(b), it is often pivoted on the feedback bellows, as shown in Figure 4–8(c).The amount of feedback can be regulated by introducing a variable linkage between the feedback bellows and the flapper connecting point.The flapper then becomes a floating link. It can be moved by both the error signal and the feedback signal.  \n\nThe operation of the controller shown in Figure 4–8(a) is as follows. The input signal to the two-stage pneumatic amplifier is the actuating error signal. Increasing the actuating error signal moves the flapper to the left.This move will, in turn, increase the nozzle back pressure, and the diaphragm valve moves downward. This results in an increase of the control pressure. This increase will cause bellows $F$ to expand and move the flapper to the right, thus opening the nozzle. Because of this feedback, the nozzle– flapper displacement is very small, but the change in the control pressure can be large.  \n\nIt should be noted that proper operation of the controller requires that the feedback bellows move the flapper less than that movement caused by the error signal alone. (If these two movements were equal, no control action would result.)  \n\nEquations for this controller can be derived as follows. When the actuating error is zero,or $e\\,=\\,0$ ,an equilibrium state exists with the nozzle–flapper distance equal to $\\bar{X}$ ,the displacement of bellows equal to nozzle back pressure equal to $\\bar{P}_{b}$ –,and the control pressure equal to $\\bar{Y}$ ,the displacement of the diaphragm equal to $\\bar{P}_{c}$ .When an actuating $\\bar{Z}$ ,the error exists,the nozzle–flapper distance,the displacement of the bellows,the displacement of the diaphragm,the nozzle back pressure,and the control pressure deviate from their respective equilibrium values.Let these deviations be $x,y,z,p_{b}$ ,and $p_{c}$ ,respectively.(The positive direction for each displacement variable is indicated by an arrowhead in the diagram.)  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating various types of valves and their components. The diagram is divided into four sections, each labeled with a letter from (a) to (d), and features a combination of lines, arrows, and symbols to represent different parts.\n\n*   **Section (a):**\n    *   This section shows a pneumatic relay valve connected to an orifice, flapper, nozzle, and pneumatic relay.\n    *   The valve has a pressure input on the left side and an output on the right side.\n    *   There are several lines and arrows connecting the different components, indicating the flow of air or gas through the system.\n*   **Section (b):**\n    *   This section depicts an error signal being fed into a feedback loop that controls the position of a flapper valve.\n    *   The error signal is represented by an arrow pointing towards the center of the diagram, where it intersects with another line representing the output of the valve.\n    *   A feedback loop connects back to the input, allowing for continuous monitoring and adjustment of the system.\n*   **Section (c):**\n    *   This section illustrates a pneumatic relay valve connected to an orifice, flapper, nozzle, and pneumatic relay.\n    *   The valve has a pressure input on the left side and an output on the right side.\n    *   There are several lines and arrows connecting the different components, indicating the flow of air or gas through the system.\n*   **Section (d):**\n    *   This section shows a block diagram representing the control system for a pneumatic valve.\n    *   The system consists of an error signal generator, a controller, and a final element (the valve).\n    *   Arrows connect each component to illustrate the flow of information and control signals within the system.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a detailed illustration of various types of valves and their components, as well as their connections and interactions. The diagram helps to clarify how these systems work together to control pressure and flow rates in industrial applications. 4–8 (a) Schematic diagram of a force-distance type of pneumatic proportional controller; (b) flapper mounted on a fixed point; (c) flapper mounted on a feedback bellows; (d) displacement $x$ as a result of addition of two small displacements; (e) block diagram for the controller; (f) simplified block diagram for the controller.  \n\nAssuming that the relationship between the variation in the nozzle back pressure and the variation in the nozzle–flapper distance is linear, we have  \n\n$$\np_{b}=K_{1}x\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{1}$ is a positive constant. For the diaphragm valve,  \n\n$$\np_{b}=K_{2}z\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{2}$ is a positive constant. The position of the diaphragm valve determines the control pressure. If the diaphragm valve is such that the relationship between $p_{c}$ and $z$ is linear, then  \n\n$$\np_{c}=K_{3}z\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{3}$ is a positive constant. From Equations (4–13), (4–14), and (4–15), we obtain  \n\n$$\np_{c}=\\frac{K_{3}}{K_{2}}\\,p_{b}=\\frac{K_{1}K_{3}}{K_{2}}\\,x\\,=\\,K x\n$$  \n\nwhere $K\\,=\\,K_{1}K_{3}/K_{2}$ is a positive constant. For the flapper, since there are two small movements ( $e$ and $y$ ) in opposite directions, we can consider such movements separately and add up the results of two movements into one displacement $x$ . See Figure 4–8(d). Thus, for the flapper movement, we have  \n\n$$\nx=\\frac{b}{a\\,+\\,b}\\,e\\,-\\,\\frac{a}{a\\,+\\,b}\\,y\n$$  \n\nThe bellows acts like a spring, and the following equation holds true:  \n\n$$\nA p_{c}=k_{s}y\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ is the effective area of the bellows and $k_{s}$ is the equivalent spring constant— that is, the stiffness due to the action of the corrugated side of the bellows.  \n\nAssuming that all variations in the variables are within a linear range, we can obtain a block diagram for this system from Equations (4–16), (4–17), and (4–18) as shown in Figure 4–8(e). From Figure 4–8(e), it can be clearly seen that the pneumatic controller shown in Figure 4–8(a) itself is a feedback system.The transfer function between $p_{c}$ and $e$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}}={\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\frac{b}{a\\,+\\,b}}\\,K}{\\displaystyle{1\\,+\\,K\\,{\\frac{a}{a\\,+\\,b}}{\\frac{A}{k_{s}}}}}}=K_{p}\n$$  \n\nA simplified block diagram is shown in Figure 4–8(f). Since $p_{c}$ and $e$ are proportional, the pneumatic controller shown in Figure 4–8(a) is a pneumatic proportional controller .As seen from Equation (4–19), the gain of the pneumatic proportional controller can be widely varied by adjusting the flapper connecting linkage. [The flapper connecting linkage is not shown in Figure 4–8(a).] In most commercial proportional controllers an adjusting knob or other mechanism is provided for varying the gain by adjusting this linkage.  \n\nAs noted earlier, the actuating error signal moved the flapper in one direction, and the feedback bellows moved the flapper in the opposite direction,but to a smaller degree.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram, likely related to fluid dynamics or thermodynamics, featuring various components and labels. The diagram is divided into two sections: (a) and (b).\n\n*   **Section (a)**:\n\n    *   A rectangular box with a curved pipe connected to it.\n    *   Two arrows pointing towards the box from the left side, labeled \"P_s\" and \"P_c\".\n    *   An arrow pointing away from the box on the right side, labeled \"X\".\n    *   A small circle at the top of the diagram, possibly indicating a pressure gauge or sensor.\n*   **Section (b)**:\n\n    *   Two graphs with x-axes ranging from 0 to X and y-axes ranging from 0 to P_a.\n    *   The graph on the left has two curves, one labeled \"P_b\" and the other unlabeled.\n    *   The graph on the right has three curves, one labeled \"P_c\", another labeled \"P_s\", and a third unlabeled.\n\nThe diagram appears to illustrate the relationship between pressure and flow rate in a system involving pipes, valves, and sensors. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to provide further interpretation or explanation of the specific details depicted in the image. 4–9 (a) Pneumatic controller without a feedback mechanism; (b) curves $P_{b}$ versus $X$ and $P_{c}$ versus $X$ .  \n\nThe effect of the feedback bellows is thus to reduce the sensitivity of the controller.The principle of feedback is commonly used to obtain wide proportional-band controllers.  \n\nPneumatic controllers that do not have feedback mechanisms [which means that one end of the flapper is fixed, as shown in Figure 4–9(a)] have high sensitivity and are called pneumatic two-position controllers or pneumatic on–off controllers . In such a controller, only a small motion between the nozzle and the flapper is required to give a complete change from the maximum to the minimum control pressure. The curves relating $P_{b}$ to $X$ and $P_{c}$ to $X$ are shown in Figure 4–9(b). Notice that a small change in $X$ can cause a large change in $P_{b}$ ,which causes the diaphragm valve to be completely open or completely closed.  \n\nPneumatic Proportional Controllers (Force-Balance Type). Figure 4–10 shows a schematic diagram of a force-balance type pneumatic proportional controller. Forcebalance type controllers are in extensive use in industry.Such controllers are called stack controllers.The basic principle of operation does not differ from that of the force-distance type controller.The main advantage of the force-balance type controller is that it eliminates many mechanical linkages and pivot joints,thereby reducing the effects of friction.  \n\nIn what follows, we shall consider the principle of the force-balance type controller. In the controller shown in Figure 4–10, the reference input pressure $P_{r}$ and the output pressure $P_{o}$ are fed to large diaphragm chambers. Note that a force-balance type pneumatic controller operates only on pressure signals.Therefore, it is necessary to convert the reference input and system output to corresponding pressure signals.  \n\nThe image depicts a diagram of a pressure control system, which is used to regulate the output pressure of a system based on input signals. The diagram shows various components and their connections.\n\n*   **Atmosphere**: \n    *   This is the source of reference pressure.\n    *   It provides a constant pressure that is used as a reference for the output pressure.\n*   **Reference Input Pressure**: \n    *   This is the input signal that controls the output pressure.\n    *   It is connected to the atmosphere through a valve or a flow control device.\n*   **Output Pressure**: \n    *   This is the controlled variable in the system.\n    *   The output pressure is measured and compared to the reference pressure.\n    *   If the output pressure is different from the reference pressure, the system takes corrective action to adjust it.\n*   **Control Valve**: \n    *   This valve regulates the flow of fluid into the chamber.\n    *   It is controlled by the difference between the reference pressure and the output pressure.\n    *   When the output pressure is higher than the reference pressure, the control valve opens to reduce the flow of fluid into the chamber.\n*   **Chamber**: \n    *   This is where the fluid accumulates under pressure.\n    *   The pressure in the chamber is measured by a sensor and compared to the reference pressure.\n    *   If the pressure in the chamber is higher than the reference pressure, the control valve opens to reduce the flow of fluid into the chamber.\n*   **Sensor**: \n    *   This measures the pressure in the chamber.\n    *   It sends an electrical signal to the control system based on the measured pressure.\n\nIn summary, the diagram shows a pressure control system that uses a reference input pressure and a sensor to measure the output pressure. The system takes corrective action by adjusting the flow of fluid into the chamber through a control valve when the output pressure is different from the reference pressure. 4–10 Schematic diagram of a force-balance type pneumatic proportional controller.  \n\nAs in the case of the force-distance type controller, this controller employs a flapper, nozzle, and orifices. In Figure 4–10, the drilled opening in the bottom chamber is the nozzle.The diaphragm just above the nozzle acts as a flapper.  \n\nThe operation of the force-balance type controller shown in Figure $4{-}10\\ \\mathrm{may}$ be summarized as follows: 20-psig air from an air supply flows through an orifice, causing a reduced pressure in the bottom chamber. Air in this chamber escapes to the atmosphere through the nozzle. The flow through the nozzle depends on the gap and the pressure drop across it. An increase in the reference input pressure $P_{r}$ ,while the output pressure $P_{o}$ remains the same, causes the valve stem to move down, decreasing the gap between the nozzle and the flapper diaphragm.This causes the control pressure $P_{c}$ to increase. Let  \n\n$$\np_{e}=P_{r}-P_{o}\n$$  \n\nIf the control pressure equal to $\\boldsymbol{p}_{e}=0$ ,there is an equilibrium state with the nozzle–flapper distance equal to $\\bar{P}_{c}$ –.At this equilibrium state, $\\hat{P_{1}}=\\overline{{P}}_{c}k$ k ( where $k<1$ $\\bar{X}$ )and and  \n\n$$\n\\bar{X}\\,=\\,\\alpha\\big(\\bar{P}_{c}A_{1}\\,-\\,\\bar{P}_{c}k A_{1}\\big)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant.  \n\nLet us assume that $p_{e}\\neq0$ and define small variations in the nozzle–flapper distance and control pressure as $x$ and $p_{c}$ , respectively.Then we obtain the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\bar{X}\\,+\\,x\\,=\\,\\alpha\\big[\\big(\\bar{P}_{c}\\,+\\,p_{c}\\big)A_{1}\\,-\\,\\big(\\bar{P}_{c}\\,+\\,p_{c}\\big)k A_{1}\\,-\\,p_{e}\\big(A_{2}\\,-\\,A_{1}\\big)\\big]\n$$  \n\nFrom Equations (4–21) and (4–22), we obtain  \n\n$$\nx\\,=\\,\\alpha\\big[p_{c}(1\\,-\\,k)A_{1}\\,-\\,p_{e}\\big(A_{2}\\,-\\,A_{1}\\big)\\big]\n$$  \n\nAt this point, we must examine the quantity $x$ . In the design of pneumatic controllers, the nozzle–flapper distance is made quite small. In view of the fact that $x/\\alpha$ is very much smaller than $p_{c}(1\\,-\\,k)A_{1}$ or $p_{e}(A_{2}\\,\\,\\dot{-}\\,A_{1}).$ —that is, for $p_{e}\\neq0$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{x}{\\alpha}\\ll\\,p_{c}(1\\,-\\,k)A_{1}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\frac{x}{\\alpha}\\ll\\,p_{e}(A_{2}\\,-\\,A_{1})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwe may neglect the term $x$ in our analysis. Equation (4–23) can then be rewritten to reflect this assumption as follows:  \n\n$$\np_{c}(1\\,-\\,k)A_{1}=\\,p_{e}\\!(A_{2}\\,-\\,A_{1})\n$$  \n\nand the transfer function between $p_{c}$ and $p_{e}$ becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{P_{e}(s)}}={\\frac{A_{2}\\,-\\,A_{1}}{A_{1}}}{\\frac{1}{1\\,-\\,k}}=K_{p}\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{e}$ is defined by Equation (4–20). The controller shown in Figure 4–10 is a proportional controller.The value of gain $K_{p}$ increases as $k$ approaches unity. Note that the value of $k$ depends on the diameters of the orifices in the inlet and outlet pipes of the feedback chamber. (The value of $k$ approaches unity as the resistance to flow in the orifice of the inlet pipe is made smaller.)  \n\nPneumatic Actuating Valves. One characteristic of pneumatic controls is that they almost exclusively employ pneumatic actuating valves.A pneumatic actuating valve can provide a large power output. (Since a pneumatic actuator requires a large power input to produce a large power output, it is necessary that a sufficient quantity of pressurized air be available.) In practical pneumatic actuating valves, the valve characteristics may not be linear; that is, the flow may not be directly proportional to the valve stem position, and also there may be other nonlinear effects, such as hysteresis.  \n\nConsider the schematic diagram of a pneumatic actuating valve shown in Figure 4–11. Assume that the area of the diaphragm is $A$ .Assume also that when the actuating error is zero, the control pressure is equal to $\\overline{{P}}_{c}$ and the valve displacement is equal to $\\bar{X}$ .  \n\nIn the following analysis, we shall consider small variations in the variables and linearize the pneumatic actuating valve. Let us define the small variation in the control pressure and the corresponding valve displacement to be $p_{c}$ and $x$ , respectively. Since a small change in the pneumatic pressure force applied to the diaphragm repositions the load, consisting of the spring, viscous friction, and mass, the force-balance equation becomes  \n\n$$\nA p_{c}\\,=\\,m\\ddot{x}\\,+\\,b\\dot{x}\\,+\\,k x\n$$  \n\nwhere $m={\\mathrm{mass}}$ of the valve and valve stem  \n\n$b=$ viscous-friction coefficient $k=$ spring constant  \n\nIf the force due to the mass and viscous friction are negligibly small, then this last equation can be simplified to  \n\n$$\nA p_{c}=k x\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function between $x$ and $p_{c}$ thus becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{X(s)}{P_{c}(s)}}={\\frac{A}{k}}=K_{c}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a technical drawing of a mechanical device, likely an engine component or valve. The diagram is rendered in black and white, with various components labeled using abbreviations and symbols.\n\n*   **Main Components:**\n    *   A central axis with multiple parts attached to it.\n        *   The axis appears to be a shaft or rod, possibly connected to a gear system or cam mechanism.\n    *   A series of lines and curves that represent the flow of fluid or gas through the device.\n        *   These lines may indicate the path of compressed air, fuel, or exhaust gases within the engine.\n    *   Several small shapes, including circles, rectangles, and triangles, which could represent valves, pistons, or other moving parts.\n        *   These shapes are scattered throughout the diagram, suggesting their importance in the device's operation.\n*   **Labels and Symbols:**\n    *   Various letters (e.g., \"P,\" \"Q,\" \"R\") and symbols (e.g., \",,,\") are used to identify different components or functions within the device.\n        *   These labels likely correspond to specific parts, processes, or parameters relevant to the engine's performance or safety features.\n*   **Arrows:**\n    *   Several arrows point to various locations throughout the diagram, possibly indicating the direction of fluid flow, motion, or other interactions between components.\n        *   The arrows may also suggest how the device operates under different conditions, such as startup, shutdown, or normal running modes.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a detailed technical drawing of an engine component or valve, highlighting its various parts and functions. The diagram is rich in labels, symbols, and arrows that provide insight into the device's inner workings and operational characteristics. 4–11 Schematic diagram of a pneumatic actuating valve.  \n\nwhere $X(s)\\,=\\,{\\mathcal{L}}[x]$ and $P_{c}(s)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}\\big[p_{c}\\big]$ .If $q_{i}$ , the change in flow through the pneumatic actuating valve, is proportional to $x$ , the change in the valve-stem displacement, then  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Q_{i}(s)}{X(s)}}=K_{q}\n$$  \n\nwhere $Q_{i}(s)\\,=\\,{\\mathcal{L}}[q_{i}]$ and $K_{q}$ is a constant. The transfer function between $q_{i}$ and $p_{c}$ becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Q_{i}(s)}{P_{c}(s)}}=K_{c}K_{q}=K_{v}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{v}$ is a constant.  \n\nThe standard control pressure for this kind of a pneumatic actuating valve is between 3 and 15 psig. The valve-stem displacement is limited by the allowable stroke of the diaphragm and is only a few inches. If a longer stroke is needed, a piston–spring combination may be employed.  \n\nIn pneumatic actuating valves, the static-friction force must be limited to a low value so that excessive hysteresis does not result. Because of the compressibility of air, the control action may not be positive; that is, an error may exist in the valve-stem position. The use of a valve positioner results in improvements in the performance of a pneumatic actuating valve.  \n\nBasic Principle for Obtaining Derivative Control Action. We shall now present methods for obtaining derivative control action. We shall again place the emphasis on the principle and not on the details of the actual mechanisms.  \n\nThe basic principle for generating a desired control action is to insert the inverse of the desired transfer function in the feedback path. For the system shown in Figure 4–12, the closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nIf $\\left|G(s)H(s)\\right|\\gg1$ , then $C(s)/R(s)$ can be modified to  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{1}{H(s)}}\n$$  \n\nThus, if proportional-plus-derivative control action is desired, we insert an element having the transfer function $1/(T s\\,+\\,1)$ in the feedback path.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, featuring a transfer function block G(s) and an input signal R(s). The output of the block is then fed into another transfer function block H(s), which generates the response C(s).\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **G(s):** This is a transfer function block that represents the controller or actuator in the system. It takes the input signal R(s) and produces an output that is sent to the next stage.\n*   **R(s):** This represents the reference or setpoint input of the system, which is the desired value that the system should track.\n*   **H(s):** This is another transfer function block that models the dynamics of the plant or process being controlled. It takes the output from G(s) as its input and produces the final response C(s).\n*   **C(s):** This represents the closed-loop response of the system, which is the actual output that results from the combination of the controller (G(s)) and the plant (H(s)).\n\n**Block Diagram Representation:**\n\nThe block diagram shows how these components interact with each other. The input R(s) goes into G(s), which produces an output that is fed into H(s). The output from H(s) then becomes C(s).\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThis block diagram represents a basic control system architecture, where the controller (G(s)) tries to track the reference input (R(s)), and its effectiveness in doing so is influenced by the dynamics of the plant (H(s)). The closed-loop response (C(s)) reflects how well the overall system performs in achieving its desired outcome.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a fundamental control system structure, highlighting the roles of the controller, plant, reference input, and closed-loop response. 4–12 Control system.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram, likely related to control systems or mechanical engineering. The diagram is divided into two sections: (a) and (b).\n\n*   Section (a):\n    *   A rectangular box with various symbols and lines connecting them.\n    *   A curved arrow pointing towards the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.\n    *   Several lines extending from the top-left corner of the rectangle, each ending in a small circle or arrowhead.\n    *   A series of letters and numbers along the edges of the rectangle, possibly indicating coordinates or labels.\n*   Section (b):\n    *   A flowchart with several boxes connected by arrows.\n    *   Each box contains a mathematical expression or variable name.\n    *   The arrows indicate the direction of data flow between the boxes.\n    *   Several lines and curves connecting the boxes, possibly representing additional relationships or constraints.\n\nThe diagram appears to be a schematic representation of a control system or mechanical device, with various components and connections illustrated in detail. The use of symbols, letters, and numbers suggests that the diagram is intended for technical analysis or design purposes. 4–13 (a) Pneumatic proportional controller; (b) block diagram of the controller.  \n\nConsider the pneumatic controller shown in Figure 4–13(a).Considering small changes in the variables,we can draw a block diagram of this controller as shown in Figure 4–13(b). From the block diagram we see that the controller is of proportional type.  \n\nWe shall now show that the addition of a restriction in the negative feedback path will modify the proportional controller to a proportional-plus-derivative controller, or a PD controller.  \n\nConsider the pneumatic controller shown in Figure 4–14(a).Assuming again small changes in the actuating error, nozzle–flapper distance, and control pressure, we can summarize the operation of this controller as follows: Let us first assume a small step change in e.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram, comprising three distinct sections labeled (a), (b), and (c). Each section is accompanied by explanatory text, which provides context for the accompanying diagrams.\n\n*   **Section (a)**\n    *   This section features a complex system with multiple components.\n        *   The diagram includes various symbols, such as arrows, lines, and geometric shapes, to represent different parts of the system.\n        *   The text accompanying this section reads: \"The figure shows a complex system with multiple components. The diagram includes various symbols, such as arrows, lines, and geometric shapes, to represent different parts of the system.\"\n*   **Section (b)**\n    *   This section displays two graphs with distinct patterns.\n        *   The top graph features an oscillating pattern, while the bottom graph exhibits a more gradual slope.\n        *   The text accompanying this section reads: \"The figure shows two graphs with different patterns. The top graph has an oscillating pattern, and the bottom graph has a more gradual slope.\"\n*   **Section (c)**\n    *   This section illustrates a flowchart-like diagram.\n        *   The diagram consists of interconnected boxes and arrows, indicating the flow of information or processes.\n        *   The text accompanying this section reads: \"The figure shows a flowchart-like diagram. The diagram consists of interconnected boxes and arrows, indicating the flow of information or processes.\"\n\nIn summary, the image presents three distinct sections, each featuring a unique diagram with its own set of symbols and patterns. The accompanying text provides context for each section, offering insight into the meaning behind the diagrams. 4–14 (a) Pneumatic proportional-plusderivative controller; (b) step change in $e$ and the corresponding changes in $x$ and $p_{c}$ plotted versus $t$ ; (c) block diagram of the controller.  \n\nThen the change in the control pressure $p_{c}$ will be instantaneous.The restriction $R$ will momentarily prevent the feedback bellows from sensing the pressure change $p_{c}$ .Thus the feedback bellows will not respond momentarily, and the pneumatic actuating valve will feel the full effect of the movement of the flapper.As time goes on,the feedback bellows will expand. The change in the nozzle–flapper distance $x$ and the change in the control pressure $p_{c}$ can be plotted against time $t$ , as shown in Figure 4–14(b).At steady state, the feedback bellows acts like an ordinary feedback mechanism.The curve $p_{c}$ versus $t$ clearly shows that this controller is of the proportional-plus-derivative type.  \n\nA block diagram corresponding to this pneumatic controller is shown in Figure 4–14(c). In the block diagram, $K$ is a constant, $A$ is the area of the bellows, and $k_{s}$ is the equivalent spring constant of the bellows.The transfer function between $p_{c}$ and $e$ can be obtained from the block diagram as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}=\\frac{\\cfrac{b}{a+b}\\,K}{1+\\cfrac{K a}{a+b}\\frac{A}{k_{s}}\\frac{1}{R C s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nIn such a controller the loop gain $\\big|K a A/\\big[(a\\,+\\,b)k_{s}(R C s\\,+\\,1)\\big]\\big|$ is made much greater than unity.Thus the transfer function $P_{c}(s)/E(s)$ can be simplified to give  \n\n$$\n\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}=K_{p}(1\\,+\\,T_{d}s)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nK_{p}=\\frac{b k_{s}}{a A},\\qquad T_{d}=R C\n$$  \n\nThus, delayed negative feedback, or the transfer function $1/(R C s\\,+\\,1)$ in the feedback path, modifies the proportional controller to a proportional-plus-derivative controller.  \n\nNote that if the feedback valve is fully opened, the control action becomes proportional. If the feedback valve is fully closed, the control action becomes narrow-band proportional (on–off).  \n\nObtaining Pneumatic Proportional-Plus-Integral Control Action. Consider the proportional controller shown in Figure 4–13(a). Considering small changes in the variables, we can show that the addition of delayed positive feedback will modify this proportional controller to a proportional-plus-integral controller, or a PI controller.  \n\nConsider the pneumatic controller shown in Figure 4–15(a).The operation of this controller is as follows:The bellows denoted by I is connected to the control pressure source without any restriction. The bellows denoted by II is connected to the control pressure source through a restriction.Let us assume a small step change in the actuating error.This will cause the back pressure in the nozzle to change instantaneously.Thus a change in the control pressure $p_{c}$ also occurs instantaneously. Due to the restriction of the valve in the path to bellows II, there will be a pressure drop across the valve.As time goes on, air will flow across the valve in such a way that the change in pressure in bellows II attains the value $p_{c}$ .Thus bellows II will expand or contract as time elapses in such a way as to move the flapper an additional amount in the direction of the original displacement $e$ .This will cause the back pressure $p_{c}$ in the nozzle to change continuously, as shown in Figure 4–15(b).  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram, comprising four distinct sections labeled (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each section features a unique combination of lines, arrows, and symbols, which collectively convey complex information.\n\n*   **Section (a)**\n    *   This section appears to be a circuit diagram, showcasing a series of interconnected components.\n    *   The components are represented by various shapes and symbols, including rectangles, circles, and triangles.\n    *   Arrows indicate the flow of signals or energy between these components.\n    *   Labels such as \"P_s\", \"R\", \"C\", and \"I\" suggest that this diagram pertains to a specific circuit or system, possibly related to electrical engineering.\n*   **Section (b)**\n    *   This section seems to depict a graphical representation of some data or function.\n    *   It features two axes, one horizontal and one vertical, with various points plotted along these axes.\n    *   The plot includes multiple lines and curves, each representing different aspects of the data.\n    *   Symbols like \"e\" and \"t\" are used to label specific parts of the graph.\n*   **Section (c)**\n    *   This section appears to be a block diagram or flowchart, illustrating a process or system's architecture.\n    *   It consists of various blocks connected by arrows, each representing different stages or components within the process.\n    *   Labels such as \"E(s)\", \"X(s)\", and \"P_c(s)\" suggest that this diagram pertains to control systems or signal processing.\n*   **Section (d)**\n    *   This section also resembles a block diagram or flowchart, similar to Section (c).\n    *   It features a combination of blocks and arrows, indicating different stages or components within a process.\n    *   Symbols like \"K\" and \"1/RCs+1\" are used to label specific parts of the diagram.\n\nIn summary, the image presents four distinct diagrams that collectively convey complex information related to electrical circuits, data representation, control systems, and signal processing. While the exact context or application of these diagrams is unclear without additional context, they likely serve as visual aids for understanding technical concepts in fields such as engineering or computer science. 4–15 (a) Pneumatic proportional-plusintegral controller; (b) step change in $e$ and the corresponding changes in $x$ and $p_{c}$ plotted versus $t$ ; (c) block diagram of the controller; (d) simplified block diagram.  \n\nNote that the integral control action in the controller takes the form of slowly canceling the feedback that the proportional control originally provided.  \n\nA block diagram of this controller under the assumption of small variations in the variables is shown in Figure 4–15(c). A simplification of this block diagram yields Figure 4–15(d).The transfer function of this controller is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}=\\frac{\\cfrac{b}{a+b}\\,K}{1+\\cfrac{K a}{a+b}\\frac{A}{k_{s}}\\left(1-\\cfrac{1}{R C s\\,+\\,1}\\right)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K$ is a constant, $A$ is the area of the bellows,and @C$k_{s}$ is the equivalent spring constant D @ of the combined bellows.If $\\left|K a A R C s/[(a\\,+\\,b)k_{s}(R C s\\,+\\,1)\\right]\\right|\\,\\hat{\\gg}\\,1,$ which is usually the case, the transfer function can be simplified to  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}}=K_{p}\\bigg(1+{\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nK_{p}=\\frac{b k_{s}}{a A},\\qquad T_{i}=R C\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram featuring two distinct sections: (a) and (b).

A combination of the pneumatic controllers shown in Figures 4–14(a) and 4–15(a) yields a proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative controller, or a PID controller. Figure 4–16(a) shows a schematic diagram of such a controller. Figure 4–16(b) shows a block diagram of this controller under the assumption of small variations in the variables.  \n\nThe transfer function of this controller is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}=\\frac{\\cfrac{b K}{a+b}}{1+\\frac{K a}{a+b}\\frac{A}{k_{s}}\\frac{\\bigl(R_{i}C-R_{d}C\\bigr)s}{\\bigl(R_{d}C s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(R_{i}C s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}}\n$$  \n\nBy defining  \n\n$$\nT_{i}=R_{i}C,\\qquad T_{d}=R_{d}C\n$$  \n\nand noting that under normal operation $\\big|K a A\\big(T_{i}-T_{d}\\big)s/\\big[(a+b)k_{s}\\big(T_{d}s+1\\big)\\big(T_{i}s+1\\big)\\big]\\big|\\gg1$ and $T_{i}\\gg T_{d}$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\lefteqn{\\frac{P_{c}(s)}{E(s)}\\div\\frac{b k_{s}}{a A}\\frac{(T_{d}s\\mathrm{~+~}1)\\left(T_{i}s\\mathrm{~+~}1\\right)}{(T_{i}\\mathrm{~-~}T_{d})s}}}\\\\ &{\\nrightarrow\\frac{b k_{s}}{a A}\\frac{T_{d}T_{i}s^{2}\\mathrm{~+~}T_{i}s\\mathrm{~+~}1}{T_{i}s}}\\\\ &{=K_{p}\\bigg(1+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+T_{d}s\\bigg)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nK_{p}={\\frac{b k_{s}}{a A}}\n$$  \n\nEquation (4–24) indicates that the controller shown in Figure 4–16(a) is a proportionalplus-integral-plus-derivative controller or a PID controller.  \n\n# 4–4 HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS  \n\nExcept for low-pressure pneumatic controllers,compressed air has seldom been used for the continuous control of the motion of devices having significant mass under external load forces. For such a case, hydraulic controllers are generally preferred.  \n\nHydraulic Systems. The widespread use of hydraulic circuitry in machine tool applications, aircraft control systems, and similar operations occurs because of such factors as positiveness, accuracy, flexibility, high horsepower-to-weight ratio, fast starting, stopping, and reversal with smoothness and precision, and simplicity of operations.  \n\nThe operating pressure in hydraulic systems is somewhere between 145 and $5000\\,\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{in}.$ .(between 1 and $35\\,\\mathrm{MPa}]$ ). In some special applications, the operating pressure may go up to $10{,}000\\;\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{in}$ .$(70\\;\\mathrm{MPa})$ ). For the same power requirement, the weight and size of the hydraulic unit can be made smaller by increasing the supply pressure. With highpressure hydraulic systems, very large force can be obtained. Rapid-acting, accurate positioning of heavy loads is possible with hydraulic systems. A combination of electronic and hydraulic systems is widely used because it combines the advantages of both electronic control and hydraulic power.  \n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Hydraulic Systems. There are certain advantages and disadvantages in using hydraulic systems rather than other systems. Some of the advantages are the following:  \n\n1. Hydraulic fluid acts as a lubricant, in addition to carrying away heat generated in the system to a convenient heat exchanger.   \n2. Comparatively small-sized hydraulic actuators can develop large forces or torques.   \n3. Hydraulic actuators have a higher speed of response with fast starts, stops, and speed reversals.   \n4. Hydraulic actuators can be operated under continuous, intermittent, reversing, and stalled conditions without damage.   \n5. Availability of both linear and rotary actuators gives flexibility in design.   \n6. Because of low leakages in hydraulic actuators, speed drop when loads are applied is small.  \n\nOn the other hand, several disadvantages tend to limit their use.  \n\n1. Hydraulic power is not readily available compared to electric power.   \n2. Cost of a hydraulic system may be higher than that of a comparable electrical system performing a similar function.   \n3. Fire and explosion hazards exist unless fire-resistant fluids are used.   \n4. Because it is difficult to maintain a hydraulic system that is free from leaks, the system tends to be messy.   \n5. Contaminated oil may cause failure in the proper functioning of a hydraulic system.   \n6. As a result of the nonlinear and other complex characteristics involved, the design of sophisticated hydraulic systems is quite involved.   \n7. Hydraulic circuits have generally poor damping characteristics.If a hydraulic circuit is not designed properly, some unstable phenomena may occur or disappear, depending on the operating condition.  \n\nComments. Particular attention is necessary to ensure that the hydraulic system is stable and satisfactory under all operating conditions. Since the viscosity of hydraulic fluid can greatly affect damping and friction effects of the hydraulic circuits, stability tests must be carried out at the highest possible operating temperature.  \n\nNote that most hydraulic systems are nonlinear. Sometimes, however, it is possible to linearize nonlinear systems so as to reduce their complexity and permit solutions that are sufficiently accurate for most purposes.A useful linearization technique for dealing with nonlinear systems was presented in Section 2–7.  \n\nHydraulic Servo System. Figure 4–17(a) shows a hydraulic servomotor. It is essentially a pilot-valve-controlled hydraulic power amplifier and actuator. The pilot valve is a balanced valve,in the sense that the pressure forces acting on it are all balanced. A very large power output can be controlled by a pilot valve, which can be positioned with very little power.  \n\nIn practice, the ports shown in Figure 4–17(a) are often made wider than the corresponding valves. In such a case, there is always leakage through the valves. Such leakage improves both the sensitivity and the linearity of the hydraulic servomotor. In the following analysis we shall make the assumption that the ports are made wider than the valves—that is, the valves are underlapped. [Note that sometimes a dither signal, a high-frequency signal of very small amplitude (with respect to the maximum displacement of the valve), is superimposed on the motion of the pilot valve. This also improves the sensitivity and linearity.In this case also there is leakage through the valve.]  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating the components and relationships of a mechanical system. The diagram is divided into two sections, labeled \"a\" and \"b,\" which provide a detailed view of the system's internal workings.\n\n**Section A:**\n\n*   **Components:**\n    *   The diagram features a series of interconnected pipes, valves, and pumps.\n    *   The pipes are labeled with arrows indicating the direction of fluid flow.\n    *   Valves are represented by rectangular blocks with rounded edges, connected to the pipes via short lines.\n    *   Pumps are depicted as cylindrical shapes with rounded ends, attached to the pipes.\n*   **Connections:**\n    *   The valves and pumps are connected to each other through the pipes.\n    *   The connections between the components are labeled with numbers and letters (e.g., \"1,\" \"2,\" \"3\").\n*   **Labels and Annotations:**\n    *   Various labels and annotations are scattered throughout the diagram, providing information about the system's operation.\n    *   These include arrows indicating fluid flow direction, symbols representing different types of valves or pumps, and numerical values (e.g., \"4\").\n\n**Section B:**\n\n*   **Components:**\n    *   This section appears to be a cross-sectional view of one of the pipes from Section A.\n    *   The pipe is shown with a circular shape, featuring a valve at its center.\n*   **Connections:**\n    *   The valve is connected to two smaller pipes, which are labeled \"1\" and \"2.\"\n*   **Labels and Annotations:**\n    *   Labels and annotations similar to those in Section A are present here as well.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe diagram provides a detailed representation of the mechanical system's components and their relationships. It illustrates how the valves, pumps, and pipes interact with each other to facilitate fluid flow within the system. The labels and annotations offer additional context, allowing for a deeper understanding of the system's operation. Overall, the diagram serves as a useful tool for engineers and technicians seeking to analyze and optimize the performance of this mechanical system. 4–17 (a) Hydraulic servo system; (b) enlarged diagram of the valve orifice area.   \n(b)  \n\nWe shall apply the linearization technique presented in Section 2–7 to obtain a linearized mathematical model of the hydraulic servomotor. We assume that the valve is underlapped and symmetrical and admits hydraulic fluid under high pressure into a power cylinder that contains a large piston, so that a large hydraulic force is established to move a load.  \n\nIn Figure 4–17(b) we have an enlarged diagram of the valve orifice area. Let us define the valve orifice areas of ports 1, 2, 3, 4 as $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},A_{4}$ ,respectively.Also, define the flow rates through ports $1,2,3,4$ as $q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},q_{4}$ ,respectively. Note that, since the valve is symmetrical, $A_{1}=A_{3}$ and $A_{2}=A_{4}$ .Assuming the displacement $x$ to be small, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{A_{1}=A_{3}=k\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+x\\bigg)}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{}}}\\\\ {{A_{2}=A_{4}=k\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-x\\bigg)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $k$ is a constant.  \n\nFurthermore, we shall assume that the return pressure 1 $p_{o}$ in the return line is small and thus can be neglected. Then, referring to Figure 4–17(a), flow rates through valve orifices are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{q_{1}=c_{1}A_{1}\\sqrt{\\frac{2g}{\\gamma}\\left(p_{s}-p_{1}\\right)}=C_{1}\\sqrt{p_{s}-p_{1}}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+x\\right)}\\\\ &{q_{2}=c_{2}A_{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2g}{\\gamma}\\left(p_{s}-p_{2}\\right)}=C_{2}\\sqrt{p_{s}-p_{2}}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-x\\right)}\\\\ &{q_{3}=c_{1}A_{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{2g}{\\gamma}\\left(p_{2}-p_{0}\\right)}=C_{1}\\sqrt{p_{2}-p_{0}}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+x\\right)=C_{1}\\sqrt{p_{2}}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+x\\right)}\\\\ &{q_{4}=c_{2}A_{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{2g}{\\gamma}\\left(p_{1}-p_{0}\\right)}=C_{2}\\sqrt{p_{1}-p_{0}}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-x\\right)=C_{2}\\sqrt{p_{1}}\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-x\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $C_{1}=c_{1}k\\sqrt{2g/\\gamma}$ and $C_{2}=c_{2}k\\sqrt{2g/\\gamma}$ 1 ,and $\\gamma$ is the specific weight and is given by 1 $\\gamma=\\rho g$ , where $\\rho$ is mass density and $g$ is the acceleration of gravity.

Since the valve is symmetrical, we have $q_{1}=q_{3}$ and $q_{2}=q_{4}$ .By equating $q_{1}$ and $q_{3}$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\np_{s}\\,-\\,p_{1}\\,=\\,p_{2}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\np_{s}=\\,p_{1}\\,+\\,p_{2}\n$$  \n\nIf we define the pressure difference across the power piston as $\\Delta p$ or  \n\n$$\n\\Delta p\\,=\\,p_{1}\\,-\\,p_{2}\n$$  \n\nthen  \n\n$$\np_{1}=\\frac{p_{s}+\\Delta p}{2},\\qquad p_{2}=\\frac{p_{s}-\\Delta p}{2}\n$$  \n\nFor the symmetrical valve shown in Figure 4–17(a), the pressure in each side of the power piston is $(1/2)p_{s}$ when no load is applied, or $\\Delta p=0.$ .As the spool valve is displaced, the pressure in one line increases as the pressure in the other line decreases by the same amount.  \n\nIn terms of $p_{s}$ and $\\Delta p$ ,we can rewrite the flow rate $q$ given by Equation (4–25) as  \n\n$$\nq=q_{1}-q_{4}=C_{1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}-\\,\\Delta p}{2}}\\bigg(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+\\,x\\bigg)\\,-\\,C_{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}+\\,\\Delta p}{2}}\\bigg(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-\\,x\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nNoting that the supply pressure $p_{s}$ is constant. the flow rate $q$ can be written as a function of the valve displacement $x$ and pressure difference $\\Delta p$ ,or  \n\n$$\nq=C_{1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}-\\,\\Delta p}{2}}\\bigg(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+\\,x\\bigg)\\,-\\,C_{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}+\\,\\Delta p}{2}}\\bigg(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-\\,x\\bigg)\\,=\\,f(x,\\Delta p)\n$$  \n\nBy applying the linearization technique presented in Section 3–10 to this case,the linearized equation about point $x\\,=\\,\\bar{x}$ ,$\\Delta p\\,=\\,\\Delta\\bar{p},q\\,=\\,\\bar{q}$ is  \n\n$$\nq\\,-\\,{\\bar{q}}\\,=\\,a(x\\,-\\,{\\bar{x}}\\,)\\,+\\,b(\\Delta p\\,-\\,\\Delta{\\bar{p}})\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\bar{q}=f(\\bar{x},\\Delta\\bar{p})}&{}\\\\ {a=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=\\bar{x},\\,\\Delta p=\\Delta p}}&{=C_{1}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}-\\Delta\\bar{p}}{2}}+C_{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}+\\Delta\\bar{p}}{2}}}\\\\ {b=\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial\\Delta p}\\bigg|_{x=\\bar{x},\\,\\Delta p=\\Delta\\bar{p}}=-\\bigg[\\frac{C_{1}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\sqrt{p_{s}-\\Delta\\bar{p}}}\\,\\bigg(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}+\\bar{x}\\bigg)}\\\\ &{\\,\\,+\\,\\frac{C_{2}}{2\\sqrt{2}\\,\\sqrt{p_{s}+\\Delta\\bar{p}}}\\,\\bigg(\\frac{x_{0}}{2}-\\bar{x}\\bigg)\\bigg]<0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nCoefficients $a$ and $^b$ here are called valve coefficients . Equation (4–26) is a linearized mathematical model of the spool valve near an operating point $x\\,=\\,\\overline{{x}}$ –,$\\Delta p\\,=\\,\\Delta\\bar{p},q\\,=\\,\\bar{q}$ .The values of valve coefficients $a$ and $^b$ vary with the operating point. Note that $\\partial f/\\partial\\Delta p$ is negative and so $^b$ is negative.  \n\nSince the normal operating point is the point where $\\bar{x}\\,=\\,0,\\,\\Delta\\bar{p}\\,=\\,0,\\,\\bar{q}\\,=\\,0$ ,near the normal operating point Equation (4–26) becomes  \n\n$$\nq\\,=\\,K_{1}x\\,-\\,K_{2}\\,\\Delta p\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K_{1}=\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{p_{s}}{2}}>0}}\\\\ {{\\ }}\\\\ {{K_{2}=\\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\\right)\\frac{x_{0}}{4\\sqrt{2}\\,\\sqrt{p_{s}}}>0}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEquation (4–27) is a linearized mathematical model of the spool valve near the origin $\\acute{\\bar{x}}\\,=\\,0,\\,\\Delta\\bar{p}\\,=\\,0,\\,\\bar{q}\\,=\\,0.$ )Note that the region near the origin is most important in this kind of system, because the system operation usually occurs near this point.  \n\nFigure 4–18 shows this linearized relationship among $q,x$ ,and $\\Delta P$ .The straight lines shown are the characteristic curves of the linearized hydraulic servomotor.This family of curves consists of equidistant parallel straight lines, parametrized by $x$ .  \n\nIn the present analysis we assume that the load reactive forces are small, so that the leakage flow rate and oil compressibility can be ignored.  \n\nReferring to Figure 4–17(a), we see that the rate of flow of oil $q$ times $d t$ is equal to the power-piston displacement $d y$ times the piston area $A$ times the density of oil $\\rho$ .Thus, we obtain  \n\n$$\nA\\rho\\,d y\\,=\\,q\\,d t\n$$  \n\nNotice that for a given flow rate $q$ the larger the piston area $A$ is, the lower will be the velocity $d y/d t$ . Hence, if the piston area $A$ is made smaller, the other variables remaining constant, the velocity $d y/d t$ will become higher.Also, an increased flow rate $q$ will cause an increased velocity of the power piston and will make the response time shorter.  \n\nEquation (4–27) can now be written as  \n\n$$\n\\Delta P={\\frac{1}{K_{2}}}\\left(K_{1}x\\,-\\,A\\rho\\,{\\frac{d y}{d t}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nThe force developed by the power piston is equal to the pressure difference $\\Delta P$ times the piston area $A$ or  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\mathrm{Force~developed~by~the~power~piston}}=A\\ \\Delta P}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad={\\cfrac{A}{K_{2}}}\\left(K_{1}x\\,-\\,A\\rho\\,{\\cfrac{d y}{d t}}\\right)}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThis image is a black-and-white line graph that displays several diagonal lines, each representing a unique function. The x-axis is labeled \"x = 0\" to \"x = -2x1,\" while the y-axis is labeled \"q.\" A horizontal axis is also present, marked as \"ΔP.\"\n\nThe graph features five diagonal lines, each with a distinct slope and intercept. These lines are identified by the equation of their respective functions.\n\n*   The topmost line corresponds to the function **f(x) = x**.\n*   The second line from the top represents the function **f(x) = 2x**.\n*   The third line is associated with the function **f(x) = -x**.\n*   The fourth line corresponds to the function **f(x) = -2x**, while\n*   The bottommost line represents the function **f(x) = x1**.\n\nThe graph's background is a clean white, providing a clear visual representation of the functions. 4–18 Characteristic curves of the linearized hydraulic servomotor.  \n\nFor a given maximum force, if the pressure difference is sufficiently high, the piston area, or the volume of oil in the cylinder, can be made small. Consequently, to minimize the weight of the controller, we must make the supply pressure sufficiently high.  \n\nAssume that the power piston moves a load consisting of a mass and viscous friction. Then the force developed by the power piston is applied to the load mass and friction, and we obtain  \n\n$$\nm\\ddot{y}\\,+\\,b\\dot{y}\\,=\\frac{A}{K_{2}}\\big(K_{1}x\\,-\\,A\\rho\\dot{y}\\big)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nm\\ddot{y}\\,+\\,\\biggl(b\\,+\\frac{A^{2}\\rho}{K_{2}}\\biggr)\\dot{y}\\,=\\frac{A K_{1}}{K_{2}}\\,x\n$$  \n\nwhere $_m$ is the mass of the load and $^b$ is the viscous-friction coefficient.  \n\nAssuming that the pilot-valve displacement $x$ is the input and the power-piston displacement $y$ is the output, we find that the transfer function for the hydraulic servomotor is, from Equation (4–28),  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{s\\Big[\\Big(\\displaystyle\\frac{m K_{2}}{A K_{1}}\\Big)s+\\displaystyle\\frac{b K_{2}}{A K_{1}}+\\displaystyle\\frac{A\\rho}{K_{1}}\\Big]}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{K}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nK={\\frac{1}{{\\frac{b K_{2}}{A K_{1}}}+{\\frac{A\\rho}{K_{1}}}}}\\qquad{\\mathrm{and}}\\qquad T={\\frac{m K_{2}}{b K_{2}+A^{2}\\rho}}\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation (4–29) we see that this transfer function is of the second order.If the ratio $m K_{2}/\\bigl(b\\hat{K}_{2}\\,+\\,A^{2}\\rho\\bigr)$ is negligibly small or the time constant $T$ is negligible, the transfer function $Y(s)/X(s)$ can be simplified to give  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}}={\\frac{K}{s}}\n$$  \n\nIt is noted that a more detailed analysis shows that if oil leakage, compressibility (including the effects of dissolved air), expansion of pipelines, and the like are taken into consideration, the transfer function becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}}={\\frac{K}{s(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ are time constants.As a matter of fact, these time constants depend on the volume of oil in the operating circuit.The smaller the volume, the smaller the time constants.  \n\nHydraulic Integral Controller. The hydraulic servomotor shown in Figure 4–19 is a pilot-valve-controlled hydraulic power amplifier and actuator. Similar to the hydraulic servo system shown in Figure 4–17, for negligibly small load mass the servomotor shown in Figure 4–19 acts as an integrator or an integral controller. Such a servomotor constitutes the basis of the hydraulic control circuit.  \n\nIn the hydraulic servomotor shown in Figure 4–19, the pilot valve (a four-way valve) has two lands on the spool. If the width of the land is smaller than the port in the valve sleeve,the valve is said to be underlapped .Overlapped valves have a land width greater than the port width.A zero-lapped valve has a land width that is identical to the port width. (If the pilot valve is a zero-lapped valve,analyses of hydraulic servomotors become simpler.)  \n\nIn the present analysis, we assume that hydraulic fluid is incompressible and that the inertia force of the power piston and load is negligible compared to the hydraulic force at the power piston.We also assume that the pilot valve is a zero-lapped valve, and the oil flow rate is proportional to the pilot valve displacement.  \n\nOperation of this hydraulic servomotor is as follows. If input $x$ moves the pilot valve to the right, port II is uncovered, and so high-pressure oil enters the right-hand side of the power piston. Since port I is connected to the drain port, the oil in the left-hand side of the power piston is returned to the drain. The oil flowing into the power cylinder is at high pressure; the oil flowing out from the power cylinder into the drain is at low pressure. The resulting difference in pressure on both sides of the power piston will cause it to move to the left.  \n\nNote that the rate of flow of oil $q$ $(\\mathrm{kg/sec})$ times dt (sec )is equal to the power-piston displacement dy (m)times the piston area $A$ $(\\mathbf{m}^{2})$ )times the density of oil $\\rho$ $(\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})$ .Therefore,  \n\n$$\nA\\rho\\,d y\\,=\\,q\\,d t\n$$  \n\nBecause of the assumption that the oil flow rate $q$ is proportional to the pilot-valve displacement $x$ , we have  \n\n$$\nq\\,=\\,K_{1}x\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{1}$ is a positive constant. From Equations (4–30) and (4–31) we obtain  \n\n$$\nA\\rho\\,{\\frac{d y}{d t}}=K_{1}x\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a mechanical system, likely an oil pump or engine component. The system consists of various components connected by pipes and tubes.\n\n*   **Pipes:**\n    *   Two horizontal pipes are visible at the top of the image.\n    *   They appear to be connected to each other and to other components in the system.\n    *   One pipe is labeled \"Oil under pressure.\"\n*   **Valves:**\n    *   A valve is located near the center of the image.\n    *   It has a cylindrical body with a round handle on top.\n    *   The valve is connected to several pipes and tubes.\n*   **Tubes:**\n    *   Several tubes are visible throughout the image.\n    *   They are connected to various components, including valves, cylinders, and pistons.\n    *   Some tubes appear to be thicker than others, suggesting they may carry different types of fluid or gases.\n*   **Cylinders:**\n    *   Two cylindrical objects are visible in the lower half of the image.\n    *   They have rounded ends and are connected to several tubes.\n    *   The cylinders appear to be part of a larger system, possibly an engine or pump.\n*   **Pistons:**\n    *   A piston is visible inside one of the cylinders.\n    *   It has a rounded head and is connected to a rod that extends out of the cylinder.\n    *   The piston appears to be moving up and down within the cylinder.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a complex mechanical system consisting of pipes, valves, tubes, cylinders, and pistons. The system appears to be designed for oil or gas flow, with multiple components working together to facilitate movement or pressure transfer. 4–19 Hydraulic servomotor.   \nChapter 4 /Mathematical Modeling of Fluid Systems and Thermal Systems  \n\nThe Laplace transform of this last equation, assuming a zero initial condition, gives  \n\n$$\nA\\rho s Y(s)\\,=\\,K_{1}X(s)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}}={\\frac{K_{1}}{A\\rho s}}={\\frac{K}{s}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K\\,=\\,K_{1}/(A\\rho)$ . Thus the hydraulic servomotor shown in Figure 4–19 acts as an integral controller.  \n\nHydraulic Proportional Controller. It has been shown that the servomotor in Figure 4–19 acts as an integral controller. This servomotor can be modified to a proportional controller by means of a feedback link. Consider the hydraulic controller shown in Figure 4–20(a).The left-hand side of the pilot valve is joined to the left-hand side of the power piston by a link ABC .This link is a floating link rather than one moving about a fixed pivot.  \n\nThe controller here operates in the following way. If input emoves the pilot valve to the right, port II will be uncovered and high-pressure oil will flow through port II into the right-hand side of the power piston and force this piston to the left.The power piston, in moving to the left, will carry the feedback link $A B C$ with it, thereby moving the pilot valve to the left.This action continues until the pilot piston again covers ports I and II.A block diagram of the system can be drawn as in Figure 4–20(b).The transfer function between $Y(s)$ and $E(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{E(s)}}={\\frac{\\cfrac{b}{a+b}}{1+{\\frac{K}{s}}{\\frac{a}{a+b}}}}\n$$  \n\nNoting that under the normal operating conditions we have $\\left|K a/\\!\\left[s(a\\,+\\,b)\\right]\\right|\\,\\gg\\,1$ this last equation can be simplified to  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{E(s)}}={\\frac{b}{a}}=K_{p}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a technical diagram of an oil under pressure system, featuring three primary components: A, B, and C. Component A is situated on the left side, with two arrows pointing towards component B, which is positioned centrally. Component C is located on the right side.\n\nComponent A features two circular symbols at its top end, accompanied by a long arrow pointing downwards to the left. This suggests that component A may be connected to a reservoir or a source of oil, and the arrow indicates the direction of flow.\n\nComponent B has a small circle at its top center, with an arrow directed upwards from it. Two arrows emanate from this circle, one pointing towards the right (towards component C) and another pointing towards the left (towards component A). This implies that component B is likely a valve or a regulator, controlling the flow of oil between components A and C.\n\nComponent C features an arrow directed upwards from its center, indicating that it may be connected to a pump or a motor. The presence of arrows pointing towards both components A and B suggests that component C could be responsible for pressurizing the oil, which would then be regulated by component B before being released through component A.\n\nOverall, the diagram appears to illustrate a system designed to manage and regulate the flow of oil under pressure, with each component playing a crucial role in ensuring efficient operation. 4–20 (a) Servomotor that acts as a proportional controller; (b) block diagram of the servomotor.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, likely representing a control system or signal processing application. The diagram is divided into three main sections: input, processing, and output.\n\n*   **Input Section**\n    *   The input section consists of an arrow labeled \"E(s)\" pointing to a block containing the expression \"(b/a+b)\". This suggests that the input signal E(s) undergoes some transformation before being passed on to the next stage.\n*   **Processing Section**\n    *   In the processing section, there are two blocks connected by arrows. The top block contains the expression \"X(s)\" and has an arrow pointing out of it towards a plus sign (+). The bottom block has the expression \"(a/a+b)\" inside it and also points to the same plus sign (+).\n    *   A second arrow from the bottom block leads to another block with the label \"Y(s)\".\n*   **Output Section**\n    *   From the output section, an arrow labeled \"Y(s)\" points back towards the input section, indicating feedback or a return of processed information.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a system where an input signal E(s) is processed by two blocks containing mathematical expressions before being fed into a summation point. The result then flows out as Y(s), which may eventually be fed back into the system through another path not explicitly shown in this diagram but implied by the presence of \"Y(s)\" at both ends. This setup could represent various types of control systems or signal processing algorithms depending on the specific values assigned to 'a' and 'b'.  \n\nThe transfer function between $y$ and $e$ becomes a constant.Thus,the hydraulic controller shown in Figure 4–20(a) acts as a proportional controller,the gain of which is $K_{p}$ .This gain can be adjusted by effectively changing the lever ratio $b/a$ . (The adjusting mechanism is not shown in the diagram.)  \n\nWe have thus seen that the addition of a feedback link will cause the hydraulic servomotor to act as a proportional controller.  \n\nDashpots. The dashpot (also called a damper) shown in Figure 4–21(a) acts as a differentiating element.Suppose that we introduce a step displacement to the piston position $y$ .Then the displacement $z$ becomes equal to $y$ momentarily.Because of the spring force,however,the oil will flow through the resistance $R$ and the cylinder will come back to the original position.The curves $y$ versus $t$ and $z$ versus $t$ are shown in Figure 4–21(b).  \n\nLet us derive the transfer function between the displacement $z$ and displacement $y$ .Define the pressures existing on the right and left sides of the piston as $P_{1}(\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{in}.^{2})$ and $P_{2}(\\mathrm{lb}_{\\mathrm{f}}/\\mathrm{in}.^{2})$ ,respectively. Suppose that the inertia force involved is negligible.Then the force acting on the piston must balance the spring force.Thus  \n\n$$\nA\\big(P_{1}\\,-\\,P_{2}\\big)\\,=\\,k z\n$$  \n\nwhere $A=$ piston area, in.  \n\n$k=$ spring constant, $\\mathrm{1b_{f}/i n}$ .  \n\nThe flow rate $q$ is given by  \n\n$$\nq=\\frac{P_{1}-P_{2}}{R}\n$$  \n\nwhere $q=$ flow rate through the restriction, lb 'sec  \n\n$R=$ resistance to flow at the restriction, lb f-sec 'in. -lb  \n\nSince the flow through the restriction during dt seconds must equal the change in the mass of oil to the left of the piston during the same dt seconds, we obtain  \n\n$$\nq\\,d t=\\,A\\rho(d y\\,-\\,d z)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\rho=$ density, $1\\mathrm{b}/\\mathrm{in}.^{3}$ . (We assume that the fluid is incompressible or $\\rho=$ constant.) This last equation can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d y}{d t}}-{\\frac{d z}{d t}}={\\frac{q}{A\\rho}}={\\frac{P_{1}-P_{2}}{R A\\rho}}={\\frac{k z}{R A^{2}\\rho}}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating a system comprising three distinct components: **(a)**, **(b)**, and **(c)**. Each component is accompanied by its corresponding equation.\n\n*   **(a)**\n    *   The first component features two pipes labeled \"P1\" and \"P2\", with an arrow pointing from P1 to P2.\n        *   An equation is provided: q = R\n            *   This equation appears to describe the relationship between flow rate (q) and resistance (R).\n*   **(b)**\n    *   The second component consists of a series of symbols, including a circle with an arrow pointing towards it, a line with an arrowhead at one end, and a rectangle containing a symbol.\n        *   An equation is presented: Y(s) = 1 / Ts\n            *   This equation suggests that the transfer function (Y(s)) is related to time constant (Ts).\n*   **(c)**\n    *   The third component comprises a series of symbols, including a circle with an arrow pointing away from it, a line with an arrowhead at one end, and a rectangle containing a symbol.\n        *   An equation is provided: Z(s) = T = RA^2 / k\n            *   This equation indicates that the transfer function (Z(s)) is related to resistance (R), area (A), and constant k.\n\nThe diagram appears to be a representation of a system with multiple components, each described by its own set of equations. The equations involve variables such as flow rate, time constant, resistance, area, and constants like RA^2/k. However, without additional context or information about the specific application or field being represented, it is challenging to provide a more detailed explanation or interpretation of these equations. 4–21 (a) Dashpot; (b) step change in $y$ and the corresponding change in $z$ plotted versus $t$ ; (c) block diagram of the dashpot.  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d y}{d t}=\\frac{d z}{d t}+\\frac{k z}{R A^{2}\\rho}\n$$  \n\nTaking the Laplace transforms of both sides of this last equation, assuming zero initial conditions, we obtain  \n\n$$\ns Y(s)\\,=\\,s Z(s)\\,+\\,{\\frac{k}{R A_{\\rho}^{2}}}\\,Z(s)\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function of this system thus becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Z(s)}{Y(s)}}={\\frac{s}{\\displaystyle s+{\\frac{k}{R A^{2}\\rho}}}}\n$$  \n\nLet us define $R A^{2}\\rho/k=T$ .(Note that $R A^{2}\\rho/k$ has the dimension of time.) Then  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Z(s)}{Y(s)}=\\frac{T s}{T s\\,+\\,1}=\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{T s}}\n$$  \n\nClearly, the dashpot is a differentiating element. Figure 4–21(c) shows a block diagram representation for this system.  \n\nObtaining Hydraulic Proportional-Plus-Integral Control Action. Figure 4–22(a) shows a schematic diagram of a hydraulic proportional-plus-integral controller.A block diagram of this controller is shown in Figure 4–22(b).

Thermal systems may be analyzed in terms of resistance and capacitance, although the thermal capacitance and thermal resistance may not be represented accurately as lumped parameters, since they are usually distributed throughout the substance. For precise analysis, distributed-parameter models must be used. Here, however, to simplify the analysis we shall assume that a thermal system can be represented by a lumped-parameter model, that substances that are characterized by resistance to heat flow have negligible heat capacitance, and that substances that are characterized by heat capacitance have negligible resistance to heat flow.  \n\nThere are three different ways heat can flow from one substance to another: conduction, convection, and radiation. Here we consider only conduction and convection. (Radiation heat transfer is appreciable only if the temperature of the emitter is very high compared to that of the receiver.Most thermal processes in process control systems do not involve radiation heat transfer.)  \n\nFor conduction or convection heat transfer,  \n\n$$\nq\\,=\\,K\\;\\Delta\\theta\n$$  \n\nwhere $q=$ heat flow rate, kcal 'sec $\\Delta\\theta\\,=$ temperature difference, $^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}$ $K=$ coefficient, kcal 'sec $^\\circ C$  \n\nThe coefficient $K$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{K={\\frac{k A}{\\Delta X}},\\quad}&{{\\mathrm{for~conduction}}}\\\\ {=H A,\\quad}&{{\\mathrm{for~convection}}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $k=$ thermal conductivity, kcal 'm sec $^\\circ C$ $A=$ area normal to heat flow, $\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{m}}^{2}$ $\\Delta X=$ thickness of conductor, m $H=$ convection coefficient, kcal '$\\mathrm{~m}^{2}$ sec $^\\circ C$  \n\nThermal Resistance and Thermal Capacitance. The thermal resistance $R$ for heat transfer between two substances may be defined as follows:  \n\n$$\nR={\\frac{{\\mathrm{change~in~temperature~difference}},{\\mathrm{}}^{\\circ}C}{{\\mathrm{change~in~heat~flow~rate}},{\\mathrm{kcal}}/{\\mathrm{sec}}}}\n$$  \n\nThe thermal resistance for conduction or convection heat transfer is given by  \n\n$$\nR=\\frac{d(\\Delta\\theta)}{d q}=\\frac{1}{K}\n$$  \n\nSince the thermal conductivity and convection coefficients are almost constant, the thermal resistance for either conduction or convection is constant.  \n\nThe thermal capacitance $C$ is defined by  \n\n$$\nC={\\frac{\\mathrm{change~in~heat~stored,~kcal}}{\\mathrm{change~in~temperature,~}^{\\circ}C}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nC\\,=\\,m c\n$$  \n\nwhere $m\\,=\\,{\\mathrm{mass}}$ of substance considered, kg $c=$ specific heat of substance, $\\mathrm{kcal/kg\\,^{\\circ}C}$  \n\nThermal System. Consider the system shown in Figure 4–26(a). It is assumed that the tank is insulated to eliminate heat loss to the surrounding air. It is also assumed that there is no heat storage in the insulation and that the liquid in the tank is perfectly mixed so that it is at a uniform temperature.Thus,a single temperature is used to describe the temperature of the liquid in the tank and of the outflowing liquid.  \n\nLet us define  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\bar{\\theta}_{i}=\\mathrm{steady-state~temperature~of~inflowing~liquid,\\,of~}}\\\\ &{\\bar{\\theta}_{o}=\\mathrm{steady-state~temperature~of~outflowing~liquid,\\,of~}}\\\\ &{\\alpha=\\mathrm{steady-state~liquid~flow~rate,~kg/sec~}}\\\\ &{M=\\mathrm{~mass~of~liquid~in~tank,kg}}\\\\ &{c=\\mathrm{specific~heat~of~liquid,~kcal/kg~^cC~}}\\\\ &{R=\\mathrm{~thermal~resistance,\\!~\\!c~sec/kcal}}\\\\ &{C=\\mathrm{~thermal~capacitance,~kcal/\\circC~}}\\\\ &{\\bar{H}=\\mathrm{~steady-state~heat~input~rate,kcal/sec~}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAssume that the temperature of the inflowing liquid is kept constant and that the heat input rate to the system (heat supplied by the heater) is suddenly changed from $\\bar{H}$ to $\\bar{H}^{\\ }+\\,h_{i}$ will then change gradually from uid will also be changed from ,where $h_{i}$ represents a small change in the heat input rate.The heat outflow rate $\\bar{\\theta}_{o}$ $\\bar{H}$ to to $\\overline{{\\theta}}_{o}+\\theta$ –$\\bar{H}^{\\ \\ +}\\ h_{o}$ .For this case, .The temperature of the outflowing liq$h_{o}$ ,$C$ , and $R$ are obtained, respectively, as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{h_{o}=G c\\theta}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{~}}}\\\\ {{C=M c}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{~}}}\\\\ {{R=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\theta}{h_{o}}=\\frac{1}{G c}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe heat-balance equation for this system is  \n\n$$\nC\\,d\\theta=\\left(h_{i}\\,-\\,h_{o}\\right)d t\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a heat exchanger, accompanied by a control system. The heat exchanger is depicted as a rectangular box with two inputs and one output.\n\n**Heat Exchanger Components:**\n\n*   **Cold Liquid Input:** A cold liquid enters the heat exchanger from the left side.\n*   **Heater:** Inside the heat exchanger, there is a heater that warms up the cold liquid.\n*   **Mixer:** The warmed-up cold liquid then mixes with hot liquid entering from the right side of the heat exchanger.\n*   **Hot Liquid Output:** The mixed fluid exits the heat exchanger on the right side.\n\n**Control System:**\n\nThe control system is represented by a series of blocks and lines connecting them. Each block represents a component or process in the system, while the lines indicate the flow of signals between these components.\n\n*   **Temperature Sensor:** A temperature sensor measures the temperature of the mixed fluid exiting the heat exchanger.\n*   **Controller:** The controller receives the measured temperature signal and compares it to a setpoint value. Based on this comparison, the controller sends an appropriate control signal to the heater.\n*   **Heater:** The heater adjusts its output according to the control signal received from the controller. This adjustment affects the temperature of the cold liquid inside the heat exchanger.\n*   **Feedback Loop:** The feedback loop is closed through the temperature sensor, which continuously monitors the mixed fluid's temperature and sends this information back to the controller.\n\n**Overall System Functionality:**\n\nThe overall system function is to maintain a constant temperature of the mixed fluid exiting the heat exchanger. This is achieved by controlling the amount of heat added to the cold liquid based on its measured temperature. The control system ensures that the mixed fluid's temperature remains within a specified range, regardless of changes in the input temperatures or flow rates.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n*   The heat exchanger and control system work together to maintain a constant temperature.\n*   The controller uses feedback from the temperature sensor to adjust the heater's output.\n*   The system is designed to be self-regulating, meaning it can adapt to changes in operating conditions without manual intervention.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a block diagram of a heat exchanger with a control system that maintains a constant temperature. The control system uses feedback from a temperature sensor to adjust the heater's output and ensure that the mixed fluid exits at a consistent temperature. 4–26 (a) Thermal system: (b) block diagram of the system.  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nC\\,{\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}}=h_{i}\\,-\\,h_{o}\n$$  \n\nwhich may be rewritten as  \n\n$$\nR C\\,{\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}}+\\,\\theta\\,=\\,R h_{i}\n$$  \n\nNote that the time constant of the system is equal to $R C$ or $M/G$ seconds.The transfer function relating $\\theta$ and $h_{i}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\theta(s)}{H_{i}(s)}}={\\frac{R}{R C s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Theta(s)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}\\big[\\theta(t)\\big]$ and $H_{i}(s)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}\\big[h_{i}(t)\\big]$ .  \n\nIn practice, the temperature of the inflowing liquid may fluctuate and may act as a load disturbance. (If a constant outflow temperature is desired, an automatic controller may be installed to adjust the heat inflow rate to compensate for the fluctuations in the temperature of the inflowing liquid.) If the temperature of the inflowing liquid is suddenly changed from $\\overline{{\\Theta}}_{i}$ to $\\bar{\\theta}_{i}+\\bar{\\theta}_{i}$ while the heat input rate $H$ and the liquid flow rate $G$ are kept constant, then the heat outflow rate will be changed from $\\bar{H}$ to $\\bar{H}^{\\mathrm{~+~}}h_{o}$ ,and the temperature of the outflowing liquid will be changed from $\\overline{{\\theta}}_{o}$ to $\\overline{{\\Theta}}_{o}+\\,\\theta.$ .The heatbalance equation for this case is  \n\n$$\nC\\;d\\theta=\\left(G c\\theta_{i}\\;-\\;h_{o}\\right)d t\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nC\\,{\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}}=G c\\theta_{i}\\,-\\,h_{o}\n$$  \n\nwhich may be rewritten  \n\n$$\nR C\\,{\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}}+\\,\\theta\\,=\\,\\theta_{i}\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function relating $\\theta$ and $\\theta_{i}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta(s)}{\\theta_{i}(s)}=\\frac{1}{R C s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\Theta(s)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}\\big[\\theta(t)\\big]$ and $\\Theta_{i}(s)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}\\big[\\theta_{i}(t)\\big]$ .  \n\nIf the present thermal system is subjected to changes in both the temperature of the inflowing liquid and the heat input rate, while the liquid flow rate is kept constant, the change $\\theta$ in the temperature of the outflowing liquid can be given by the following equation:  \n\n$$\nR C\\,{\\frac{d\\theta}{d t}}+\\,\\theta\\,=\\,\\theta_{i}\\,+\\,R h_{i}\n$$  \n\nA block diagram corresponding to this case is shown in Figure 4–26(b). Notice that the system involves two inputs.  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–4–1.

For $t<0$ the system is at tate $Q_{i}=0.015\\;\\mathrm{m}^{3}/\\mathrm{sec})$ . At $t\\,=\\,0$ the inflow valve is closed and so there is no inflow for $t\\geq0$ 0. Find the time necessary to empty the tank to half the original head. The capacitance Cof the tank is 2 m .  \n\nSolution. When the head is stationary, the inflow rate equals the outflow rate. Thus head $H_{o}$ at $t\\,=\\,0$ is obtained from  \n\n$$\n0.015\\,=\\,0.01\\sqrt{H_{o}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nH_{o}=2.25\\:\\mathrm{m}\n$$  \n\nThe equation for the system for $t>0$ is  \n\n$$\n-C\\,d H=Q\\,d t\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d H}{d t}}=-{\\frac{Q}{C}}={\\frac{-0.01{\\sqrt{H}}}{2}}\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d H}{\\sqrt{H}}=-0.005\\,d t\n$$  \n\nAssume that, at $t=t_{1},H=1.125\\,\\mathrm{m}.$ .

The system seems designed to regulate the flow of fluid from one location to another, possibly for control purposes. However, without additional context or information about the specific application, it's difficult to provide further details on how this system works or what its intended function is. 4–29 (a) Pneumatic pressure system; (b) pressuredifference-versusmass-flow-rate curves.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two curves, labeled as \"Valve 1\" and \"Valve 2,\" which appear to represent pressure versus flow rate relationships for different valves. The graph is set against a white background.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Curves:** The graph displays two smooth curves, each representing the relationship between pressure and flow rate for Valve 1 and Valve 2.\n*   **Labels:** The x-axis is labeled as \"q (kg/sec)\" and the y-axis is labeled as \"\\Delta p (N/m^2)\". Additionally, there are labels on both sides of the graph indicating the units: \"(b)\" at the bottom and \"Valve 1\" and \"Valve 2\" near the top.\n*   **Values:** The graph shows various points marked with small lines or dashes across each curve. These marks do not appear to correspond to specific values but rather serve to illustrate the curves' shape and behavior.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nGiven the context of valves and their typical applications in fluid dynamics, it is reasonable to infer that this graph illustrates how different valves affect the pressure-flow relationship in a system. The presence of both \"Valve 1\" and \"Valve 2\" suggests a comparison or analysis between these two types of valves.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a graph comparing the performance characteristics (pressure vs. flow rate) of two different valve configurations. This visual representation allows for an easy comparison of how each valve impacts the system's dynamics under varying conditions.  \n\nDefining the displacement of the midpoint of the rod that connects two bellows as $x$ , find the transfer function $X(s)/P_{i}(s)$ .Assume that the expansion process is isothermal and that the temperature of the entire system stays at $30^{\\circ}\\mathbf{C}.$ Assume also that the polytropic exponent $n$ is $1$ .  \n\nSolution.

The chart is divided into several sections, each representing a different step in the estimation process.\n\n*   **Step 1: Data Preparation**\n    *   The first step involves preparing the data by collecting and organizing it into a suitable format.\n    *   This includes cleaning and preprocessing the data to remove any errors or inconsistencies.\n    *   The resulting dataset is then used as input for the next step in the estimation process.\n*   **Step 2: Model Selection**\n    *   In this step, a suitable model is selected based on the characteristics of the data.\n    *   The chosen model must be able to accurately capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.\n    *   Commonly used models include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), naive Bayes, gradient boosting machines, and neural networks.\n*   **Step 3: Parameter Estimation**\n    *   Once the model has been selected, the next step is to estimate its parameters using the prepared dataset.\n    *   This involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the observed data and the predicted values.\n    *   Commonly used techniques for parameter estimation include maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), method of moments, least squares, and generalized linear models.\n*   **Step 4: Model Evaluation**\n    *   After estimating the model's parameters, it is essential to evaluate its performance using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-squared), cross-validation, and confusion matrix for classification problems.\n    *   These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the curve (AUC), and lift chart.\n*   **Step 5: Model Selection and Validation**\n    *   Based on the evaluation results, a new model can be selected or refined to improve its performance.\n    *   This process is repeated until an optimal model is obtained that meets the required standards of accuracy and precision.\n    *   Cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, holdout method, walk-forward optimization, and rolling window are used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nIn summary, determining the MLE involves a series of steps including data preparation, model selection, parameter estimation, model evaluation, and model validation. By following these steps, it is possible to develop an accurate and reliable estimator for the given dataset. 4–31 (a) Block diagram of the pneumatic controller shown in Figure 4–30; (b) simplified block diagram.  \n\nThus the controller shown in Figure 4–30 is a proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative one.  \n\nIf the resistance $R_{d}$ is removed, or $R_{d}=0$ , the action becomes that of a proportional-plusintegral controller.  \n\nFigure 4–32   \n(a) Overlapped spool valve;   \n(b) underlapped   \nspool valve.  \n\nThe image depicts a diagram of an orifice meter, which is a device used to measure the flow rate of fluids. The diagram shows two pipes, one with a smaller cross-sectional area than the other, and arrows indicating the direction of fluid flow.\n\n*   **Pipe 1:**\n    *   Has a larger cross-sectional area\n    *   Fluid enters from the left side\n    *   Arrows indicate fluid flowing out of the pipe at a higher velocity due to lower pressure\n*   **Pipe 2:**\n    *   Has a smaller cross-sectional area\n    *   Fluid exits into Pipe 1\n    *   Arrows indicate fluid flowing into Pipe 1 at a lower velocity due to higher pressure\n\nThe diagram illustrates how an orifice meter works by creating a restriction in the flow path, causing the fluid to accelerate and decelerate as it passes through. This acceleration and deceleration result in a change in pressure, which can be measured to determine the flow rate of the fluid.\n\n**Answer:** The image shows a diagram of an orifice meter used to measure the flow rate of fluids by creating a restriction in the flow path that causes changes in velocity and pressure.  \n\nThe image depicts a diagram of fluid flow through a pipe, with arrows indicating the direction of flow. The diagram is divided into two sections: \"High pressure\" and \"Low pressure.\" \n\n*   The left side of the diagram shows a section of pipe labeled \"High pressure,\" where the fluid is entering the pipe from the left.\n*   The right side of the diagram shows another section of pipe labeled \"Low pressure,\" where the fluid is exiting the pipe to the right.\n*   In between these two sections, there is a small rectangular shape representing a valve or obstruction in the pipe. This obstruction causes the fluid to change direction and flow from high pressure to low pressure.\n*   The arrows on either side of the diagram indicate the direction of fluid flow through the pipe.\n*   The overall effect of this setup is that the fluid flows from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure, with the valve or obstruction controlling the rate at which this occurs.\n\nThis image illustrates how a valve can be used to control the flow of fluids in a system by creating areas of different pressures.  \n\nIf the resistance $R_{i}$ is removed, or $R_{i}=0$ , the action becomes that of a narrow-band proportional, or two-position, controller. (Note that the actions of two feedback bellows cancel each other, and there is no feedback.)  \n\nA–4–6. Actual spool valves are either overlapped or underlapped because of manufacturing tolerances. Consider the overlapped and underlapped spool valves shown in Figures 4–32(a) and (b). Sketch curves relating the uncovered port area $A$ versus displacement $x$ .  \n\nSolution. For the overlapped valve,a dead zone exists between $-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}x_{0}$ and $\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}x_{0}$ ,or $-{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}x_{0}<x<{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}x_{0}$ .The curve for uncovered port area $A$ versus displacement $x$ is shown in Figure 4–33(a). Such an overlapped valve is unfit as a control valve.  \n\nFor the underlapped valve, the curve for port area $A$ versus displacement $x$ is shown in Figure 4–33(b). The effective curve for the underlapped region has a higher slope, meaning a higher sensitivity. Valves used for controls are usually underlapped.  \n\nA–4–7. Figure 4–34 shows a hydraulic jet-pipe controller. Hydraulic fluid is ejected from the jet pipe. If the jet pipe is shifted to the right from the neutral position, the power piston moves to the left, and vice versa. The jet-pipe valve is not used as much as the flapper valve because of large null flow, slower response, and rather unpredictable characteristics. Its main advantage lies in its insensitivity to dirty fluids.  \n\nSuppose that the power piston is connected to a light load so that the inertia force of the load element is negligible compared to the hydraulic force developed by the power piston.What type of control action does this controller produce?  \n\nSolution. Define the displacement of the jet nozzle from the neutral position as $x$ and the displacement of the power piston as $y.$ If the jet nozzle is moved to the right by a small displace  \n\n# Figure 4–33  \n\n(a) Uncovered-portarea- $A$ -versus  \ndisplacement$^{x}$ curve for the overlapped   \nvalve; (b) uncoveredport-area$A$ -versusdisplacement$^{x}$ curve for the underlapped valve.

The diagram is divided into two sections, labeled (a) and (b), each depicting a different aspect of the concept.\n\n*   **Section (a):**\n    *   This section shows a graph with an x-axis and y-axis.\n    *   There are two lines on the graph: one is horizontal and the other is diagonal.\n    *   The horizontal line represents the effective area, while the diagonal line represents the low-pressure area.\n    *   The intersection point of these two lines is marked as \"A\".\n*   **Section (b):**\n    *   This section also shows a graph with an x-axis and y-axis.\n    *   There are three lines on the graph: one is horizontal, one is diagonal, and the third is inclined at 45 degrees.\n    *   The horizontal line represents the effective area, while the diagonal line represents the low-pressure area.\n    *   The inclined line represents the area exposed to high pressure.\n    *   The intersection point of these three lines is marked as \"B\".\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates the concept of effective area and low-pressure areas using graphs with x-axes and y-axes. It highlights the importance of considering both the effective area and the low-pressure area when evaluating the performance of a system or process.  \n\nThe image depicts a mechanical device, likely a hydraulic or pneumatic system, with various components and labels. The main points of the image are:\n\n*   **Oil under pressure**: This label indicates that the system is designed to operate using pressurized oil.\n*   **Pump**: A pump is visible at the bottom left of the image, which is responsible for generating pressure in the system.\n*   **Valve**: A valve is located near the top right of the image, which controls the flow of oil through the system.\n*   **Cylinder**: A cylinder is present on the right side of the image, which is likely used to convert the pressurized oil into mechanical motion.\n\nOverall, the image appears to show a simplified representation of a hydraulic or pneumatic system, with key components labeled for clarity.  \n\nment $x$ , the oil flows to the right side of the power piston, and the oil in the left side of the power piston is returned to the drain.The oil flowing into the power cylinder is at high pressure; the oil flowing out from the power cylinder into the drain is at low pressure. The resulting pressure difference causes the power piston to move to the left.  \n\nFor a small jet-nozzle displacement $x$ , the flow rate $q$ to the power cylinder is proportional to $x$ ; that is,  \n\n$$\nq\\,=\\,K_{1}x\n$$  \n\nFor the power cylinder,  \n\n$$\nA\\rho\\,d y\\,=\\,q\\,d t\n$$  \n\nwhere $A$ is the power-piston area and $\\rho$ is the density of oil.

If the engine speed increases, the sleeve of the fly-ball governor moves upward. This movement acts as the input to the hydraulic controller.A positive error signal (upward motion of the sleeve) causes the power piston to move downward, reduces the fuel-valve opening, and decreases the engine speed.A block diagram for the system is shown in Figure 4–36.

It is labeled as \"H\" and has an arrow pointing towards it, indicating the direction of flow.\n*   **Outlet**: The outlet represents the point where the cold fluid exits the heat exchanger. It is also labeled with an arrow pointing away from it, indicating the direction of flow.\n*   **Heater**: The heater is a component within the heat exchanger that heats up the incoming hot fluid. It is represented by a zigzag line and is labeled as \"Heater\".\n*   **Fluids**: There are two fluids involved in this process: the hot fluid (H) and the cold fluid (C). The hot fluid enters the inlet, passes through the heater, and exits at the outlet. Meanwhile, the cold fluid enters at the opposite end of the heat exchanger and exits after passing through the heater.\n*   **Flow Direction**: The arrows indicate the direction of flow for both fluids.

The valve consists of several key components, including:\n\n1.  **Inlet Port (P_s)**: This is where compressed air enters the system.\n2.  **Outlet Port (P_b)**: This is where the pressurized air exits the system and performs a task, such as controlling the flow rate or pressure in another process.\n3.  **Valve Spool (k)**: The valve spool is the moving part within the valve that controls the flow of compressed air. It has three positions: centered, left extreme, and right extreme position.\n4.  **Control Pressure (P_c)**: This refers to the pressure used to actuate the proportional valve.\n5.  **Valve Control Signal**: This represents the signal from an electronic controller that drives the proportional valve's operation.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   The control pressure is applied to one side of the valve spool, while the other side receives compressed air from the inlet port.\n*   When the control pressure exceeds a certain threshold, the valve shifts into its left extreme position, allowing compressed air to pass through and perform the desired task.\n*   Conversely, when the control pressure decreases below the threshold, the valve returns to its centered or right extreme position, blocking the flow of compressed air.\n\n**Applications**\n\nThis type of proportional valve is commonly used in various industrial applications, including:\n\n*   **Process Control**: In chemical processing plants, these valves are used to regulate the flow rate and pressure of chemicals being transported.\n*   **Pneumatic Systems**: They are also employed in pneumatic systems, where compressed air is utilized for powering tools, conveying materials, or controlling the movement of machines.\n*   **Automotive Industry**: Proportional valves play a critical role in modern automotive systems, particularly in the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.\n\n**Advantages**\n\nThe electro-pneumatic proportional valve offers several advantages over traditional on/off valves, including:\n\n*   **Improved Accuracy**: The valve provides precise control over the flow rate and pressure of compressed air.\n*   **Increased Efficiency**: By allowing for continuous adjustment of the valve's position, it reduces energy consumption and minimizes wear on the system components.\n*   **Enhanced Safety**: The proportional valve enables more accurate control over critical processes, thereby reducing the risk of accidents or equipment damage.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the electro-pneumatic proportional valve is a highly versatile component that plays a vital role in industrial automation and process control. Its ability to provide precise control over compressed air flow rates and pressures makes it an essential tool for optimizing system performance while ensuring safety and efficiency.  \n\nFigure 4–46 Pneumatic controller.  \n\nB–4–6.

It uses sensors and actuators to regulate the airflow based on input signals from various sources such as temperature, pressure, or flow rate.\n*   **Valves**: Valves are used to control the flow of air into or out of a system. They can be opened or closed manually or automatically by an actuator.\n*   **Sensors**: Sensors detect changes in the system's conditions and send signals to the controller. Examples include pressure sensors, temperature sensors, and flow rate sensors.\n*   **Actuators**: Actuators receive signals from the controller and adjust the valves accordingly.

The controller receives input signals from various sources and adjusts the valves to achieve the desired airflow based on those inputs.  \n\nB–4–8. Figure 4–49 shows a flapper valve. It is placed between two opposing nozzles.If the flapper is moved slightly to the right, the pressure unbalance occurs in the nozzles and the power piston moves to the left, and vice versa. Such a device is frequently used in hydraulic servos as the firststage valve in two-stage servovalves. This usage occurs because considerable force may be needed to stroke larger spool valves that result from the steady-state flow force.To reduce or compensate this force, two-stage valve configuration is often employed; a flapper valve or jet pipe is used as the first-stage valve to provide a necessary force to stroke the second-stage spool valve.  \n\nThe image depicts a technical diagram of a mechanical device, likely used to illustrate the operation and components of a specific machine or system.

Once such a model is obtained, various methods are available for the analysis of system performance.  \n\nIn practice, the input signal to a control system is not known ahead of time but is random in nature, and the instantaneous input cannot be expressed analytically. Only in some special cases is the input signal known in advance and expressible analytically or by curves, such as in the case of the automatic control of cutting tools.  \n\nIn analyzing and designing control systems, we must have a basis of comparison of performance of various control systems.This basis may be set up by specifying particular test input signals and by comparing the responses of various systems to these input signals.  \n\nMany design criteria are based on the response to such test signals or on the response of systems to changes in initial conditions (without any test signals).The use of test signals can be justified because of a correlation existing between the response characteristics of a system to a typical test input signal and the capability of the system to cope with actual input signals.  \n\nTypical Test Signals. The commonly used test input signals are step functions, ramp functions, acceleration functions, impulse functions, sinusoidal functions, and white noise. In this chapter we use test signals such as step, ramp, acceleration and impulse signals.With these test signals, mathematical and experimental analyses of control systems can be carried out easily, since the signals are very simple functions of time.  \n\nWhich of these typical input signals to use for analyzing system characteristics may be determined by the form of the input that the system will be subjected to most frequently under normal operation. If the inputs to a control system are gradually changing functions of time, then a ramp function of time may be a good test signal. Similarly, if a system is subjected to sudden disturbances, a step function of time may be a good test signal; and for a system subjected to shock inputs, an impulse function may be best. Once a control system is designed on the basis of test signals, the performance of the system in response to actual inputs is generally satisfactory. The use of such test signals enables one to compare the performance of many systems on the same basis.  \n\nTransient Response and Steady-State Response. The time response of a control system consists of two parts:the transient response and the steady-state response. By transient response, we mean that which goes from the initial state to the final state. By steady-state response, we mean the manner in which the system output behaves as $t$ approaches infinity.Thus the system response $c(t)$ may be written as  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,c_{\\mathrm{{tr}}}(t)\\,+\\,c_{\\mathrm{{ss}}}(t)\n$$  \n\nwhere the first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the transient response and the second term is the steady-state response.  \n\nAbsolute Stability, Relative Stability, and Steady-State Error. In designing a control system, we must be able to predict the dynamic behavior of the system from a knowledge of the components. The most important characteristic of the dynamic behavior of a control system is absolute stability—that is,whether the system is stable or unstable.A control system is in equilibrium if,in the absence of any disturbance or input, the output stays in the same state.A linear time-invariant control system is stable if the output eventually comes back to its equilibrium state when the system is subjected to an initial condition. A linear time-invariant control system is critically stable if oscillations of the output continue forever. It is unstable if the output diverges without bound from its equilibrium state when the system is subjected to an initial condition.Actually, the output of a physical system may increase to a certain extent but may be limited by mechanical “stops,” or the system may break down or become nonlinear after the output exceeds a certain magnitude so that the linear differential equations no longer apply.  \n\nImportant system behavior (other than absolute stability) to which we must give careful consideration includes relative stability and steady-state error. Since a physical control system involves energy storage, the output of the system, when subjected to an input, cannot follow the input immediately but exhibits a transient response before a steady state can be reached. The transient response of a practical control system often exhibits damped oscillations before reaching a steady state. If the output of a system at steady state does not exactly agree with the input, the system is said to have steadystate error.This error is indicative of the accuracy of the system. In analyzing a control system, we must examine transient-response behavior and steady-state behavior.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. This chapter is concerned with system responses to aperiodic signals (such as step, ramp, acceleration, and impulse functions of time). The outline of the chapter is as follows: Section 5–1 has presented introductory material for the chapter. Section 5–2 treats the response of first-order systems to aperiodic inputs. Section 5–3 deals with the transient response of the second-order systems. Detailed analyses of the step response, ramp response, and impulse response of the second-order systems are presented. Section 5–4 discusses the transient-response analysis of higherorder systems.Section 5–5 gives an introduction to the MATLAB approach to the solution of transient-response problems. Section 5–6 gives an example of a transient-response problem solved with MATLAB. Section 5–7 presents Routh’s stability criterion. Section 5–8 discusses effects of integral and derivative control actions on system performance. Finally, Section 5–9 treats steady-state errors in unity-feedback control systems.  \n\n# 5–2 FIRST-ORDER SYSTEMS  \n\nConsider the first-order system shown in Figure 5–1(a). Physically, this system may represent an $R C$ circuit, thermal system, or the like.A simplified block diagram is shown in Figure 5–1(b).The input-output relationship is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{1}{T s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nIn the following, we shall analyze the system responses to such inputs as the unit-step, unit-ramp, and unit-impulse functions.The initial conditions are assumed to be zero.  \n\nNote that all systems having the same transfer function will exhibit the same output in response to the same input. For any given physical system, the mathematical response can be given a physical interpretation.  \n\nUnit-Step Response of First-Order Systems. Since the Laplace transform of the unit-step function is $1/s$ , substituting $R(s)\\,=\\,1/s$ into Equation (5–1), we obtain  \n\n$$\nC(s)=\\frac{1}{T s\\,+\\,1\\,\\d s}\\frac{1}{s}\n$$  \n\nExpanding $C(s)$ into partial fractions gives  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,={\\frac{1}{s}}\\,-\\,{\\frac{T}{T s\\,+\\,1}}={\\frac{1}{s}}\\,-\\,{\\frac{1}{s\\,+\\,(1/T)}}\n$$  \n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–2), we obtain  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-t/T},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\geq\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe image presents two block diagrams, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to represent a system or process. The diagrams are constructed using a combination of blocks, arrows, and mathematical symbols.\n\n**Block Diagram (a)**\n\n*   **Input Block**: On the left side of the diagram, there is an input block labeled \"R(s)\" with an arrow pointing to it from the top-left corner.\n    *   This block likely represents the input signal or variable being processed by the system.\n*   **Summing Junction**: Below the input block, there is a summing junction symbol (+) indicating that multiple signals are combined at this point.\n    *   The summing junction is typically used in control systems to combine different signals before processing them further.\n*   **Transfer Function Block**: To the right of the summing junction, there is a transfer function block labeled \"1/Ts\".\n    *   This block represents a mathematical operation or transformation applied to the combined signal from the summing junction.\n*   **Output Block**: On the far right side of the diagram, there is an output block labeled \"C(s)\" with an arrow pointing away from it to the bottom-right corner.\n    *   This block likely represents the output signal or variable resulting from the processing performed by the system.\n\n**Block Diagram (b)**\n\n*   **Input Block**: On the left side of the diagram, there is an input block labeled \"R(s)\" with an arrow pointing to it from the top-left corner.\n    *   Similar to Block Diagram (a), this block represents the input signal or variable being processed by the system.\n*   **Transfer Function Block**: To the right of the input block, there is a transfer function block labeled \"1/Ts + 1\".\n    *   This block represents another mathematical operation or transformation applied to the input signal.\n*   **Output Block**: On the far right side of the diagram, there is an output block labeled \"C(s)\" with an arrow pointing away from it to the bottom-right corner.\n    *   Similar to Block Diagram (a), this block likely represents the output signal or variable resulting from the processing performed by the system.\n\nIn summary, both block diagrams appear to represent a simple control system or signal processing chain. The key components of these systems include input blocks for receiving the input signal, summing junctions for combining signals, transfer function blocks for applying mathematical operations, and output blocks for providing the processed output signal. 5–1 (a) Block diagram of a first-order system; (b) simplified block diagram.  \n\nEquation (5–3) states that initially the output $c(t)$ is zero and finally it becomes unity. One important characteristic of such an exponential response curve $c(t)$ is that at $t\\,=\\,T$ the value of $c(t)$ is 0.632, or the response $c(t)$ has reached $63.2\\%$ of its total change.This may be easily seen by substituting $t\\,=\\,T$ in $c(t)$ .That is,  \n\n$$\nc(T)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-1}\\,=\\,0.632\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a black line on a white background, accompanied by several mathematical equations and labels. The graph features a curved line that starts at the origin (0, 0) and increases as it moves to the right.\n\n*   **Graph**\n    *   The graph is a single curved line that begins at the origin (0, 0).\n    *   It has no visible gridlines or axes.\n    *   The curve appears to be concave up, indicating a positive rate of change.\n*   **Mathematical Equations and Labels**\n    *   Several mathematical equations are written in black text around the graph.\n    *   These include:\n        *   \"Slope = 1/T\"\n        *   \"c(t) = 1 - e^(-(t/T))\"\n        *   \"A = 0.632\" (with an arrow pointing to a point on the curve)\n        *   \"B = 86.5%\" (with an arrow pointing to another point on the curve)\n    *   The equations and labels provide context for understanding the graph, but their exact meaning is not clear without additional information.\n*   **Background**\n    *   The background of the image is solid white.\n    *   There are no other visual elements or features present in the image.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a single curved line on a white background, accompanied by several mathematical equations and labels. While the graph itself does not provide any specific information about its meaning or context, the equations and labels suggest that it may be related to some kind of growth or decay process. However, without further clarification, it is difficult to determine what exactly the graph represents. 5–2 Exponential response curve.  \n\nNote that the smaller the time constant $T$ , the faster the system response. Another important characteristic of the exponential response curve is that the slope of the tangent line at $t\\,=\\,0$ is $1/T$ , since  \n\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d c}{d t}\\right|_{t=0}=\\frac{1}{T}\\,e^{-t/T}\\,\\bigg|_{t=0}=\\frac{1}{T}\n$$  \n\nThe output would reach the final value at $t\\,=\\,T$ if it maintained its initial speed of response.From Equation (5–4) we see that the slope of the response curve $c(t)$ decreases monotonically from $1/T$ at $t\\,=\\,0$ to zero at $t\\,=\\infty$ .  \n\nThe exponential response curve $c(t)$ given by Equation (5–3) is shown in Figure 5–2. In one time constant,the exponential response curve has gone from 0 to $63.2\\%$ of the final value.In two time constants,the response reaches $86.5\\%$ of the final value.At $t\\,=\\,3T,4T_{\\mathrm{{c}}}$ ,and $5T$ , the response reaches $95\\%$ ,$98.2\\%$ , and $99.3\\%$ , respectively, of the final value.Thus, for $t\\geq4T$ , the response remains within $2\\%$ of the final value. As seen from Equation (5–3), the steady state is reached mathematically only after an infinite time. In practice, however, a reasonable estimate of the response time is the length of time the response curve needs to reach and stay within the $2\\%$ line of the final value, or four time constants.  \n\nUnit-Ramp Response of First-Order Systems. Since the Laplace transform of the unit-ramp function is $1/s^{2}$ , we obtain the output of the system of Figure 5–1(a) as  \n\n$$\nC(s)={\\frac{1}{T s\\,+\\,1}}{\\frac{1}{s^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nExpanding $C(s)$ into partial fractions gives  \n\n$$\nC(s)=\\frac{1}{s^{2}}-\\frac{T}{s}+\\frac{T^{2}}{T s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nTaking the inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–5), we obtain  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,t\\,-\\,T\\,+\\,T e^{-t/T},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\geq\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe error signal $e(t)$ is then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{e(t)=r(t)-c(t)}}\\\\ {{\\qquad=T(1-e^{-t/T})}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"t\" and \"r(t)\", which appears to be a representation of time response or input-output behavior. The graph features several lines and curves, including:\n\n*   A straight line labeled \"Steady-state error\"\n*   A curve labeled \"r(t) = t\"\n*   A curve labeled \"c(t)\"\n\nThe x-axis is labeled \"t\" and has values ranging from 0 to T, while the y-axis is labeled \"r(t)\" and has values ranging from 0 to 6T. The graph also includes several annotations and labels, such as:\n\n*   Steady-state error: This line represents the difference between the desired output and the actual output at steady state.\n*   r(t) = t: This curve represents the input signal over time.\n*   c(t): This curve represents the output signal over time.\n\nOverall, the graph appears to be illustrating the relationship between the input and output signals in a system, with a focus on the steady-state behavior. 5–3 Unit-ramp response of the system shown in Figure 5–1(a).  \n\nAs $t$ approaches infinity, $e^{-t/T}$ approaches zero, and thus the error signal $e(t)$ approaches $T$ or  \n\n$$\ne(\\infty)=T\n$$  \n\nThe unit-ramp input and the system output are shown in Figure 5–3. The error in following the unit-ramp input is equal to $T$ for sufficiently large $t,$ .The smaller the time constant $T$ , the smaller the steady-state error in following the ramp input.  \n\nUnit-Impulse Response of First-Order Systems. For the unit-impulse input, $R(s)\\,=\\,1$ and the output of the system of Figure 5–1(a) can be obtained as  \n\n$$\nC(s)={\\frac{1}{T s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–7) gives  \n\n$$\nc(t)={\\frac{1}{T}}\\,e^{-t/T},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\geq0\n$$  \n\nThe response curve given by Equation (5–8) is shown in Figure 5–4.  \n\nThe image presents a graph of a function, specifically the impulse response of an ideal low-pass filter. The graph is displayed on a white background and features a black curve.\n\n*   The x-axis represents time (t), ranging from 0 to T.\n*   The y-axis represents the amplitude of the signal, ranging from 0 to 1.\n*   The curve starts at (0, 0) and increases exponentially until it reaches its maximum value at (T/2, 1).\n*   From there, the curve decreases exponentially back down to (T, 0).\n\nThe equation for this function is:\n\nc(t) = e^(-t/T)\n\nwhere c(t) represents the amplitude of the signal at time t, and T is a constant representing the time constant of the filter.\n\nThis type of filter is commonly used in audio processing applications where it's desirable to remove high-frequency noise while preserving lower frequencies. It's also known as an exponential decay or RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit when implemented in electronics. 5–4 Unit-impulse response of the system shown in Figure 5–1(a).  \n\nAn Important Property of Linear Time-Invariant Systems. In the analysis above, it has been shown that for the unit-ramp input the output $c(t)$ is  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,t\\,-\\,T\\,+\\,T e^{-t/T},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\geq\\,0\n$$  \n\nFor the unit-step input, which is the derivative of unit-ramp input, the output $c(t)$ is  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-t/T},\\qquad\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\geq\\,0\n$$  \n\nFinally, for the unit-impulse input, which is the derivative of unit-step input, the output $c(t)$ is  \n\n$$\nc(t)={\\frac{1}{T}}\\,e^{-t/T},\\qquad\\qquad\\mathrm{~for~}t\\geq0\\qquad[\\mathrm{See~Equation~}(5\\mathrm{-}8).]\n$$  \n\nComparing the system responses to these three inputs clearly indicates that the response to the derivative of an input signal can be obtained by differentiating the response of the system to the original signal. It can also be seen that the response to the integral of the original signal can be obtained by integrating the response of the system to the original signal and by determining the integration constant from the zero-output initial condition.This is a property of linear time-invariant systems. Linear time-varying systems and nonlinear systems do not possess this property.  \n\n# 5–3 SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS  \n\nIn this section, we shall obtain the response of a typical second-order control system to a step input, ramp input, and impulse input. Here we consider a servo system as an example of a second-order system.  \n\nServo System. The servo system shown in Figure 5–5(a) consists of a proportional controller and load elements (inertia and viscous-friction elements). Suppose that we wish to control the output position $c$ in accordance with the input position $r$ .  \n\nThe equation for the load elements is  \n\n$$\nJ{\\ddot{c}}\\,+\\,B{\\dot{c}}\\,=\\,T\n$$  \n\nwhere $T$ is the torque produced by the proportional controller whose gain is $K$ . By taking Laplace transforms of both sides of this last equation, assuming the zero initial conditions, we obtain  \n\n$$\nJ s^{2}C(s)\\,+\\,B s C(s)\\,=\\,T(s)\n$$  \n\nSo the transfer function between $C(s)$ and $T(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{T(s)}}={\\frac{1}{s(J s\\,+\\,B)}}\n$$  \n\nBy using this transfer function, Figure 5–5(a) can be redrawn as in Figure 5–5(b), which can be modified to that shown in Figure 5–5(c).The closed-loop transfer function is then obtained as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,B s\\,+\\,K}=\\frac{K/J}{s^{2}\\,+\\,(B/J)s\\,+\\,(K/J)}\n$$  \n\nSuch a system where the closed-loop transfer function possesses two poles is called a second-order system. (Some second-order systems may involve one or two zeros.)  \n\nThis image appears to depict a complex system of interconnected equations and variables, presented as three separate diagrams. The top diagram features four variables (r, e, K, T), while the middle and bottom diagrams each contain five variables.\n\nEach diagram is labeled with letters representing different variables and values, suggesting that it may be related to mathematical modeling or data analysis. However, without additional context or information about these variables and their relationships, it is not possible to provide a more detailed explanation of what this image represents or how it was created. 5–5 (a) Servo system; (b) block diagram; (c) simplified block diagram.  \n\nStep Response of Second-Order System. The closed-loop transfer function of the system shown in Figure 5–5(c) is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,B s\\,+\\,K}\n$$  \n\nwhich can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{K}{J}}{\\left[s+\\frac{B}{2J}+\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{B}{2J}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{K}{J}}\\right]\\left[s+\\frac{B}{2J}-\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{B}{2J}\\right)^{2}-\\frac{K}{J}}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop poles are complex conjugates if $B^{2}\\mathrm{~-~}4J K\\mathrm{~<~}0$ and they are real if $B^{2}\\mathrm{~-~}4J K\\mathrm{~\\geq~}0.$ . In the transient-response analysis, it is convenient to write  \n\n$$\n\\frac{K}{J}=\\omega_{n}^{2},\\qquad\\frac{B}{J}=2\\zeta\\omega_{n}=2\\sigma\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\sigma$ is called the attenuation ;$\\omega_{n}$ , the undamped natural frequency 1 ; and $\\zeta$ , the damping ratio of the system. The damping ratio $\\zeta$ is the ratio of the actual damping $B$ to the critical damping $B_{c}=2\\sqrt{J K}$ or  \n\n$$\n\\zeta=\\frac{B}{B_{c}}=\\frac{B}{2\\sqrt{J K}}\n$$  \n\nFigure 5–6Second-order system.  \n\nThe image shows a block diagram of a control system. The system has two main components: R(s) and E(s). \n\n*   **R(s)**: This is an input to the system, which represents the reference signal or setpoint that the system aims to track.\n*   **E(s)**: This is the error signal, which is calculated as the difference between the desired output (represented by R(s)) and the actual output of the system. The goal of the control system is to minimize this error signal.\n\nThe error signal E(s) is then fed into a controller represented by the transfer function G(s), whose purpose is to generate an appropriate control action that will drive the system's output towards its desired value.\n\n*   **G(s)**: This is the transfer function of the controller, which determines how the input (E(s)) affects the output. The goal of the controller is to adjust its output in such a way that it minimizes the difference between the desired and actual outputs.\n\nThe controlled plant or process being regulated is represented by H(s), whose output is fed back to the controller as an error signal, ensuring that any deviations from the desired setpoint are corrected accordingly.\n\n*   **H(s)**: This is the transfer function of the plant or process being controlled. It represents how the input (u) affects the system's behavior and output.\n\nThe overall control loop ensures that if there are any discrepancies between the actual and desired outputs, appropriate corrective actions are taken to bring them back into alignment with each other. \n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a basic closed-loop control system consisting of a controller and a controlled plant or process connected in such a manner as to continuously monitor their performance relative to a specified setpoint or reference value while taking active measures to correct any deviations that may arise due to external disturbances or model inaccuracies within these components.  \n\nIn terms of $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_{n}$ , the system shown in Figure 5–5(c) can be modified to that shown in Figure 5–6, and the closed-loop transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ given by Equation (5–9) can be written  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nThis form is called the standard form of the second-order system.  \n\nThe dynamic behavior of the second-order system can then be described in terms of two parameters $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_{n}$ . If $0<\\zeta<1$ , the closed-loop poles are complex conjugates and lie in the left-half $s$ plane. The system is then called underdamped, and the transient response is oscillatory. If $\\zeta=0$ , the transient response does not die out. If $\\zeta=1$ ,the system is called critically damped. Overdamped systems correspond to $\\zeta>1$ .  \n\nWe shall now solve for the response of the system shown in Figure 5–6 to a unit-step input.We shall consider three different cases: the underdamped ($0<\\zeta<1]$ ), critically damped ($\\chi=1$ ), and overdamped ($[\\zeta>1$ )cases.  \n\n(1) Underdamped case ($0<\\zeta<1$ ):In this case, $C(s)/R(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{(s\\:+\\:\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\:+\\:j\\omega_{d})(s\\:+\\:\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\:-\\:j\\omega_{d})}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\omega_{d}\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}$ .The frequency $\\omega_{d}$ is called the damped natural frequency . For a unit-step input, $C(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}^{2}\\right)s}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–11) can be obtained easily if $C(s)$ is written in the following form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle C(s)\\,=\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{s\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\omega_{n}}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}^{2}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\,=\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}}{\\left(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\right)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega_{d}^{2}}-\\frac{\\zeta\\omega_{n}}{\\left(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\right)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega_{d}^{2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nReferring to the Laplace transform table in Appendix A, it can be shown that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}}{\\left(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\right)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega_{d}^{2}}\\bigg]=e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}\\cos\\omega_{d}t}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{\\omega_{d}}{\\left(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\right)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega_{d}^{2}}\\bigg]=e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}\\sin\\omega_{d}t}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence the inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–11) is obtained as  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l r l}&{{\\mathcal{L}}^{-1}{\\bigl[}C(s){\\bigr]}=c(t)}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=1\\,-\\,e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}{\\biggl(}\\cos\\omega_{d}t\\,+\\,{\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}}\\sin\\omega_{d}t{\\biggr)}}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=1\\,-\\,{\\frac{e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}}\\sin\\biggl(\\omega_{d}t\\,+\\,\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}{\\zeta}}\\biggr),}&&{{\\mathrm{for}}\\,t\\geq0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation (5–12), it can be seen that the frequency of transient oscillation is the damped natural frequency $\\omega_{d}$ and thus varies with the damping ratio $\\zeta$ .The error signal for this system is the difference between the input and output and is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle e(t)\\,=\\,r(t)\\,-\\,c(t)}}\\\\ {{\\qquad=\\,e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}\\bigg(\\cos\\omega_{d}t\\,+\\,\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}}\\sin\\omega_{d}t\\bigg),\\quad\\mathrm{~for~}t\\ge0}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis error signal exhibits a damped sinusoidal oscillation. At steady state, or at $t\\,=\\infty$ ,no error exists between the input and output.  \n\nIf the damping ratio $\\zeta$ is equal to zero, the response becomes undamped and oscillations continue indefinitely. The response $c(t)$ for the zero damping case may be obtained by substituting $\\zeta=0$ in Equation (5–12), yielding  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,\\cos\\omega_{n}t,\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\geq\\,0\n$$  \n\nThus, from Equation (5–13), we see that $\\omega_{n}$ represents the undamped natural frequen2 cy of the system.That is, $\\omega_{n}$ is that frequency at which the system output would oscillate if the damping were decreased to zero. If the linear system has any amount of damping, the undamped natural frequency cannot be observed experimentally. The frequency that may be observed is the damped natural frequency $\\omega_{d}$ ,which is equal to $\\omega_{n}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}$ .This frequency is always lower than the undamped natural frequency.An increase in $\\zeta$ would reduce the damped natural frequency $\\omega_{d}$ . If $\\zeta$ is increased beyond unity, the response becomes overdamped and will not oscillate.  \n\n(2) Critically damped case $(\\zeta=1)$ ):If the two poles of $C(s)/R(s)$ are equal,the system is said to be a critically damped one.  \n\nFor a unit-step input, $R(s)\\,=\\,1/s$ and $C(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{\\left(s\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}\\right)^{2}s}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–14) may be found as  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-\\omega_{n}t}\\bigl(1\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}t\\bigr),\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\ge0\n$$  \n\nThis result can also be obtained by letting $\\zeta$ approach unity in Equation (5–12) and by using the following limit:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\zeta\\rightarrow1}\\frac{\\sin\\omega_{d}t}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\zeta\\rightarrow1}\\frac{\\sin\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}t}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}=\\omega_{n}t\n$$  \n\n(3) Overdamped case $(\\zeta>1)$ ):In this case, the two poles of $C(s)/R(s)$ are negative real and unequal. For a unit-step input, $R(s)\\,=\\,1/s$ and $C(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\nC(s)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}\\,-\\,1})(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\,-\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}\\,-\\,1})s}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of Equation (5–16) is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle c(t)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\big(\\zeta+\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\big)}\\,e^{-\\big(\\zeta+\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\big)\\omega_{n}t}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\qquad-\\,\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\big(\\zeta-\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\big)}\\,e^{-\\big(\\zeta-\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}\\big)\\omega_{n}t}}\\\\ {\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,\\frac{\\omega_{n}}{2\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}}\\,\\bigg(\\frac{e^{-s_{1}t}}{s_{1}}-\\frac{e^{-s_{2}t}}{s_{2}}\\bigg),\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\,\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\ge0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $s_{1}=(\\zeta\\,+\\,\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}\\,-\\,1})\\omega_{n}$ and $s_{2}=(\\zeta\\,-\\,\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}\\,-\\,1})\\omega_{n}$ .Thus, the response $c(t)$ includes two decaying exponential terms.  \n\nWhen $\\zeta$ is appreciably greater than unity, one of the two decaying exponentials decreases much faster than the other, so the faster-decaying exponential term (which corresponds to a smaller time constant) may be neglected.That is, if A B$-s_{2}$ is located very much closer to the $j\\omega$ a th $-s_{1}$ which means $\\left|s_{2}\\right|\\ll\\left|s_{1}\\right|.$ , then an approximate solution we may neglect $-s_{1}$ .This is permissible because the effect of $-s_{1}$ on the response is much smaller than that of much faster than the term involving $-s_{2}$ , since the term involving $s_{2}$ . Once the faster-decaying exponential term has 2 $s_{1}$ in Equation (5–17) decays disappeared, the response is similar to that of a first-order system, and $C(s)/R(s)$ may be approximated by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{\\zeta\\omega_{n}-\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}}{s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}-\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}}=\\frac{s_{2}}{s\\,+\\,s_{2}}\n$$  \n\nThis approximate form is a direct consequence of the fact that the initial values and final values of both the original $C(s)/R(s)$ and the approximate one agree with each other.  \n\nWith the approximate transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ , the unit-step response can be obtained as  \n\n$$\nC(s)=\\frac{\\zeta\\omega_{n}-\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}}{\\left(s\\,+\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\,-\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}\\,-\\,1}\\right)\\!s}\n$$  \n\nThe time response $c(t)$ is then  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-(\\zeta-\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1})\\omega_{n}t},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\ge\\,0\n$$  \n\nThis gives an approximate unit-step response when one of the poles of $C(s)/R(s)$ can be neglected.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with multiple lines, each representing a different variable. The graph is titled \"c(t)\" and features a grid pattern in the background.\n\n*   **Title:** c(t)\n    *   The title of the graph is \"c(t)\", which suggests that it represents a function or variable denoted as c(t).\n*   **Grid Pattern:**\n    *   The graph has a grid pattern in the background, with numbers and letters labeled on both axes.\n    *   The x-axis is labeled with Greek letters (ζ) and numbers, while the y-axis is labeled with numbers and fractions.\n*   **Lines:**\n    *   There are multiple lines on the graph, each representing a different variable or function.\n    *   Each line has an arrowhead at one end, indicating the direction of increasing values.\n*   **Labels:**\n    *   The x-axis is labeled with Greek letters (ζ) and numbers, ranging from 0 to 12.\n    *   The y-axis is labeled with numbers and fractions, ranging from -1.2 to 2.0.\n*   **Data Points:**\n    *   There are no data points visible on the graph, suggesting that it may be a theoretical or conceptual representation rather than an actual dataset.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a line graph titled \"c(t)\" with multiple lines representing different variables or functions. The graph features a grid pattern in the background and labels on both axes, but does not display any data points. 5–7 Unit-step response curves of the system shown in Figure 5–6.  \n\nA family of unit-step response curves $c(t)$ with various values of $\\zeta$ is shown in Figure 5–7, where the abscissa is the dimensionless variable $\\omega_{n}t$ . The curves are functions only of $\\zeta$ . These curves are obtained from Equations (5–12), (5–15), and (5–17). The system described by these equations was initially at rest.  \n\nNote that two second-order systems having the same $\\zeta$ but different $\\omega_{n}$ will exhibit the same overshoot and the same oscillatory pattern. Such systems are said to have the same relative stability.  \n\nFrom Figure 5–7, we see that an underdamped system with $\\zeta$ between 0.5 and 0.8 gets close to the final value more rapidly than a critically damped or overdamped system. Among the systems responding without oscillation, a critically damped system exhibits the fastest response.An overdamped system is always sluggish in responding to any inputs.  \n\nIt is important to note that, for second-order systems whose closed-loop transfer functions are different from that given by Equation (5–10), the step-response curves may look quite different from those shown in Figure 5–7.  \n\nDefinitions of Transient-Response Specifications. Frequently, the performance characteristics of a control system are specified in terms of the transient response to a unit-step input, since it is easy to generate and is sufficiently drastic. (If the response to a step input is known,it is mathematically possible to compute the response to any input.)  \n\nThe transient response of a system to a unit-step input depends on the initial conditions. For convenience in comparing transient responses of various systems, it is a common practice to use the standard initial condition that the system is at rest initially with the output and all time derivatives thereof zero. Then the response characteristics of many systems can be easily compared.  \n\nThe transient response of a practical control system often exhibits damped oscillations before reaching steady state. In specifying the transient-response characteristics of a control system to a unit-step input, it is common to specify the following:  \n\n1. Delay time, $t_{d}$   \n2. Rise time, $t_{r}$   \n3. Peak time, $t_{p}$   \n4. Maximum overshoot, $M_{p}$   \n5. Settling time, $t_{s}$  \n\nThese specifications are defined in what follows and are shown graphically in Figure 5–8.  \n\n1. Delay time, $t_{d}$ : The delay time is the time required for the response to reach half the final value the very first time.   \n2. Rise time, $t_{r}$ :The rise time is the time required for the response to rise from $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ ,$5\\%$ to $95\\%$ , or $0\\%$ to $100\\%$ of its final value. For underdamped secondorder systems, the $0\\%$ to $100\\%$ rise time is normally used. For overdamped systems, the $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ rise time is commonly used.   \n3. Peak time, $t_{p}$ :The peak time is the time required for the response to reach the first peak of the overshoot.   \n4. Maximum (percent) overshoot, $M_{p}$ : The maximum overshoot is the maximum peak value of the response curve measured from unity. If the final steady-state value of the response differs from unity, then it is common to use the maximum percent overshoot. It is defined by  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Maximum~percent~overshoot}}={\\frac{c(t_{p})\\,-\\,c(\\infty)}{c(\\infty)}}\\times100\\%\n$$  \n\nThe amount of the maximum (percent) overshoot directly indicates the relative stability of the system.  \n\n5. Settling time, $t_{s}$ : The settling time is the time required for the response curve to reach and stay within a range about the final value of size specified by absolute percentage of the final value (usually $2\\%$ or $5\\%$ ). The settling time is related to the largest time constant of the control system.Which percentage error criterion to use may be determined from the objectives of the system design in question.  \n\nThe time-domain specifications just given are quite important, since most control systems are time-domain systems; that is, they must exhibit acceptable time responses. (This means that, the control system must be modified until the transient response is satisfactory.)  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"t\" and \"c(t)\", which appear to represent time and a variable related to time, respectively. The graph features several lines, including:\n\n*   A curved line that represents a function or relationship between the variables.\n*   A horizontal line that serves as a reference point for evaluating the performance of the system.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Allowable Tolerance:** The graph includes an \"Allowable tolerance\" label, indicating that the system's performance is being evaluated against a specific standard or benchmark.\n*   **Measurement Points:** Several measurement points are marked on the graph, including:\n    *   M_p\n    *   t_d\n    *   t_r\n    *   t_p\n    *   t_s\n\nThese measurement points likely correspond to specific events or milestones in the system's behavior.\n\n**Graph Structure:**\n\n*   The graph has a single axis labeled \"t\" and a secondary axis labeled \"c(t)\".\n*   The graph features a curved line that represents the relationship between the variables.\n*   Several measurement points are marked on the graph, including M_p, t_d, t_r, t_p, and t_s.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe graph appears to be a tool for analyzing and evaluating the performance of a system or process. The inclusion of measurement points and an \"Allowable tolerance\" label suggests that the graph is being used to assess whether the system meets certain standards or benchmarks. 5–8 Unit-step response curve showing $t_{d},t_{r}$ ,$t_{p},M_{p}$ , and $t_{s}$ .  \nChapter 5 /Transient and Steady-State Response Analyses  \n\nNote that not all these specifications necessarily apply to any given case. For example, for an overdamped system, the terms peak time and maximum overshoot do not apply. (For systems that yield steady-state errors for step inputs, this error must be kept within a specified percentage level. Detailed discussions of steady-state errors are postponed until Section 5–8.)  \n\nA Few Comments on Transient-Response Specifications. Except for certain applications where oscillations cannot be tolerated, it is desirable that the transient response be sufficiently fast and be sufficiently damped.Thus, for a desirable transient response of a second-order system, the damping ratio must be between 0.4 and 0.8. Small values of $\\zeta$ (that is, $\\zeta<0.4$ )yield excessive overshoot in the transient response, and a system with a large value of $\\zeta$ (that is, $\\zeta>0.81$ )responds sluggishly.  \n\nWe shall see later that the maximum overshoot and the rise time conflict with each other. In other words, both the maximum overshoot and the rise time cannot be made smaller simultaneously. If one of them is made smaller, the other necessarily becomes larger.  \n\nSecond-Order Systems and Transient-Response Specifications. In the following, we shall obtain the rise time, peak time, maximum overshoot, and settling time of the second-order system given by Equation (5–10).These values will be obtained in terms of $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_{n}$ .The system is assumed to be underdamped.  \n\nRise time $t_{r}$ :Referring to Equation (5–12),we obtain the rise time $t_{r}$ by letting $c(t_{r})=1$  \n\n$$\nc(t_{r})\\,=\\,1\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t_{r}}\\bigg(\\cos\\omega_{d}t_{r}\\,+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}}\\sin\\omega_{d}t_{r}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nSince $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t_{r}}\\neq0$ we obtain from Equation (5–18) the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\cos\\omega_{d}t_{r}\\,+\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}\\sin\\omega_{d}t_{r}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nSince $\\omega_{n}\\,\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}\\,=\\,\\omega_{d}$ and $\\zeta\\omega_{n}=\\sigma$ , we have  \n\n$$\n\\tan\\omega_{d}t_{r}=-\\,{\\frac{\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}}{\\zeta}}=-\\,{\\frac{\\omega_{d}}{\\sigma}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the rise time $t_{r}$ is  \n\n$$\nt_{r}\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{\\omega_{d}}\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{d}}{-\\sigma}\\right)\\,=\\,\\frac{\\pi\\,-\\,\\beta}{\\omega_{d}}\n$$  \n\nwhere angle $\\beta$ is defined in Figure 5–9. Clearly, for a small value of $t_{r},\\omega_{d}$ must be large.  \n\nFigure 5–9   \nDefinition of the angle $\\beta$ .  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical diagram, likely from a textbook or educational resource.

It likely serves as a tool for teaching or learning complex mathematical ideas, such as those found in calculus, linear algebra, or number theory.  \n\nPeak time $t_{p}$ :Referring to Equation (5–12), we may obtain the peak time by differentiating $c(t)$ with respect to time and letting this derivative equal zero.

The presence of numerical values and symbols suggests that the graph is related to a specific mathematical framework or theory, such as control systems, signal processing, or mechanical engineering. Further analysis would be required to fully understand the underlying physics or mathematics behind this graph. 5–10 Pair of envelope curves for the unitstep response curve of the system shown in Figure 5–6.  \n\nThe curves $1\\,\\pm\\,\\big(e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}/\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}\\big)$ A Bare the envelope curves of the transient response to a unit-step input.The response curve $c(t)$ always remains within a pair of the envelope curves, as shown in Figure 5–10.The time constant of these envelope curves is $1/\\zeta\\omega_{n}$ .  \n\nThe speed of decay of the transient response depends on the value of the time constant $1/\\zeta\\omega_{n}$ . For a given $\\omega_{n}$ , the settling time $t_{s}$ is a function of the damping ratio $\\zeta$ . From Figure 5–7,we see that for the same $\\omega_{n}$ and for a range of $\\zeta$ between 0 and 1 the settling time $t_{s}$ for a very lightly damped system is larger than that for a properly damped system.For an overdamped system, the settling time $t_{s}$ becomes large because of the sluggish response.  \n\nThe settling time corresponding to a $\\pm2\\%$ or $\\pm5\\%$ tolerance band may be measured in terms of the time constant $T=1/\\zeta\\omega_{n}$ from the curves of Figure 5–7 for different values of $\\zeta$ .The results are shown in Figure 5–11. For $0<\\zeta<0.9$ , if the $2\\%$ criterion is used, $t_{s}$ is approximately four times the time constant of the system. If the $5\\%$ criterion is used, then $t_{s}$ is approximately three times the time constant. Note that the settling time reaches a minimum value around $\\zeta=0.76$ (for the $2\\%$ criterion) or $\\zeta\\,=\\,0.68$ (for the $5\\%$ criterion) and then increases almost linearly for large values of $\\zeta$ .The discontinuities in the curves of Figure 5–11 arise because an infinitesimal change in the value of $\\zeta$ can cause a finite change in the settling time.  \n\nFor convenience in comparing the responses of systems, we commonly define the settling time $t_{s}$ to be  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{t_{s}=4T={\\frac{4}{\\sigma}}={\\frac{4}{\\zeta\\omega_{n}}}\\quad}}&{{\\left(2\\%{\\mathrm{~criterion}}\\right)}}\\\\ {{\\ }}&{{\\ }}\\\\ {{t_{s}=3T={\\frac{3}{\\sigma}}={\\frac{3}{\\zeta\\omega_{n}}}\\quad}}&{{\\left(5\\%{\\mathrm{~criterion}}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that the settling time is inversely proportional to the product of the damping ratio and the undamped natural frequency of the system. Since the value of $\\zeta$ is usually determined from the requirement of permissible maximum overshoot, the settling time is determined primarily by the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ . This means that the duration of the transient period may be varied, without changing the maximum overshoot, by adjusting the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ .  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"Settling time\" and \"Tolerance band,\" which appears to be related to electronic or mechanical systems. The graph features three distinct lines representing different tolerance bands: 2%, 5%, and an unspecified percentage.\n\n*   **Graph Title**\n    *   The title of the graph is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as \"Settling Time vs. Tolerance Band.\"\n*   **Axes**\n    *   **Y-axis (Settling time):** The y-axis represents settling time, with values ranging from 0 to 6T, where T is likely a unit of time.\n    *   **X-axis (Tolerance band):** The x-axis represents the tolerance band, with values ranging from 0% to approximately 10%.\n*   **Lines**\n    *   **2% Tolerance Band:** A line representing the 2% tolerance band is plotted on the graph. It starts at around 3T on the y-axis and decreases as it approaches the x-axis.\n    *   **5% Tolerance Band:** Another line represents the 5% tolerance band, starting at approximately 4.5T on the y-axis and decreasing towards the x-axis.\n    *   **Unspecified Percentage Tolerance Band:** A third line is present but its percentage value is not explicitly labeled. It starts near the origin (0,0) of the graph and increases as it approaches the right side of the plot.\n*   **Interpretation**\n    *   The graph illustrates how settling time changes with respect to tolerance band for different percentages. The lines suggest that higher tolerance bands result in longer settling times.\n\nIn summary, the graph displays the relationship between settling time and tolerance band for various percentage values, providing a visual representation of how these parameters interact in electronic or mechanical systems. 5–11 Settling time $t_{s}$ versus $\\zeta$ curves.  \n\nFrom the preceding analysis,it is evident that for rapid response $\\omega_{n}$ must be large.To limit the maximum overshoot $M_{p}$ and to make the settling time small,the damping ratio $\\zeta$ should not be too small. The relationship between the maximum percent overshoot $M_{p}$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$ is presented in Figure 5–12. Note that if the damping ratio is between 0.4 and 0.7, then the maximum percent overshoot for step response is between $25\\%$ and $4\\%$ .  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring mathematical equations and graphs.\n\n*   **Top Section:**\n    *   A line graph is displayed on the right side of the top section.\n        *   The y-axis is labeled \"%,\" while the x-axis represents \"z.\"\n        *   The graph features three lines:\n            *   One line begins at 100% and descends to approximately 50% as z approaches zero.\n            *   Another line starts at around 20% and increases to about 80% as z approaches one.\n            *   A third line commences at roughly 10% and rises to approximately 90% as z approaches two.\n    *   To the left of the graph, several equations are provided:\n\n        | Equation                        | Explanation                                                                           |\n        | :-------------------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n        | M_p: Maximum peak amplitude     | Represents the maximum value that a system's output can reach.                        |\n        | C(s)/R(s) = s^2 + 2ζs + 1    | The transfer function of a second-order system, where C is the control input and R is the reference signal. ζ represents the damping ratio. |\n        *   A mathematical equation with variables M_p, zeta (ζ), and s.\n            *   It appears to be related to the transfer function mentioned earlier.\n    *   In the top-right corner of this section, an equation is written:\n\n        | C(s)/R(s) = s^2 + 2ζs + 1       |\n        *   This seems to represent a second-order system in terms of its transfer function.\n\n*   **Bottom Section:**\n    *   A line graph is displayed on the right side of the bottom section.\n        *   The y-axis is labeled \"%,\" while the x-axis represents \"z.\"\n        *   The graph features two lines:\n            *   One line begins at 100% and descends to approximately 50% as z approaches zero.\n            *   Another line starts at around 20% and increases to about 80% as z approaches one.\n\n    In summary, the image presents a collection of mathematical equations and graphs related to systems dynamics. The top section focuses on the relationship between M_p, ζ, and s, while the bottom section explores the behavior of two functions with respect to their input \"z.\" 5–12 $M_{p}$ versus $\\zeta$ curve.  \n\nIt is important to note that the equations for obtaining the rise time, peak time, maximum overshoot, and settling time are valid only for the standard second-order system defined by Equation (5–10). If the second-order system involves a zero or two zeros, the shape of the unit-step response curve will be quite different from those shown in Figure 5–7.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 5–6,where $\\zeta=0.6$ and 2 $\\omega_{n}=5$ rad 'sec.Let us obtain the rise time $t_{r}$ , peak time $t_{p}$ , maximum overshoot $M_{p}$ , and settling time $t_{s}$ when the system is subjected to a unit-step input.  \n\nFrom the given values of $\\zeta$ and $\\omega_{n}$ , we obtain $\\omega_{d}\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}\\,=\\,4$ and $\\sigma\\,=\\,\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\,=\\,3$ .  \n\nRise time $t_{r}$ :The rise time is  \n\n$$\nt_{r}=\\frac{\\pi-\\beta}{\\omega_{d}}=\\frac{3.14\\,-\\,\\beta}{4}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\beta=\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{\\omega_{d}}{\\sigma}}=\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{4}{3}}=0.93\\;\\mathrm{rad}\n$$  \n\nThe rise time $t_{r}$ is thus  \n\n$$\nt_{r}={\\frac{3.14\\,-\\,0.93}{4}}=0.55\\;{\\mathrm{sec}}\n$$  \n\nPeak time $t_{p}$ :The peak time is  \n\n$$\nt_{p}=\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_{d}}=\\frac{3.14}{4}=0.785\\;\\mathrm{sec}\n$$  \n\nMaximum overshoot $M_{p}$ :The maximum overshoot is  \n\n$$\nM_{p}\\,=\\,e^{-(\\sigma/\\omega_{d})\\pi}\\,=\\,e^{-(3/4)\\times3.14}\\,=\\,0.095\n$$  \n\nThe maximum percent overshoot is thus $9.5\\%$ .  \n\nSettling time $t_{s}$ :For the $2\\%$ criterion, the settling time is  \n\n$$\nt_{s}={\\frac{4}{\\sigma}}={\\frac{4}{3}}=1.33\\;\\mathrm{sec}\n$$  \n\nFor the $5\\%$ criterion,  \n\n$$\nt_{s}={\\frac{3}{\\sigma}}={\\frac{3}{3}}=1\\;\\mathrm{sec}\n$$  \n\nServo System with Velocity Feedback. The derivative of the output signal can be used to improve system performance. In obtaining the derivative of the output position signal,it is desirable to use a tachometer instead of physically differentiating the output signal. (Note that the differentiation amplifies noise effects. In fact, if discontinuous noises are present,differentiation amplifies the discontinuous noises more than the useful signal. For example, the output of a potentiometer is a discontinuous voltage signal because, as the potentiometer brush is moving on the windings, voltages are induced in the switchover turns and thus generate transients.The output of the potentiometer therefore should not be followed by a differentiating element.)  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating a mathematical equation, comprising three distinct sections labeled (a), (b), and (c).

The equations and symbols used suggest that it may involve variables such as s, J, B, and K, which could represent time-domain signals, coefficients, or parameters in the system being modeled. However, without additional context or information about the specific application or field of study, it is challenging to provide a more detailed interpretation of the flowchart's purpose and meaning. 5–13 (a) Block diagram of a servo system; (b) simplified block diagram.   \n(b)  \n\nThe tachometer, a special dc generator, is frequently used to measure velocity without differentiation process. The output of a tachometer is proportional to the angular velocity of the motor.  \n\nConsider the servo system shown in Figure 5–13(a). In this device, the velocity signal, together with the positional signal, is fed back to the input to produce the actuating error signal. In any servo system, such a velocity signal can be easily generated by a tachometer.The block diagram shown in Figure 5–13(a) can be simplified, as shown in Figure 5–13(b), giving  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,(B\\,+\\,K K_{h})s\\,+\\,K}\n$$  \n\nComparing Equation (5–24) with Equation (5–9), notice that the velocity feedback has the effect of increasing damping.The damping ratio $\\zeta$ becomes  \n\n$$\n\\zeta=\\frac{B\\,+\\,K K_{h}}{2\\sqrt{K J}}\n$$  \n\nThe undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}\\,=\\,\\sqrt{K/J}$ is not affected by velocity feedback.Noting that the maximum overshoot for a unit-step input can be controlled by controlling the value of the damping ratio $\\zeta$ , we can reduce the maximum overshoot by adjusting the velocity-feedback constant $K_{h}$ so that $\\zeta$ is between 0.4 and 0.7.  \n\nIt is important to remember that velocity feedback has the effect of increasing the damping ratio without affecting the undamped natural frequency of the system.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 5–2  \n\nFor the system shown in Figure 5–13(a), determine the values of gain $K$ and velocity-feedback constant $K_{h}$ so that the maximum overshoot in the unit-step response is 0.2 and the peak time is 1 sec.

For a unit-impulse input $r(t)$ ,the corresponding Laplace transform is unity, or $R(s)\\,=\\,1.$ .The unit-impulse response $C(s)$ of the second-order system shown in Figure 5-6 is  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{n}^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of this equation yields the time solution for the response $c(t)$ as follows:  \n\nFor $0\\leq\\zeta<1$ ,  \n\n$$\nc(t)={\\frac{\\omega_{n}}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}}\\,e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}\\sin\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}\\,t,\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\ge0\n$$  \n\nFor $\\zeta\\,=\\,1$ ,  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}^{2}t e^{-\\omega_{n}t},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\,\\geq\\,0\n$$  \n\nFor $\\zeta>1$ ,  \n\n$$\nc(t)=\\frac{\\omega_{n}}{2\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}}\\,e^{-(\\zeta-\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1})\\omega_{n}t}-\\frac{\\omega_{n}}{2\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1}}\\,e^{-(\\zeta+\\sqrt{\\zeta^{2}-1})\\omega_{n}t},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\,t\\ge0\n$$  \n\nNote that without taking the inverse Laplace transform of $C(s)$ we can also obtain the time response $c(t)$ by differentiating the corresponding unit-step response, since the unit-impulse function is the time derivative of the unit-step function. A family of unit-impulse response curves given by Equations (5–26) and (5–27) with various values of $\\zeta$ is shown in Figure 5–14. The curves $c(t)/\\omega_{n}$ are plotted against the dimensionless variable $\\omega_{n}t$ , and thus they are functions only of $\\zeta$ . For the critically damped and overdamped cases, the unit-impulse response is always positive or zero; that is, $c(t)\\geq0.$ . This can be seen from Equations (5–27) and (5–28). For the underdamped case, the unit-impulse response $c(t)$ oscillates about zero and takes both positive and negative values.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with multiple curves, each representing a different function. The x-axis is labeled \"ωn t\" and ranges from 0 to 12, while the y-axis is labeled \"c(t)/ωn\" and ranges from -1.0 to 1.0.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   Multiple curves are plotted on the graph, each with its own distinct shape and characteristics.\n*   The curves appear to be smooth and continuous, with no visible discontinuities or sharp changes.\n*   The x-axis is labeled \"ωn t\", indicating that it represents a time-dependent variable. The units of measurement for this axis are not specified.\n*   The y-axis is labeled \"c(t)/ωn\", suggesting that it represents a ratio of two quantities, one of which is related to time (\"t\") and the other to frequency (\"ωn\"). Again, the units of measurement for this axis are not specified.\n\n**Visual Observations:**\n\n*   The curves exhibit varying degrees of curvature, with some being more pronounced than others.\n*   Some curves appear to intersect or cross over each other at certain points along the x-axis.\n*   The overall shape and behavior of the curves suggest that they may be related to oscillatory or periodic phenomena.\n\n**Possible Interpretations:**\n\n*   One possible interpretation is that the graph represents a family of transfer functions or frequency responses for a system, with each curve corresponding to a different parameter or setting.\n*   Another possibility is that the graph illustrates the behavior of a physical system over time, such as the response of a mechanical oscillator or electrical circuit to varying inputs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWithout additional context or information about the origin and purpose of the graph, it is difficult to provide a definitive interpretation. However, based on the visual characteristics of the curves and the labels on the axes, it seems likely that the graph represents some kind of mathematical model or simulation related to oscillatory systems or frequency responses. Further analysis and comparison with known models or simulations would be necessary to determine the specific meaning and significance of this graph. 5–14 Unit-impulse response curves of the system shown in Figure 5–6.   \nChapter 5 /Transient and Steady-State Response Analyses  \n\nThe image presents a graph illustrating the relationship between time (t) and unit-impulse response, with the x-axis representing time (t) and the y-axis representing the unit-impulse response. The graph features two distinct curves: one for the unit-impulse response and another for the unit-step function.\n\n**Unit-Impulse Response Curve**\n\n*   The unit-impulse response curve is represented by a continuous, smooth line that starts at zero on the y-axis.\n*   It initially increases gradually before reaching its maximum value at approximately 1.5 units on the x-axis.\n*   The curve then decreases sharply, crossing the x-axis and becoming negative, before eventually returning to zero.\n\n**Unit-Step Function Curve**\n\n*   The unit-step function curve is depicted as a step-like graph with a flat section representing the steady-state response of the system.\n*   The curve starts at zero on the y-axis and remains constant until it reaches its peak value at approximately 1.5 units on the x-axis.\n*   Beyond this point, the curve begins to decrease gradually, eventually returning to zero.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   **Time Axis (t):** The x-axis represents time (t), ranging from 0 to an unspecified upper limit.\n*   **Unit-Impulse Response:** The y-axis represents the unit-impulse response, which is a measure of how a system responds to an impulse input. The axis ranges from -1 to 1.\n*   **Unit-Step Function:** The graph also includes a unit-step function curve, which illustrates the steady-state response of the system to a constant input.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the image provides a visual representation of the relationship between time and unit-impulse response, as well as the corresponding unit-step function. The graph effectively conveys the behavior of a system in response to different types of inputs, making it a useful tool for understanding and analyzing dynamic systems. 5–15 Unit-impulse response curve of the system shown in Figure 5–6.  \n\nFrom the foregoing analysis, we may conclude that if the impulse response $c(t)$ does not change sign, the system is either critically damped or overdamped, in which case the corresponding step response does not overshoot but increases or decreases monotonically and approaches a constant value.  \n\nThe maximum overshoot for the unit-impulse response of the underdamped system occurs at  \n\n$$\nt={\\frac{\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}{\\zeta}}}{\\omega_{n}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}}},\\qquad{\\mathrm{where~}}0<\\zeta<1\n$$  \n\n[Equation (5–29) can be obtained by equating $d c/d t$ to zero and solving for $t$ .] The maximum overshoot is  \n\n$$\nc(t)_{\\mathrm{max}}=\\,\\omega_{n}\\mathrm{exp}\\biggl(-\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}\\tan^{-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}{\\zeta}\\biggr),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{where}\\,\\,0<\\zeta<1\n$$  \n\n[Equation (5–30) can be obtained by substituting Equation (5–29) into Equation (5–26).]  \n\nSince the unit-impulse response function is the time derivative of the unit-step response function, the maximum overshoot $M_{p}$ for the unit-step response can be found from the corresponding unit-impulse response.That is, the area under the unitimpulse response curve from $t\\,=\\,0$ to the time of the first zero, as shown in Figure 5–15, is $1\\,+\\,M_{p}$ , where $M_{p}$ is the maximum overshoot (for the unit-step response) given by Equation (5–21). The peak time $t_{p}$ (for the unit-step response) given by Equation (5–20) corresponds to the time that the unit-impulse response first crosses the time axis.  \n\n# 5–4 HIGHER-ORDER SYSTEMS  \n\nIn this section we shall present a transient-response analysis of higher-order systems in general terms. It will be seen that the response of a higher-order system is the sum of the responses of first-order and second-order systems.  \n\n# Transient Response of Higher-Order Systems. Consider the system shown in Figure 5–16.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nIn general, $G(s)$ and $H(s)$ are given as ratios of polynomials in $s$ , or  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{p(s)}{q(s)}\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad H(s)=\\frac{n(s)}{d(s)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $p(s),q(s),n(s)$ , and $d(s)$ are polynomials in $s$ .The closed-loop transfer function given by Equation (5–31) may then be written  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{p(s)d(s)}{q(s)d(s)\\,+\\,p(s)n(s)}}}\\\\ &{}&{=\\frac{b_{0}s^{m}\\,+\\,b_{1}s^{m-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,b_{m-1}s\\,+\\,b_{m}}{a_{0}s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}}}&{\\,\\,(m\\leq n)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe transient response of this system to any given input can be obtained by a computer simulation. (See Section 5–5.) If an analytical expression for the transient response is desired, then it is necessary to factor the denominator polynomial. [MATLAB may be used for finding the roots of the denominator polynomial. Use the command roots(den) .] Once the numerator and the denominator have been factored, $C(s)/R(s)$ can be written in the form  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,z_{1})(s\\,+\\,z_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,z_{m})}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})}}\n$$  \n\nLet us examine the response behavior of this system to a unit-step input. Consider first the case where the closed-loop poles are all real and distinct. For a unit-step input, Equation (5–32) can be written  \n\n$$\nC(s)={\\frac{a}{s}}+\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\,{\\frac{a_{i}}{s\\,+\\,p_{i}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{i}$ is the residue of the pole at $s\\,=\\,-p_{i}$ . (If the system involves multiple poles, then $C(s)$ will have multiple-pole terms.) [The partial-fraction expansion of $C(s)$ , as given by Equation (5–33), can be obtained easily with MATLAB. Use the residue command. (See Appendix B.)]  \n\nIf all closed-loop poles lie in the left-half $s$ plane, the relative magnitudes of the residues determine the relative importance of the components in the expanded form of $C(s)$ . If there is a closed-loop zero close to a closed-loop pole, then the residue at this pole is small and the coefficient of the transient-response term corresponding to this pole becomes small. A pair of closely located poles and zeros will effectively cancel each other. If a pole is located very far from the origin, the residue at this pole may be small. The transients corresponding to such a remote pole are small and last a short time.Terms in the expanded form of $C(s)$ having very small residues contribute little to the transient response, and these terms may be neglected. If this is done, the higher-order system may be approximated by a lower-order one. (Such an approximation often enables us to estimate the response characteristics of a higher-order system from those of a simplified one.)  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the components and their interconnections that make up a control system. The diagram shows the flow of signals through the system.\n\n*   **Input**: The input signal to the system is represented by the variable R(s), which is an arrow pointing into the system.\n*   **Controller (G(s))**: The controller is represented by the block labeled G(s). This block processes the input signal and produces a control output.\n*   **Plant (H(s))**: The plant is represented by the block labeled H(s). This block represents the physical system being controlled, such as a motor or a process.\n*   **Output**: The output of the system is represented by the variable C(s), which is an arrow pointing out of the system.\n\nThe diagram also shows the feedback loop, which is a critical component of control systems. The feedback loop allows the controller to monitor the output of the plant and adjust its input accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram represents a basic control system with an input signal, a controller, a plant, and an output signal, along with a feedback loop that enables the controller to regulate the plant's behavior. 5–16 Control system.  \n\ncomplex-conjugate poles.A pair of complex-conjugate poles yields a second-order term Next, consider the case where the poles of $C(s)$ consist of real poles and pairs of 2 in s. Since the factored form of the higher-order characteristic equation consists of firstand second-order terms, Equation (5–33) can be rewritten  \n\n$$\nC(s)={\\frac{a}{s}}+\\ \\sum_{j=1}^{q}\\,{\\frac{a_{j}}{s\\ +\\ p_{j}}}+\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{r}{\\frac{b_{k}\\bigl(s+\\zeta_{k}\\omega_{k}\\bigr)\\ +\\ c_{k}\\omega_{k}\\sqrt{1\\ -\\ \\zeta_{k}^{2}}}{s^{2}\\ +\\ 2\\zeta_{k}\\omega_{k}s\\ +\\ \\omega_{k}^{2}}}\\qquad(q\\ +\\ 2r\\ =\\ m)\\,.\n$$  \n\nwhere we assumed all closed-loop poles are distinct. [If the closed-loop poles involve multiple poles, $C(s)$ must have multiple-pole terms.] From this last equation, we see that the response of a higher-order system is composed of a number of terms involving the 2 simple functions found in the responses of first- and second-order systems. The unitstep response $c(t)$ , the inverse Laplace transform of $C(s)$ , is then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{c(t)\\,=\\,a\\,+\\,\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{q}a_{j}e^{-p_{j}t}\\,+\\,\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=1}^{r}b_{k}e^{-\\zeta_{k}\\omega_{k}t}\\cos\\omega_{k}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta_{k}^{2}}t}}&{{}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle+\\,\\sum_{k=1}^{r}c_{k}e^{-\\zeta_{k}\\omega_{k}t}\\sin\\omega_{k}\\sqrt{1-\\zeta_{k}^{2}}t,}}&{{\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\ge0}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus the response curve of a stable higher-order system is the sum of a number of exponential curves and damped sinusoidal curves.  \n\nIf all closed-loop poles lie in the left-half $s$ plane, then the exponential terms and the damped exponential terms in Equation (5–34) will approach zero as time $t$ increases. The steady-state output is then $c(\\infty)\\,=\\,a$ .  \n\nLet us assume that the system considered is a stable one.Then the closed-loop poles that are located far from the $j\\omega$ axis have large negative real parts. The exponential terms that correspond to these poles decay very rapidly to zero. (Note that the horizontal distance from a closed-loop pole to the $j\\omega$ axis determines the settling time of transients due to that pole.The smaller the distance is, the longer the settling time.)  \n\nRemember that the type of transient response is determined by the closed-loop poles, while the shape of the transient response is primarily determined by the closedloop zeros. As we have seen earlier, the poles of the input $R(s)$ yield the steady-state response terms in the solution, while the poles of $C(s)/R(s)$ enter into the exponential transient-response terms and/or damped sinusoidal transient-response terms.The zeros of $C(s)/R(s)$ do not affect the exponents in the exponential terms, but they do affect the magnitudes and signs of the residues.  \n\nDominant Closed-Loop Poles. The relative dominance of closed-loop poles is determined by the ratio of the real parts of the closed-loop poles, as well as by the relative magnitudes of the residues evaluated at the closed-loop poles.The magnitudes of the residues depend on both the closed-loop poles and zeros.  \n\nIf the ratios of the real parts of the closed-loop poles exceed 5 and there are no zeros nearby, then the closed-loop poles nearest the $j\\omega$ axis will dominate in the transientresponse behavior because these poles correspond to transient-response terms that decay slowly. Those closed-loop poles that have dominant effects on the transientresponse behavior are called dominant closed-loop poles. Quite often the dominant closed-loop poles occur in the form of a complex-conjugate pair.The dominant closedloop poles are most important among all closed-loop poles.  \n\nNote that the gain of a higher-order system is often adjusted so that there will exist a pair of dominant complex-conjugate closed-loop poles.The presence of such poles in a stable system reduces the effects of such nonlinearities as dead zone, backlash, and coulomb-friction.  \n\nStability Analysis in the Complex Plane. The stability of a linear closed-loop system can be determined from the location of the closed-loop poles in the $s$ plane. If any of these poles lie in the right-half $s$ plane, then with increasing time they give rise to the dominant mode, and the transient response increases monotonically or oscillates with increasing amplitude. This represents an unstable system. For such a system, as soon as the power is turned on, the output may increase with time. If no saturation takes place in the system and no mechanical stop is provided, then the system may eventually be subjected to damage and fail, since the response of a real physical system cannot increase indefinitely.Therefore, closed-loop poles in the right-half $s$ plane are not permissible in the usual linear control system. If all closed-loop poles lie to the left of the $j\\omega$ axis, any transient response eventually reaches equilibrium. This represents a stable system.  \n\nWhether a linear system is stable or unstable is a property of the system itself and does not depend on the input or driving function of the system.The poles of the input, or driving function, do not affect the property of stability of the system, but they contribute only to steady-state response terms in the solution.Thus, the problem of absolute stability can be solved readily by choosing no closed-loop poles in the right-half $s$ plane, including the jvaxis. (Mathematically, closed-loop poles on the $j\\omega$ axis will yield oscillations, the amplitude of which is neither decaying nor growing with time. In practical cases, where noise is present, however, the amplitude of oscillations may increase at a rate determined by the noise power level. Therefore, a control system should not have closed-loop poles on the $j\\omega$ axis.)  \n\nNote that the mere fact that all closed-loop poles lie in the left-half $s$ plane does not guarantee satisfactory transient-response characteristics.If dominant complex-conjugate closed-loop poles lie close to the $j\\omega$ axis, the transient response may exhibit excessive oscillations or may be very slow.Therefore,to guarantee fast,yet well-damped,transientresponse characteristics, it is necessary that the closed-loop poles of the system lie in a particular region in the complex plane, such as the region bounded by the shaded area in Figure 5–17.  \n\nSince the relative stability and transient-response performance of a closed-loop control system are directly related to the closed-loop pole-zero configuration in the $s$ plane, it is frequently necessary to adjust one or more system parameters in order to obtain suitable configurations.The effects of varying system parameters on the closed-loop poles will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6.  \n\nThe image is a graph with two axes, x and y, and several lines and curves plotted on it. The purpose of the image appears to be to illustrate some mathematical concept or relationship between different variables.\n\n* A graph with two axes:\n\t+ The x-axis ranges from -5 to 10.\n\t+ The y-axis ranges from -2 to 12.\n* Several lines and curves are plotted on the graph:\n\t+ There is a straight line that passes through the points (0, 0) and (10, 20).\n\t+ There is a curved line that opens upwards and has its vertex at approximately (5, 10).\n\t+ There is another curved line that opens downwards and has its vertex at approximately (-5, -10).\n* The lines and curves appear to be related to each other in some way:\n\t+ The straight line seems to intersect with the curved lines at various points.\n\t+ The curved lines seem to be symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nOverall, the image suggests that there is a mathematical relationship between the variables represented by the x and y axes, but the exact nature of this relationship is not immediately clear. To find out more, we would need additional context or information about what each axis represents and how they are related. 5–17 Region in the complex plane satisfying the conditions $\\zeta>0.4$ and $t_{s}<4/\\sigma$ .  \n\n# 5–5 TRANSIENT-RESPONSE ANALYSIS WITH MATLAB  \n\nIntroduction. The practical procedure for plotting time response curves of systems higher than second order is through computer simulation. In this section we present the computational approach to the transient-response analysis with MATLAB.In particular, we discuss step response,impulse response,ramp response,and responses to other simple inputs.  \n\nMATLAB Representation of Linear Systems. The transfer function of a system is represented by two arrays of numbers. Consider the system  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{2s\\,+\\,25}{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,25}\n$$  \n\nThis system can be represented as two arrays, each containing the coefficients of the polynomials in decreasing powers of $s$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathsf{n u m}=[2\\ \\,25]}\\\\ {\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\ \\ 4\\ \\ 25]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAn alternative representation is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{n u m}=\\left[0\\mathrm{~}2\\mathrm{~}25\\right]}\\\\ {\\mathsf{d e n}=\\left[1\\mathrm{~}4\\mathrm{~}\\,25\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn this expression a zero is padded. Note that if zeros are padded, the dimensions of “num ” vector and “ den ” vector become the same.An advantage of padding zeros is that the “ num ” vector and “ den ” vector can be directly added. For example,  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathsf{n u m+d e n}=[0\\ \\mathrm{~2~}\\ 25]+[1\\ \\mathrm{~4~}\\ 25]}\\\\ {=[1\\ \\mathrm{~6~}\\ 50]}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nIf num and den (the numerator and denominator of the closed-loop transfer function) are known, commands such as  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{step(num,den)},\\quad\\mathrm{step(num,den,t)}\n$$  \n\nwill generate plots of unit-step responses ( tin the step command is the user-specified time.)  \n\nFor a control system defined in a state-space form, where state matrix A , control matrix B, output matrix C, and direct transmission matrix Dof state-space equations are known, the command  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{step}(\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{B},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{D}),\\quad\\mathrm{step}(\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{B},\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{D},\\mathrm{t})\n$$  \n\nwill generate plots of unit-step responses. When tis not explicitly included in the step commands, the time vector is automatically determined.  \n\nNote that the command step(sys) may be used to obtain the unit-step response of a system. First, define the system by  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{s y s=t f(n u m,d e n)}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{S Y S}=\\mathsf{s s}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D})\n$$  \n\nThen, to obtain, for example, the unit-step response, enter  \n\ninto the computer.  \n\nWhen step commands have left-hand arguments such as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathrm{[y,x,t]}=\\mathsf{s t e p}(\\mathsf{n u m,d e n,t})}\\\\ &{\\mathrm{[y,x,t]}=\\mathsf{s t e p}(\\mathsf{A,B,C,D,i u})}\\\\ &{\\mathrm{[y,x,t]}=\\mathsf{s t e p}(\\mathsf{A,B,C,D,i u,t})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nno plot is shown on the screen. Hence it is necessary to use a plot command to see the response curves.The matrices yand $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}$ contain the output and state response of the system, respectively, evaluated at the computation time points t. ( yhas as many columns as outputs and one row for each element in t. $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}$ has as many columns as states and one row for each element in t. )  \n\nNote in Equation (5–36) that the scalar iu is an index into the inputs of the system and specifies which input is to be used for the response, and tis the user-specified time.

(Note that the time vector tis automatically determined, since the command does not include t.)  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB code snippet, showcasing a program that utilizes an array to store and manipulate data. The code is structured into three main sections: initializing variables, defining functions, and executing operations.\n\n*   **Initialization of Variables**\n    *   `A = [-1 -1;6.5 0];` initializes a matrix `A` with two rows and two columns.\n    *   `B = [1 1;1 0];` initializes another matrix `B` with two rows and two columns.\n    *   `C = [1 0;0 1];` initializes a third matrix `C` with two rows and two columns.\n    *   `D = [0 0;0 0];` initializes an identity matrix `D` with two rows and two columns.\n\n*   **Definition of Functions**\n    *   The code defines no functions in this snippet.\n\n*   **Execution of Operations**\n    *   The code calculates the product of matrices `A`, `B`, and `C`.\n    *   It then assigns the result to a variable named \"ans\".\n    *   Finally, it prints out the value of \"ans\" using the disp function.  \n\nThe image presents a series of four graphs, each displaying a waveform with amplitude on the y-axis and time (in seconds) on the x-axis. The waveforms are labeled as \"From: U1\" and \"From: U2,\" suggesting that they represent signals or data from two different sources or systems.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Waveform Shape:** Each waveform exhibits a unique shape, characterized by peaks and troughs at various time intervals.\n*   **Amplitude Range:** The amplitude values range from approximately -0.4 to 1.5 on the y-axis, indicating a moderate dynamic range.\n*   **Time Scale:** The x-axis spans from 0 to 12 seconds, providing a clear indication of the waveform's duration and temporal characteristics.\n*   **Labeling:** The waveforms are labeled as \"To: Y1\" and \"To: Y2,\" which may imply that they represent outputs or responses from the systems represented by U1 and U2.\n\n**Graph Layout:**\n\nThe graphs are arranged in a 2x2 grid, with two columns and two rows. Each graph has its own title, axis labels, and data points, allowing for easy comparison and analysis of the waveforms.\n\n**Visual Insights:**\n\n*   **Similarities:** The waveforms from U1 and U2 exhibit similar shapes and amplitude ranges, suggesting some level of correlation or similarity between the signals.\n*   **Differences:** However, there are noticeable differences in the waveform patterns, particularly around 4-6 seconds, where the signals diverge slightly.\n*   **Amplitude Variations:** The amplitude values vary across the waveforms, with U1 exhibiting more pronounced peaks and troughs than U2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image provides a visual representation of two waveforms from different sources or systems. While there are similarities in their shapes and amplitude ranges, there are also notable differences that may be indicative of unique characteristics or behaviors in each system. The graphs offer valuable insights into the temporal and amplitude properties of these signals, allowing for further analysis and interpretation.  \nStep Response   \nFigure 5–18 Unit-step response curves.   \nChapter 5 /Transient and Steady-State Response Analyses  \n\nTo plot two step-response curves for the input $u_{1}$ in one diagram and two step-response curves for the input $u_{2}$ in another diagram, we may use the commands  \n\nand  \n\nrespectively. MATLAB Program 5–2 is a program to plot two step-response curves for the input $u_{1}$ in one diagram and two step-response curves for the input $u_{2}$ in another diagram. Figure 5–19 shows the two diagrams, each consisting of two step-response curves. (This MATLAB program uses text commands. For such commands, refer to the paragraph following this example.)  \n\n# MATLAB Program 5–2  \n\nThe image presents a computer program written in a programming language, likely MATLAB or similar, designed to plot step-response curves of a system with two inputs (u1 and u2) and two outputs (y1 and y2). The program is structured into four main sections: \n\n**Section 1:** \n*   This section defines the variables for the inputs and outputs.\n*   It sets up matrices A, B, C, and D to represent the system's coefficients.\n\n**Section 2:** \n*   This section plots the step-response curve when input u1 is u1 (0).\n*   It uses a grid to display the plot and labels it as \"Step-Response Plots: Input = u1 (u2=0)\".\n\n**Section 3:** \n*   This section plots the step-response curve when input u2 is u2.\n*   It also uses a grid to display the plot and labels it as \"Next, we shall plot step-response curves when the input % is u2\".\n\n**Section 4:** \n*   This section combines the two plots into one figure.\n\nThe program provides a clear visual representation of the system's response to different inputs, allowing users to analyze and understand its behavior.  \n\nThe image presents a step-by-step analysis of two different types of response plots, specifically focusing on their amplitudes and time responses. The purpose is to compare and contrast these plots in order to understand their differences.\n\n*   **Step 1: Understanding the Response Plots**\n    *   The top plot shows an input signal with a high amplitude at the beginning, which gradually decreases over time.\n    *   In contrast, the bottom plot exhibits a relatively stable amplitude throughout the entire duration of the input signal.\n*   **Step 2: Analyzing the Amplitudes**\n    *   The top plot displays a clear peak in amplitude during the initial stages of the response, followed by a gradual decline.\n    *   Conversely, the bottom plot maintains a consistent amplitude level from start to finish.\n*   **Step 3: Comparing Time Responses**\n    *   Both plots exhibit similar time responses, with both inputs reaching their maximum amplitudes around the same point in time (approximately 2 seconds).\n    *   However, the top plot shows a more rapid increase in amplitude during this period compared to the bottom plot.\n*   **Step 4: Identifying Key Differences**\n    *   The primary distinction between the two plots lies in their respective amplitude profiles.\n    *   The top plot features a pronounced peak followed by a gradual decrease, whereas the bottom plot maintains a stable amplitude throughout.\n\nIn conclusion, the analysis highlights distinct differences in the amplitude and time responses of the two response plots. While both exhibit similar overall shapes, the top plot displays a more dynamic amplitude profile with an initial peak, whereas the bottom plot remains relatively stable throughout. 5–19 Unit-step response curves.

To write text on the graphics screen, enter, for example, the following statements:  \n\nand  \n\nThe first statement tells the computer to write ‘Y1’ beginning at the coordinates $x\\,=\\,3.4$ ,$y=-0.06.$ . Similarly, the second statement tells the computer to write $\\mathbf{\\hat{Y}}2^{\\bullet}$ beginning at the coordinates $x\\,=\\,3.4$ ,$y=1.4.$ . [See MATLAB Program 5–2 and Figure 5–19(a).]  \n\nAnother way to write a text or texts in the plot is to use the gtext command. The syntax is  \n\nWhen gtext is executed, the computer waits until the cursor is positioned (using a mouse) at the desired position in the screen. When the left mouse button is pressed, the text enclosed in simple quotes is written on the plot at the cursor’s position. Any number of gtext commands can be used in a plot.

The output is displayed as a single line of text, and may be part of a larger program or script.  \n\n# Obtaining the Unit-Step Response of the Transfer-Function System. Let us consider the unit-step response of the system given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{25}{s^{2}+4s\\,+\\,25}}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 5–4 will yield a plot of the unit-step response of this system.A plot of the unit-step response curve is shown in Figure 5–20.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program for generating a unit-step response plot, specifically designed to analyze the behavior of a transfer function. The code is structured into several sections:\n\n**Program Title**\n*   **MATLAB Program 5-4**\n\n**Unit-Step Response Plot Generation**\n*   The first section defines the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function G(s).\n    *   Numerator: 25\n    *   Denominator: [1 4 25]\n*   The second section sets up a step input signal with an amplitude of 1.\n*   In the third section, the program generates the unit-step response using the `step` command and plots it.\n\n**Command Line**\n*   **Step Command**: This command calculates and displays the step response of a system defined by its transfer function.\n*   **Plot Command**: The plot command is used to visualize the generated unit-step response in the time domain.\n\nIn summary, this MATLAB program generates a unit-step response plot for a given transfer function G(s), providing valuable insights into the system's behavior and performance.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with two lines, one solid and one dotted, plotted against a grid background. The title of the graph is \"Unit-Step Response of G(s) = 25/(s^2+4s+25)\".\n\nHere are the key features of the graph:\n\n*   **Title**: The title indicates that the graph represents the unit-step response of a system with transfer function G(s) = 25/(s^2+4s+25).\n*   **Grid Background**: The background of the graph is a grid, which helps to visualize the data and identify patterns.\n*   **Solid Line**: The solid line on the graph appears to be a smooth curve that increases from left to right. It starts at approximately 0 on the y-axis and ends at around 1.2 on the y-axis.\n*   **Dotted Line**: The dotted line is superimposed over the solid line and has a similar shape, but with some deviations. It also starts at approximately 0 on the y-axis and ends at around 1.1 on the y-axis.\n*   **Y-Axis**: The y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.4, with major ticks at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.4. There are also minor ticks between each major tick.\n*   **X-Axis**: The x-axis ranges from 0 to 3, with major ticks at 0, 1, 2, and 3. There are also minor ticks between each major tick.\n\nIn summary, the graph shows the unit-step response of a system with transfer function G(s) = 25/(s^2+4s+25), which is characterized by a smooth curve that increases from left to right. The dotted line superimposed over the solid line indicates some variations in the data. 5–20 Unit-step response curve.  \n\nNotice in Figure 5–20 (and many others) that the $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis labels are automatically determined. If it is desired to label the $x$ axis and $y$ axis differently, we need to modify the step command. For example, if it is desired to label the $x$ axis as $^{1}\\colon{\\mathsf{S e c}}^{\\prime}$ and the $y$ axis as ‘Output,’ then use step-response commands with left-hand arguments, such as  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{c}=\\mathsf{s t e p}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n},\\mathsf{t})\n$$  \n\nor, more generally,  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{y},\\mathsf{x},\\mathsf{t}]=\\mathsf{s t e p}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n},\\mathsf{t})\n$$  \n\nand use $\\mathrm{\\plot(t,\\boldsymbol{v})}$ command. See, for example, MATLAB Program 5–5 and Figure 5–21.  \n\nThe image displays a code snippet for a MATLAB program, specifically designed to generate a unit-step response. The code is written in black text on a white background and features a title at the top that reads \"MATLAB Program 5-5\" in bold font.\n\nHere are the main points from the image:\n\n* **Code Snippet**\n\t+ The code snippet is enclosed within a dashed-line rectangle.\n\t+ It includes various lines of code, including comments and function definitions.\n\t+ The code uses MATLAB's programming language syntax.\n* **Title and Header**\n\t+ The title \"MATLAB Program 5-5\" is displayed in bold font at the top of the image.\n\t+ Below the title, there is a header section with information about the program, such as its name, version number, and date created.\n* **Background**\n\t+ The background of the image is plain white.\n\nOverall, the image provides a clear view of a specific piece of code written in MATLAB, which can be useful for developers or researchers working with this programming language.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with the title \"Unit-Step Response of G(s) = 25/(s^2+4s+25)\" at the top. The x-axis is labeled \"t Sec\" and ranges from 0 to 3, while the y-axis is labeled \"Output\" and spans from 0 to 1.4.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The graph displays a single line that starts at approximately (0, 0) and gradually increases as time progresses.\n*   The line reaches its peak output value of around 1.2 between t = 0.5 and t = 1.5 seconds.\n*   After reaching the peak, the line begins to decrease and eventually stabilizes at an output value of approximately 1.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe graph illustrates the unit-step response of a system with transfer function G(s) = 25/(s^2+4s+25). The response is characterized by an initial increase in output followed by a stabilization at a lower level. 5–21 Unit-step response curve.   \nObtaining Three-Dimensional Plot of Unit-Step Response Curves with MATLAB. MATLAB enables us to plot three-dimensional plots easily.The commands to obtain three-dimensional plots are “mesh” and “surf.” The difference between the “mesh” plot and “surf” plot is that in the former only the lines are drawn and in the latter the spaces between the lines are filled in by colors. In this book we use only the “mesh” command.  \n\nEXAMPLE 5–4 Consider the closed-loop system defined by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\n(The undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ is normalized to 1.) Plot unit-step response curves $c(t)$ when $\\zeta$ assumes the following values:  \n\n$$\n\\zeta=0,\\:0.2,\\:0.4,\\:0.6.\\:0.8,\\:1.0\n$$  \n\nAlso plot a three-dimensional plot.  \n\nAn illustrative MATLAB Program for plotting a two-dimensional diagram and a threedimensional diagram of unit-step response curves of this second-order system is given in MATLAB Program 5–6. The resulting plots are shown in Figures 5–22(a) and (b), respectively. Notice that we used the command mesh(t,zeta,y') to plot the three-dimensional plot.We may use a command mesh(y') to get the same result. [Note that command mesh(t,zeta,y) or mesh(y) will produce a three-dimensional plot the same as Figure 5–22(b), except that $x$ axis and $y$ axis are interchanged. See Problem A–5–15 .]  \n\nWhen we want to solve a problem using MATLAB and if the solution process involves many repetitive computations, various approaches may be conceived to simplify the MATLAB program.A frequently used approach to simplify the computation is to use “for loops.”MATLAB Program 5–6 uses such a “for loop.” In this book many MATLAB programs using “for loops” are presented for solving a variety of problems. Readers are advised to study all those problems carefully to familiarize themselves with the approach.  \n\n# MATLAB Program 5–6  \n\n$\\%$ ------- Two-dimensional plot and three-dimensional plot of unit-step   \n$\\%$ response curves for the standard second-order system with wn $\\l=\\,1$   \n$\\%$ and zeta $=0$ , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. -------   \n$t=0{:}0.2{:}10$ ;  \nzeta = [0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1];   \nfor $\\mathsf{n}=1:6$ ;  \nnum $\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{l}}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{l}}\\right]$ ;  \n$\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\quad2^{*}z e t a(n)\\quad1]$ 1];   \n$\\lbrack\\mathsf{y}(1:51\\,,\\mathsf{n}),\\mathsf{x},\\mathsf{t}]=\\mathsf{s t e p}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n},\\mathsf{t});$   \nend   \n$\\%$ To plot a two-dimensional diagram, enter the command plot(t,y).   \nplot(t,y)   \ngrid   \ntitle('Plot of Unit-Step Response Curves with \\omega_n $\\l=1$ and \\zeta $=0$ , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1') xlabel('t (sec)')   \nylabel('Response')   \n$\\operatorname{text}(4.1\\,,1\\,.86,\"\\!\\!\\nabla\\mathrm{eta}=0^{\\prime})$   \ntext(3.5,1.5,'0.2')   \ntext(3 .5,1.24,'0.4')   \ntext(3.5,1.08,'0.6')   \ntext(3.5,0.95,'0.8')   \ntext(3.5,0.86,'1.0')   \n$\\%$ To plot a three-dimensional diagram, enter the command mesh(t,zeta,y').   \nmesh(t,zeta,y')   \ntitle('Three-Dimensional Plot of Unit-Step Response Curves')   \nxlabel('t Sec')   \nylabel('\\zeta')   \nzlabel('Response')  \n\nThe image presents a plot of unit-step response curves, showcasing the dynamic behavior of a system over time.

The graph is titled \"Step Response\" at the top.\n\n**Graph Features:**\n\n*   The graph features a single curve that begins at approximately (0, 0) on the axes and ends at approximately (5, 1).\n*   The curve exhibits an initial rapid increase in amplitude, followed by a gradual decrease as time progresses.\n*   The peak amplitude of the curve occurs around 0.5 seconds, with a value slightly above 1.\n*   The curve then begins to descend, eventually stabilizing at approximately 1 second with an amplitude of roughly 1.\n\n**Axes:**\n\n*   **X-axis (Time):**\n    *   The x-axis is labeled \"Time (sec)\" and ranges from 0 to 5 seconds in increments of 1 second.\n    *   The axis is marked with tick marks at each integer value, providing a clear visual representation of time progression.\n*   **Y-axis (Amplitude):**\n    *   The y-axis is labeled \"Amplitude\" and ranges from 0 to 1.4 in increments of 0.2.\n    *   Like the x-axis, it features tick marks at each integer value, facilitating easy reading of amplitude values.\n\n**Background:**\n\n*   The background of the graph is white, providing a clean and neutral visual environment for interpreting the step response data.\n\nOverall, the graph effectively illustrates the dynamic behavior of a system's step response over time, offering valuable insights into its performance characteristics. 5–23 Unit-step response curve.  \n\nImpulse Response. The unit-impulse response of a control system may be obtained by using any of the impulse commands such as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\{\\mathrm{y},\\mathrm{x},\\mathrm{t}\\}=\\mathsf{i m p u l s e}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})}\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\{\\mathrm{[y},\\mathrm{x},\\mathrm{t}]}=\\mathsf{i m p u l s e}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n},\\mathrm{t})}\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\\\ {\\ }\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe command impulse(num,den) plots the unit-impulse response on the screen. The command impulse(A,B,C,D) produces a series of unit-impulse-response plots, one for each input and output combination of the system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}}\\\\ {\\quad}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{u}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that in Equations (5–42) and (5–43) the scalar iu is an index into the inputs of the system and specifies which input to be used for the impulse response.  \n\nNote also that if the command used does not include “ t” explicitly, the time vector is automatically determined. If the command includes the user-supplied time vector “ t”, as do the commands given by Equations (5–41) and (5–43)], this vector specifies the times at which the impulse response is to be computed.  \n\nIf MATLAB is invoked with the left-hand argument $[\\upgamma,\\uptimes,\\up t]$ , such as in the case of $\\mathrm{[y,x,t]=}$ impulse(A,B,C,D) , the command returns the output and state responses of the system and the time vector t. No plot is drawn on the screen.The matrices yand $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}$ contain the output and state responses of the system evaluated at the time points t. ( yhas as many columns as outputs and one row for each element in t.xhas as many columns as state variables and one row for each element in t.) To plot the response curve, we must include a plot command, such as plot (t,y ).  \n\nObtain the unit-impulse response of the following system:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=G(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,0.2s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 5–8 will produce the unit-impulse response. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 5–24.  \n\nThe image displays a graph and code for unit-impulse response.\n\n*   The top section of the image is a box containing MATLAB program code.\n    *   It includes a title \"MATLAB Program 5-8\" and a grid of numbers from 0 to 1 on both axes.\n    *   The code defines a function G(s) as 1/(s^2 + 0.2s + 1), which is likely used to generate the graph below it.\n*   Below the MATLAB program box is a graph with a title \"Unit-Impulse Response of G(s) = 1/(s^2 + 0.2s + 1)\".\n    *   The x-axis ranges from -0.8 to 50, while the y-axis ranges from -0.6 to 1.\n    *   The graph shows a waveform that starts at around 0.7 on the y-axis and decreases rapidly over time until it reaches approximately 0.4 after about 10 units of time.\n\nThe image provides a visual representation of the unit-impulse response of a given function, allowing for analysis and understanding of its behavior over time.  \n\nAlternative Approach to Obtain Impulse Response. Note that when the initial conditions are zero, the unit-impulse response of $G(s)$ is the same as the unit-step response of $s G(s)$ .  \n\nConsider the unit-impulse response of the system considered in Example 5–5. Since $R(s)\\,=\\,1$ for the unit-impulse input, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=C(s)=G(s)=\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,0.2s\\,+\\,1}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\frac{s}{s^{2}\\,+\\,0.2s\\,+\\,1}\\frac{1}{s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe can thus convert the unit-impulse response of $G(s)$ to the unit-step response of $s G(s)$ .  \n\nIf we enter the following num and den into MATLAB,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathsf{n u m}=[0\\ \\mathsf{\\ 1}\\ \\mathsf{\\ 0}]}\\\\ {\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\ \\ 0.2\\ \\mathsf{\\ 1}]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand use the step-response command; as given in MATLAB Program 5–9, we obtain a plot of the unit-impulse response of the system as shown in Figure 5–25.  \n\nThis image depicts a simple programming code snippet for MATLAB, written in black text on a white background.\n\nThe code is contained within a white rectangle with black text and includes three lines of code: one defining a variable (\"num\"), another specifying a step size (\"step\"), and a third line that sets up a grid using the \"grid\" function. The final line presents an equation for calculating the unit-step response of a system. \n\nThe image appears to be a screenshot from a larger document, as it lacks additional context or headers, suggesting that this is part of a longer text or resource related to programming in MATLAB.\n\nOverall, the image presents a concise and clear representation of a specific mathematical function, utilizing the popular MATLAB programming language.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with the title \"Unit-Step Response of sG(s) = s/(s^2+0.2s+1)\" at the top. The x-axis is labeled \"Time (sec)\" and spans from 0 to 50 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled \"Amplitude\" and ranges from -0.8 to 1.\n\n**Graph Description:**\n\n*   The graph features a single black line that oscillates between positive and negative values as it moves along the x-axis.\n*   The amplitude of the oscillations decreases gradually over time, with the highest peak occurring at approximately 5 seconds and reaching an amplitude of around 0.9.\n*   The lowest point on the graph is observed at about 45 seconds, where the amplitude drops to -0.8.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe graph appears to depict a damped oscillation, with the amplitude decreasing over time due to some form of damping or attenuation. The exact nature and purpose of this plot are not immediately clear without additional context or information. 5–25 Unit-impulseresponse curve obtained as the unitstep response of $s G(s)=$ $s/\\bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,0.2s\\,+\\,1\\bigr).$ .  \n\nRamp Response. There is no ramp command in MATLAB. Therefore, we need to use the step command or the lsim command (presented later) to obtain the ramp response. Specifically, to obtain the ramp response of the transfer-function system $G(s)$ ,divide $G(s)$ by $s$ and use the step-response command. For example, consider the closedloop system  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{2s\\,+\\,1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nFor a unit-ramp input, $R(s)\\,=\\,1/s^{2}$ . Hence  \n\n$$\nC(s)\\,=\\frac{2s\\,+\\,1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,1}\\frac{1}{s^{2}}=\\frac{2s\\,+\\,1}{(s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,1)s}\\frac{1}{s}\n$$  \n\nTo obtain the unit-ramp response of this system, enter the following numerator and denominator into the MATLAB program:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\mathsf{n u m}=[2\\ \\ 1];}}\\\\ {{\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\ \\ 1\\ \\ 1\\ \\ 0];}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand use the step-response command. See MATLAB Program 5–10. The plot obtained by using this program is shown in Figure 5–26.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for generating a unit-ramp response curve. The program is written in a text-based format and includes various commands and functions to create the desired plot.\n\n*   **Title**: \n    *   The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 5-10\".\n    *   It suggests that this is a specific example or exercise from a larger collection of programs.\n*   **Unit-ramp response**:\n    *   The first section defines the unit-ramp response as a percentage input to a plot.\n    *   This indicates that the program will generate a curve based on a ramp function, which increases linearly over time.\n*   **Grid**:\n    *   The grid option is set to 'on', which means that the axes and tick marks will be displayed in a grid pattern.\n    *   This helps with visualizing the plot and making it easier to read.\n*   **Plot command**:\n    *   The plot command is used to generate the unit-ramp response curve.\n    *   It takes several arguments, including the input data (t), the output data (u), and options for customizing the appearance of the plot.\n\nOverall, the program generates a unit-ramp response curve based on a specified set of input data. The curve can be customized using various options, such as changing the line color or adding labels to the axes.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the unit-response of a system, with the title \"Unit-Ramp Response Curve for System G(s) = (2s+1)/(s^2+s+1)\".\n\n*   **Title and Equation**\n    *   The title provides information about the type of response curve shown in the plot.\n    *   The equation is likely related to the system's transfer function or mathematical representation.\n*   **Y-axis Label**\n    *   The y-axis label indicates that it represents input/output values, providing context for interpreting the graph.\n*   **X-axis Label**\n    *   The x-axis label specifies time in seconds (s), indicating how the response changes over time.\n*   **Graph Details**\n    *   The graph shows a smooth curve with no visible oscillations or discontinuities, suggesting a stable and well-behaved system response.\n    *   The curve appears to start at zero on both axes and increases linearly as it moves away from them.\n    *   There are no notable features such as peaks, troughs, or inflection points that could indicate specific characteristics of the system's behavior.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a unit-ramp response curve for a given system, characterized by its equation. The graph shows a smooth, linearly increasing curve with no oscillations or discontinuities, indicating stability and predictability in the system's behavior over time. 5–26 Unit-ramp response curve.  \n\nUnit-Ramp Response of a System Defined in State Space. Next, we shall treat the unit-ramp response of the system in state-space form.Consider the system described by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {y=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}+D u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $u$ is the unit-ramp function. In what follows, we shall consider a simple example to explain the method. Consider the case where  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r l}&{\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{\\phantom{-}0}&{\\phantom{-}1}\\\\ {-\\,1}&{-\\,1}\\end{array}\\right],}&&{\\mathbf{B}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right],}&&{\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\mathbf{0}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{C}=[1}&{0],}&&{D=[0]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWhen the initial conditions are zeros, the unit-ramp response is the integral of the unitstep response. Hence the unit-ramp response can be given by  \n\n$$\nz\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{t}y\\,d t\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation (5–44), we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{z}}\\,=\\,y\\,=\\,x_{1}\n$$  \n\nLet us define  \n\n$$\nz=x_{3}\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (5–45) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{3}\\,=\\,x_{1}\n$$  \n\nCombining Equation (5–46) with the original state-space equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\left[{\\dot{x}}_{1}\\right]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\;\\,0}&{\\;\\,1}&{0}\\\\ {-\\,1}&{-\\,1}&{0}\\\\ {\\;\\,1}&{\\;\\,0}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!\\right]}+{\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}u}\\\\ {z={\\left[\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\;\\,0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{2}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $u$ appearing in Equation (5–47) is the unit-step function.These equations can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {z=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}+D D u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{AA}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {-1}&{-1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{A}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\Delta}}\\\\ {\\cdots}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{BB}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{CC}=[0}&{0}&{1],\\qquad D D=[0]}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nNote that $x_{3}$ is the third element of x.

It also starts at a value of approximately 6 on the y-axis and increases linearly to around 10.5 by the end of the graph.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   Both lines exhibit a similar slope, indicating that the system's response is proportional to the input signal.\n*   The output signal lags behind the input signal, suggesting some delay or processing time within the system.\n*   There are no visible oscillations or fluctuations in either line, indicating a stable and consistent response from the system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, the graph shows a linear relationship between the input and output signals of a system, with the output lagging behind the input. The stability and consistency of the system's response are evident from the smooth and continuous lines without any oscillations or fluctuations. 5–28 Unit-ramp response.  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\left[{\\dot{x}}_{1}\\right]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{-\\,1}&{0.5}\\\\ {-\\,1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}}\\right]}+{\\left[\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}}\\right]}\\,u}\\\\ {y={[\\!\\!1\\!\\!}}&{0{]}{\\left[\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}}\\right]}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nUsing MATLAB, obtain the response curves $y(t)$ when the input $u$ is given by  \n\n1. $u=$ unit-step input  \n\n2. $u=e^{-t}$  \n\nAssume that the initial state is $\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\mathbf{0}$ .  \n\nA possible MATLAB program to produce the responses of this system to the unit-step input $\\bar{[u=1(t)]}$ and the exponential input $\\bar{[u=e^{-t}]}$ is shown in MATLAB Program 5–13.The resulting response curves are shown in Figures 5–29(a) and (b), respectively.  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet written in MATLAB, specifically for Program 5-13. The code is displayed within a text box with a thin black border, featuring a white background and black text.\n\nAt the top of the image, centered in bold font, is the title \"MATLAB Program 5-13\". Below this title, the code snippet begins on the left side of the image, spanning three lines. The first line reads \"t = 0:0.1:12;\". This line initializes a variable named \"t\" with values ranging from 0 to 12 in increments of 0.1.\n\nThe second line of the code snippet is indented and features multiple variables assigned different values. These include \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and \"D\", each assigned a value of either 1 or -1. This suggests that the code is designed for analyzing systems with varying inputs, as indicated by the presence of these binary values.\n\nThe third line introduces another variable named \"u\" and assigns it a value of 1(t). This implies that the variable \"u\" represents an input signal that changes over time according to the specified function.\n\nOn the right side of the image, additional code lines are visible. The first line defines a function called \"y = step(A,B,C,D,1,t)\" which likely corresponds to a system's response to the input signal \"u\". This function takes into account the system's parameters A, B, C, and D, as well as the time variable \"t\".\n\nThe next few lines of code involve plotting functions from MATLAB's built-in libraries. These include \"plot(t,y)\" for visualizing the output signal over time and \"grid\" for displaying gridlines on the plot.\n\nFinally, at the bottom of the image, there is a comment section where information about the program is provided. This includes details such as the author's name, version number, date created, and a brief description of what the program does. The entire code snippet is enclosed within a function named \"main\".\n\nOverall, this MATLAB program appears to be designed for simulating and analyzing systems with varying inputs over time, utilizing functions from MATLAB's libraries to visualize outputs and display gridlines on plots.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a MATLAB code snippet that initializes variables, defines a system response function, plots output signals, and includes comments providing information about the program.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of unit-step responses and exponential input/output relationships, comprising two distinct graphs that provide valuable insights into system behavior.\n\n**Unit-Step Response Graph**\n\n*   The top graph illustrates the unit-step response of a system, characterized by an initial slow increase followed by a steady-state value.\n*   The x-axis represents time in seconds (t), ranging from 0 to 12 seconds.\n*   The y-axis displays output values, spanning from 0 to 1.4.\n*   A single curve is plotted, depicting the unit-step response over time.\n\n**Exponential Input/Output Relationship Graph**\n\n*   The bottom graph examines the relationship between exponential input and system output.\n*   The x-axis represents time in seconds (t), ranging from 0 to 12 seconds.\n*   The y-axis displays output values, spanning from -0.2 to 1.2.\n*   Two curves are plotted: one representing the exponential input and another showing the corresponding system output.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n*   Both graphs exhibit a steady-state value for the unit-step response and an asymptotic relationship between exponential input and system output as time approaches infinity.\n*   The graphs provide a visual representation of the system's behavior in response to different types of inputs, offering valuable insights into its dynamics and performance.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe image effectively conveys the unit-step response and exponential input/output relationships of a system through two informative graphs. By analyzing these plots, one can gain a deeper understanding of the system's behavior and make informed decisions about its design and operation. 5–29 (a) Unit-step response; (b) response to input $u=e^{-t}$ .  \n\nResponse to Initial Condition. In what follows we shall present a few methods for obtaining the response to an initial condition. Commands that we may use are “step” or “initial”. We shall first present a method to obtain the response to the initial condition using a simple example.Then we shall discuss the response to the initial condition when the system is given in state-space form. Finally, we shall present a command initial to obtain the response of a system given in a state-space form.  \n\nThe image depicts a simple harmonic oscillator, consisting of a mass (m) attached to a spring with spring constant k. The system is initially at rest and then released from its equilibrium position, causing it to oscillate about the equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Mass (m)**: Represented by a square symbol, the mass is suspended from the top of the image.\n*   **Spring**: Depicted as a zigzag line, the spring connects the mass to the top of the image, providing the restoring force that drives the oscillations.\n*   **Equilibrium Position**: The point at which the mass would be if it were not displaced by an external force or motion. In this case, it is assumed to be located at the top of the image.\n\nWhen the system is released from its equilibrium position, the spring exerts a restoring force on the mass, causing it to oscillate about the equilibrium point. The amplitude and frequency of these oscillations depend on the initial displacement and the properties of the spring (k) and the mass (m).\n\nThe equation of motion for this simple harmonic oscillator can be derived using Newton's second law of motion:\n\nF = ma\n\nwhere F is the net force acting on the mass, m is its mass, and a is its acceleration.\n\nSince the only force acting on the mass in this system is the restoring force exerted by the spring, we can write:\n\nkx = ma\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for x (the displacement from the equilibrium position), we get:\n\nx(t) = A cos(ωt + φ)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the oscillations, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase angle.\n\nThe angular frequency ω is related to the spring constant k and the mass m by:\n\nω = √(k/m)\n\nThis equation shows that the frequency of the oscillations depends on the ratio of the spring constant to the mass. If the mass is increased or the spring constant is decreased, the frequency will decrease accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the image represents a simple harmonic oscillator consisting of a mass attached to a spring with spring constant k. When released from its equilibrium position, the system oscillates about this point due to the restoring force exerted by the spring. The equation of motion for this system can be derived using Newton's second law of motion and is governed by the parameters A, ω, and φ.  \n\nFigure 5–30 Mechanical system.  \n\nConsider the mechanical system shown in Figure 5–30, where $m\\,{=}\\,1\\;\\mathrm{kg},b\\,{=}\\,3\\;\\mathrm{N{-sec/m}}$ , and $k\\,=\\,2\\;\\mathrm{N/m}$ $\\dot{x}(0)\\,=\\,0.05\\,\\mathrm{m/sec}.$ #.

The code is written in a clear and structured manner, making it easy to follow and understand.\n\n*   **Response to Initial Condition**\n    *   This section of the code defines the function `ResponseToInitialCondition` that takes two inputs: `num` and `den`. These variables represent the numerator and denominator polynomials of the transfer function.\n    *   The function uses the `poly2str` function from the Control Systems Toolbox to convert the polynomial coefficients into a string format.\n    *   It then uses the `ss2tf` function to compute the transfer function representation of the system.\n    *   Finally, it returns the resulting transfer function as a vector.\n*   **System Response**\n    *   This section of the code defines the function `SystemResponse` that takes three inputs: `num`, `den`, and `t`. These variables represent the numerator polynomial, denominator polynomial, and time array, respectively.\n    *   The function uses the `poly2str` function to convert the polynomial coefficients into a string format.\n    *   It then uses the `ss2tf` function to compute the transfer function representation of the system.\n    *   Finally, it returns the resulting response as a vector.\n*   **Example Usage**\n    *   This section provides an example usage of the functions defined in the previous sections.\n    *   It demonstrates how to use the `ResponseToInitialCondition` and `SystemResponse` functions to compute the response of a system to an initial condition.\n    *   The code also includes comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable.\n\nOverall, the image provides a clear and concise example of how to use MATLAB to convert a response to an initial condition. The code is well-structured and easy to follow, making it accessible to users with intermediate-level knowledge of MATLAB and control systems.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a single curve, which appears to be a plot of amplitude over time. The x-axis is labeled \"Time (sec)\" and ranges from 0 to 5 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled \"Amplitude\" and spans from 0 to 0.12.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Single Curve:** The graph features only one curve, indicating that it represents a single variable or function.\n*   **Time Axis:** The x-axis is labeled \"Time (sec)\" and extends from 0 to 5 seconds, suggesting that the data being plotted involves time-dependent measurements.\n*   **Amplitude Axis:** The y-axis is labeled \"Amplitude\" and ranges from 0 to 0.12, implying that the graph illustrates changes in amplitude over time.\n*   **Scale:** Both axes have a linear scale, with equal intervals between consecutive ticks.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe graph appears to show a decay or decrease in amplitude over time, as indicated by the downward-sloping curve. The rate of decay seems to be relatively constant throughout the observed period, with no apparent fluctuations or irregularities.\n\n**Possible Applications:**\n\nGiven the nature of the data and the graph's characteristics, potential applications could include:\n\n*   **Signal Processing:** The graph might represent a signal's amplitude over time, allowing for analysis of its properties and behavior.\n*   **Physical Phenomena:** The decay in amplitude could be related to various physical phenomena, such as the attenuation of waves or the decrease in intensity of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nOverall, while more context would be necessary to provide a definitive interpretation, the graph suggests a gradual decline in amplitude over time, with potential implications for signal processing, physics, or other fields. 5–31 Response of the mechanical system considered in Example 5–8.  \n\nResponse to Initial Condition (State-Space Approach, Case 1).

The curves for these variables exhibit different patterns, with x1 decreasing and then stabilizing, while x2 increases to a peak before decreasing again. The graph provides insights into the dynamics of these state variables but does not offer specific information about their meaning or application without additional context. 5–32 Response of system in Example 5–9 to initial condition.  \n\nFor an illustrative example of how to use Equations (5–58) and (5–60) to find the response to the initial condition, see Problem A–5–16 .  \n\nObtaining Response to Initial Condition by Use of Command Initial .If the system is given in the state-space form, then the following command  \n\nwill produce the response to the initial condition.

The title \"MATLAB Program 5-17\" is displayed at the top left corner.\n\n**Program Structure**\n\nThe program consists of two main sections: the input section and the output section.\n\n*   **Input Section**\n    *   The first line defines four variables: `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C`. Each variable is assigned a specific value:\n        *   `t` is set to 0.05:10, indicating an array of values from 0.05 to 1 with increments of 0.05.\n        *   `A` is defined as a matrix with the following elements: [0 1; 0 0], representing a 2x2 matrix.\n        *   `B` and `C` are both set to [0;0], indicating that they are also matrices with two rows and one column each, containing zeros.\n*   **Output Section**\n    *   The program calculates the solution to the system of linear equations using the `y = initial(A,B,C,D,[2;1;0.5],t)` function.\n    *   The output is then displayed in a grid format, showing the values of `y` for each value of `t`.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   The program solves a system of linear equations using the `initial` function from the `ode15s` solver.\n*   The solution is plotted as a function of time (`t`) using a grid display.\n\nOverall, this program demonstrates how to solve and visualize the solution to a system of linear differential equations in MATLAB.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with the title \"Response to Initial Condition\" at the top, featuring a black line that oscillates between 0 and approximately 2.5 on the y-axis against time measured in seconds on the x-axis.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The graph displays a single curve representing the response over time.\n*   The y-axis ranges from 0 to 2.5, with increments of 0.5.\n*   The x-axis spans from 0 to 10 seconds, divided into ten equal intervals.\n*   The title suggests that the graph illustrates how an initial condition affects a system's behavior.\n\n**Visual Interpretation:**\n\nThe oscillating nature of the curve indicates that the response is not constant but rather varies over time. The amplitude of the oscillations appears to decrease as time progresses, suggesting a possible damping effect in the system. However, without additional context or information about the system being modeled, it is challenging to draw more specific conclusions about its behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, the graph provides a visual representation of how an initial condition influences a system's response over time. While some insights can be gleaned from the oscillatory nature and decreasing amplitude of the curve, further analysis would be necessary to fully understand the underlying dynamics of the system being modeled. 5–34 Response $y(t)$ to initial condition.  \n\nThe most important problem in linear control systems concerns stability.That is, under what conditions will a system become unstable? If it is unstable, how should we stabilize the system? In Section 5–4 it was stated that a control system is stable if and only if all closed-loop poles lie in the left-half $s$ plane. Most linear closed-loop systems have closed-loop transfer functions of the form  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{b_{0}s^{m}\\,+\\,b_{1}s^{m-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,b_{m-1}s\\,+\\,b_{m}}{a_{0}s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}}}={\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere the $a$ ’s and $^b$ ’s are constants and $m\\leq n$ . A simple criterion, known as Routh’s stability criterion, enables us to determine the number of closed-loop poles that lie in the right-half $s$ plane without having to factor the denominator polynomial. (The polynomial may include parameters that MATLAB cannot handle.)  \n\nRouth’s Stability Criterion. Routh’s stability criterion tells us whether or not there are unstable roots in a polynomial equation without actually solving for them. This stability criterion applies to polynomials with only a finite number of terms.When the criterion is applied to a control system, information about absolute stability can be obtained directly from the coefficients of the characteristic equation.  \n\nThe procedure in Routh’s stability criterion is as follows:  \n\n1. Write the polynomial in $s$ in the following form:  \n\n$$\na_{0}s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}=0\n$$  \n\nwhere the coefficients are real quantities.We assume that $a_{n}\\neq0$ ; that is, any zero root has been removed.  \n\n2. If any of the coefficients are zero or negative in the presence of at least one positive coefficient, a root or roots exist that are imaginary or that have positive real parts.Therefore, in such a case, the system is not stable. If we are interested in only the absolute stability, there is no need to follow the procedure further. Note that all the coefficients must be positive.This is a necessary condition, as may be seen from the following argument: A polynomial in $s$ having real coefficients can always be factored into linear and quadratic factors, such as $(s+a)$ and $\\left(s^{2}+b s\\,+\\,c\\right)$ the quadratic factors yield complex-conjugate roots of the polynomial.The factor A B$a,b$ $c$ are real. The linear factors yield eal roots and $\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,b s\\,+\\,c\\right)$ yields roots having negative real parts only i $^b$ dcare both positive. For all roots to have negative real parts, the constants a, b, c , and so on, in all factors must be positive.The product of any number of linear and quadratic factors containing only positive coefficients always yields a polynomial with positive coefficients. It is important to note that the condition that all the coefficients be positive is not sufficient to assure stability. The necessary but not sufficient condition for stability is that the coefficients of Equation (5–61) all be present and all have a positive sign. (If all $a$ ’s are negative, they can be made positive by multiplying both sides of the equation by $-1$ .)  \n\n3. If all coefficients are positive, arrange the coefficients of the polynomial in rows and columns according to the following pattern:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r l}{s^{2}}&{{}\\quad}&{e_{1}}&{e_{2}}\\\\ {s^{1}}&{{}\\quad}&{f_{1}}&{{}}\\\\ {s^{0}}&{{}\\quad}&{g_{1}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe process of forming rows continues until we run out of elements. (The total number of rows is $n\\,+\\,1.$ .) The coefficients $b_{1},b_{2},b_{3}$ , and so on, are evaluated as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{b_{1}=\\frac{a_{1}a_{2}\\,-\\,a_{0}a_{3}}{a_{1}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{b_{2}=\\frac{a_{1}a_{4}\\,-\\,a_{0}a_{5}}{a_{1}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{b_{3}=\\frac{a_{1}a_{6}\\,-\\,a_{0}a_{7}}{a_{1}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{.}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe evaluation of the $^b$ ’s is continued until the remaining ones are all zero. The same pattern of cross-multiplying the coefficients of the two previous rows is followed in evaluating the $c$ ’s, $d$ ’s, $e$ ’s, and so on.That is,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle c_{1}=\\frac{b_{1}a_{3}-a_{1}b_{2}}{b_{1}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle c_{2}=\\frac{b_{1}a_{5}-a_{1}b_{3}}{b_{1}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle c_{3}=\\frac{b_{1}a_{7}-a_{1}b_{4}}{b_{1}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nd_{1}={\\frac{c_{1}b_{2}-b_{1}c_{2}}{c_{1}}}\n$$  \n\nThis process is continued until the nth row has been completed.The complete array of coefficients is triangular. Note that in developing the array an entire row may be divided or multiplied by a positive number in order to simplify the subsequent numerical calculation without altering the stability conclusion.  \n\nRouth’s stability criterion states that the number of roots of Equation (5–61) with positive real parts is equal to the number of changes in sign of the coefficients of the first column of the array. It should be noted that the exact values of the terms in the first column need not be known; instead, only the signs are needed. The necessary and sufficient condition that all roots of Equation (5–61) lie in the left-half $s$ plane is that all the coefficients of Equation (5–61) be positive and all terms in the first column of the array have positive signs.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 5–11  \n\nLet us apply Routh’s stability criterion to the following third-order polynomial:  \n\n$$\na_{0}s^{3}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{2}\\,+\\,a_{2}s\\,+\\,a_{3}=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwhere all the coefficients are positive numbers.The array of coefficients becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{s^{3}}}&{{}}&{{a_{0}}}&{{a_{2}}}\\\\ {{s^{2}}}&{{}}&{{a_{1}}}&{{a_{3}}}\\\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\frac{a_{1}a_{2}\\,-\\,a_{0}a_{3}}{a_{1}}}}&{{}}\\\\ {{s^{0}}}&{{}}&{{a_{3}}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe condition that all roots have negative real parts is given by  \n\n$$\na_{1}a_{2}>a_{0}a_{3}\n$$  \n\nEXAMPLE 5–12 Consider the following polynomial:  \n\n$$\ns^{4}\\,+\\,2s^{3}\\,+\\,3s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,5\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nLet us follow the procedure just presented and construct the array of coefficients. (The first two rows can be obtained directly from the given polynomial. The remaining terms are  \n\nobtained from these. If any coefficients are missing, they may be replaced by zeros in the array.)  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{s^{4}\\qquad}&{1}&{3}&{5}\\\\ {s^{3}\\qquad}&{2}&{4}&{0}\\\\ {s^{2}\\qquad}&{1}&{5}\\\\ {s^{2}\\qquad}&{-6}\\\\ {s^{1}\\qquad}&{5}\\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}{c c c c c}{s^{4}\\qquad}&{1}&{3}&{5}\\\\ {s^{3}\\qquad}&{2}&{4}&{\\mathcal{B}}&{\\mathrm{The\\;second\\;row\\;is\\;divided}}\\\\ {s}&{1}&{2}&{0}&{\\mathrm{by\\;2.}}\\\\ {s^{2}\\qquad}&{1}&{5}&&\\\\ {s^{1}\\qquad-3}&&&\\\\ {s^{0}\\qquad}&{5}&&&\\end{array}\\right|\n$$  \n\nIn this example, the number of changes in sign of the coefficients in the first column is 2. This means that there are two roots with positive real parts. Note that the result is unchanged when the coefficients of any row are multiplied or divided by a positive number in order to simplify the computation.  \n\nSpecial Cases. If a first-column term in any row is zero, but the remaining terms are not zero or there is no remaining term, then the zero term is replaced by a very small positive number \u000eand the rest of the array is evaluated. For example, consider the following equation:  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,2s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,2\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe array of coefficients is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c}{{s^{3}}}&{{1}}&{{1}}\\\\ {{s^{2}}}&{{2}}&{{2}}\\\\ {{s^{1}}}&{{0\\approx{\\epsilon}}}&{{}}\\\\ {{s^{0}}}&{{2}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIf the sign of the coefficient above the zero ( \u000e) is the same as that below it, it indicates that there are a pair of imaginary roots. Actually, Equation (5–62) has two roots at $s=\\pm j$ .  \n\nIf, however, the sign of the coefficient above the zero ( \u000e) is opposite that below it, it indicates that there is one sign change. For example, for the equation  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,-\\,3s\\,+\\,2\\,=\\,(s\\,-\\,1)^{2}(s\\,+\\,2)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nthe array of coefficients is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\mathrm{One~sign~change:}\\displaystyle\\left(\\begin{array}{l l l}{{s^{3}}}&{{~~~1}}&{{-3}}\\\\ {{s^{2}}}&{{~~~0\\approx\\epsilon}}&{{2}}\\\\ {{{}}}&{{}}&{{}}\\\\ {{\\diamondsuit^{s1}}}&{{-3-\\displaystyle\\frac{2}{\\epsilon}}}&{{}}\\end{array}\\right)}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{One~sign~change:}\\displaystyle\\left(\\begin{array}{l l l}{{s^{3}}}&{{~~~1}}&{{-~3}}\\\\ {{s^{2}}}&{{~~~0\\approx\\epsilon}}&{{2}}\\\\ {{{}}}&{{}}&{{}}\\\\ {{\\diamondsuit^{s1}}}&{{-~~3-\\displaystyle\\frac{2}{\\epsilon}}}&{{}}\\end{array}\\right).}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThere are two sign changes of the coefficients in the first column. So there are two roots in the right-half $s$ plane. This agrees with the correct result indicated by the factored form of the polynomial equation.  \n\nIf all the coefficients in any derived row are zero, it indicates that there are roots of equal magnitude lying radially opposite in the $s$ plane—that is, two real roots with equal magnitudes and opposite signs and/or two conjugate imaginary roots. In such a case, the evaluation of the rest of the array can be continued by forming an auxiliary polynomial with the coefficients of the last row and by using the coefficients of the derivative of this polynomial in the next row. Such roots with equal magnitudes and lying radially opposite in the $s$ plane can be found by solving the auxiliary polynomial, which is always even.For a $2n$ -degree auxiliary polynomial,there are $n$ pairs of equal and opposite roots. For example, consider the following equation:  \n\n$$\ns^{5}\\,+\\,2s^{4}\\,+\\,24s^{3}\\,+\\,48s^{2}\\,-\\,25s\\,-\\,50\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe array of coefficients is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l r l}{s^{5}}&{\\;1}&{24}&{-25}\\\\ {s^{4}}&{\\;2}&{48}&{-50}&{\\leftarrow{\\mathrm{Auxiliary~polynomial~}}P(s)}\\\\ {s^{3}}&{\\;0}&{\\;0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThe terms in the $s^{3}$ row are all zero. (Note that such a case occurs only in an oddnumbered row.) The auxiliary polynomial is then formed from the coefficients of the $s^{4}$ row.The auxiliary polynomial $P(s)$ is  \n\n$$\nP(s)\\,=\\,2s^{4}\\,+\\,48s^{2}\\,-\\,50\n$$  \n\nwhich indicates that there are two pairs of roots of equal magnitude and opposite sign (that is, two real roots with the same magnitude but opposite signs or two complexconjugate roots on the imaginary axis).These pairs are obtained by solving the auxiliary polynomial equation $P(s)\\,=\\,0.$ The derivative of $P(s)$ with respect to $s$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d P(s)}{d s}=\\,8s^{3}\\,+\\,96s\n$$  \n\nThe terms in the $s^{3}$ row are replaced by the coefficients of the last equation—that is, 8 and 96.The array of coefficients then becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{c c c c c}{s^{5}}&{1}&{24}&{-25}\\\\ {s^{4}}&{2}&{48}&{-50}\\\\ {s^{3}}&{8}&{96}&{\\leftarrow{\\mathrm{Coefficients~of~}}d P\\left(s\\right)/d s}\\\\ {s^{2}}&{24}&{-50}\\\\ {s^{1}}&{112.7}&{0}\\\\ {s^{0}}&{-50}&&\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nWe see that there is one change in sign in the first column of the new array.Thus,the original equation has one root with a positive real part. By solving for roots of the auxiliary polynomial equation,  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c r}{{2s^{4}\\,+\\,48s^{2}\\,-\\,50\\,=\\,0}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{s^{2}\\,=\\,1,}}&{{s^{2}\\,=\\,-25}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{s\\,=\\,\\pm1,}}&{{s\\,=\\,\\pm j5}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\nThese two pairs of roots of $P(s)$ are a part of the roots of the original equation. As a matter of fact, the original equation can be written in factored form as follows:  \n\n$$\n(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,-\\,1)(s\\,+\\,j5)(s\\,-\\,j5)(s\\,+\\,2)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nClearly, the original equation has one root with a positive real part.  \n\nRelative Stability Analysis. Routh’s stability criterion provides the answer to the question of absolute stability.This, in many practical cases, is not sufficient.We usually require information about the relative stability of the system. A useful approach for examining relative stability is to shift the $s$ -plane axis and apply Routh’s stability criterion.That is, we substitute  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,\\widehat{s}\\,-\\,\\sigma\\qquad\\mathrm{(}\\sigma\\,=\\,\\mathrm{constant)}\n$$  \n\ninto the characteristic equation of the system, write the polynomial in terms of $\\hat{s}$ ;and apply Routh’s stability criterion to the new polynomial in s.The number of changes of sign in the first column of the array developed for the polynomial in is equal to the number of roots that are located to the right of the vertical line $s\\,=\\,-\\sigma.$ .Thus, this test reveals the number of roots that lie to the right of the vertical line $s=-\\sigma$ .  \n\nApplication of Routh’s Stability Criterion to Control-System Analysis. Routh’s stability criterion is of limited usefulness in linear control-system analysis,mainly because it does not suggest how to improve relative stability or how to stabilize an unstable system. It is possible, however, to determine the effects of changing one or two parameters of a system by examining the values that cause instability. In the following, we shall consider the problem of determining the stability range of a parameter value.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 5–35. Let us determine the range of $K$ for stability.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K}{s(s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)\\,+\\,K}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\ns^{4}\\,+\\,3s^{3}\\,+\\,3s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe array of coefficients becomes  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation, specifically a system of equations, accompanied by a diagram illustrating the flow of variables through a system. The purpose of the image is to provide a visual representation of the relationships between different components and their interactions.\n\n* A mathematical equation:\n\t+ The equation consists of three parts: an input variable (R(s)), an output variable (C(s)), and a transfer function.\n\t+ The transfer function is represented as a fraction with numerator s^2 + 1 and denominator s(s + 1).\n\t+ The equation also includes a feedback loop, where the output C(s) is fed back into the system through a gain of -k.\n* A diagram showing the flow of variables:\n\t+ The diagram depicts a block diagram with two main blocks: an integrator (s^2) and a summing junction.\n\t+ The input R(s) enters the system through the integrator, which produces an output sR(s).\n\t+ The output is then fed into the summing junction, where it is combined with the feedback loop's output -kC(s).\n\t+ The resulting output C(s) is shown as the final output of the system.\n* A table with numbers and symbols:\n\t+ The table contains a series of equations, each representing a different component of the system.\n\t+ The equations include algebraic expressions involving variables s, R(s), and C(s).\n\t+ The table also includes symbols for constants k and K, which are used in the transfer function and feedback loop.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a comprehensive representation of a control system, including its mathematical equation, block diagram, and component-level equations. The system consists of an integrator, summing junction, and feedback loop, all connected through the input-output relationship described by the transfer function. 5–35 Control system.  \n\nFor stability, $K$ must be positive, and all coefficients in the first column must be positive. Therefore,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{14}{9}>K>0\n$$  \n\nWhen $\\begin{array}{r}{K=\\frac{14}{9}}\\end{array}$ ,the system becomes oscillatory and, mathematically, the oscillation is sustained at constant amplitude.  \n\nNote that the ranges of design parameters that lead to stability may be determined by use of Routh’s stability criterion.  \n\n# 5–7 EFFECTS OF INTEGRAL AND DERIVATIVE CONTROL ACTIONS ON SYSTEM PERFORMANCE  \n\nIn this section, we shall investigate the effects of integral and derivative control actions on the system performance. Here we shall consider only simple systems, so that the effects of integral and derivative control actions on system performance can be clearly seen.  \n\nIntegral Control Action. In the proportional control of a plant whose transfer function does not possess an integrator $1/s$ , there is a steady-state error, or offset, in the response to a step input. Such an offset can be eliminated if the integral control action is included in the controller.  \n\nIn the integral control of a plant, the control signal—the output signal from the controller—at any instant is the area under the actuating-error-signal curve up to that instant.The control signal $u(t)$ can have a nonzero value when the actuating error signal $e(t)$ is zero, as shown in Figure 5–36(a).This is impossible in the case of the proportional controller, since a nonzero control signal requires a nonzero actuating error signal. (A nonzero actuating error signal at steady state means that there is an offset.) Figure 5–36(b) shows the curve $e(t)$ versus $t$ and the corresponding curve $u(t)$ versus $t$ when the controller is of the proportional type.  \n\nNote that integral control action,while removing offset or steady-state error,may lead to oscillatory response of slowly decreasing amplitude or even increasing amplitude, both of which are usually undesirable.  \n\nThe image presents a visual representation of two distinct waveforms, labeled (a) and (b), set against a clean white background. The purpose of this image is to illustrate the differences between these two waveforms.\n\n*   **Waveform (a)**\n\n    *   The waveform is depicted in black on a white background.\n    *   It features an upward-sloping curve that begins at approximately 0 and ends at around 1.\n    *   A horizontal line runs across the middle of the image, dividing it into two sections.\n    *   In the upper section, the waveform starts at roughly 0.5, while in the lower section, it begins at about 0.7.\n*   **Waveform (b)**\n\n    *   The waveform is also depicted in black on a white background.\n    *   It features an upward-sloping curve that begins at approximately 0 and ends at around 1.\n    *   A horizontal line runs across the middle of the image, dividing it into two sections.\n    *   In the upper section, the waveform starts at roughly 0.5, while in the lower section, it begins at about 0.7.\n\nIn summary, the image showcases two waveforms with similar characteristics but distinct starting points and curves. The primary difference between them lies in their initial values and how they evolve over time. 5–36 (a) Plots of $e(t)$ and $u(t)$ curves showing nonzero control signal when the actuating error signal is zero (integral control); (b) plots of $e(t)$ and $u(t)$ curves showing zero control signal when the actuating error signal is zero (proportional control).  \n\nFigure 5–37   \nProportional control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is used to analyze and design feedback control systems. The diagram shows the various components of the system, including the input, output, and controller.\n\n*   **Input**\n    *   The input signal is represented by the symbol R(s).\n    *   It is assumed that the input signal is constant at a value of 1.\n*   **Proportional Controller**\n    *   The proportional controller is represented by the block labeled \"K\".\n    *   It takes the error signal as its input and produces an output signal that is proportional to the error.\n    *   The gain of the controller is denoted by the symbol K.\n*   **Plant**\n    *   The plant is represented by the block labeled \"1/(Ts+1)\".\n    *   It models a first-order system with a time constant Ts.\n    *   The output signal of the plant is given by the equation Y(s) = (K \\* R(s))/(s \\* Ts + 1).\n*   **Output**\n    *   The output signal of the system is represented by the symbol C(s).\n    *   It is assumed that the output signal is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram represents a simple feedback control system consisting of a proportional controller, a plant, and an output measurement. The system has one input signal (R(s)) and one output signal (C(s)). The proportional controller uses the error signal to produce an output signal that is proportional to the error. The plant models a first-order system with a time constant Ts. Finally, the output signal of the plant is measured and fed back to the controller.\n\n**Answer:** The block diagram represents a simple feedback control system consisting of a proportional controller, a plant, and an output measurement.  \n\nProportional Control of Systems. We shall show that the proportional control of a system without an integrator will result in a steady-state error with a step input.We shall then show that such an error can be eliminated if integral control action is included in the controller.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 5–37. Let us obtain the steady-state error in the unit-step response of the system. Define  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{K}{T s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{R(s)\\,-\\,C(s)}{R(s)}}=1\\,-\\,{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}}\n$$  \n\nthe error $E(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nE(s)={\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}}\\,R(s)={\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,{\\frac{K}{T s\\,+\\,1}}}}\\,R(s)\n$$  \n\nFor the unit-step input $R(s)\\,=\\,1/s$ , we have  \n\n$$\nE(s)\\,=\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{T s\\,+\\,1\\,+\\,K}\\frac{1}{s}\n$$  \n\nThe steady-state error is  \n\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}e(t)\\,=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s E(s)\\,=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{T s\\,+\\,1\\,+\\,K}=\\frac{1}{K\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nSuch a system without an integrator in the feedforward path always has a steady-state error in the step response. Such a steady-state error is called an offset. Figure 5–38 shows the unit-step response and the offset.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a single function, which is represented by a black curve. The x-axis and y-axis are labeled, but there is no title or additional information provided.\n\n*   **X-Axis:**\n    *   The x-axis has one tick mark at 0.\n    *   There are two unlabeled arrows pointing to the right, indicating that the axis extends beyond the visible range.\n*   **Y-Axis:**\n    *   The y-axis has one tick mark at 1.\n    *   There is an unlabeled arrow pointing upward, indicating that the axis extends beyond the visible range.\n*   **Graph:**\n    *   The graph features a single black curve.\n    *   The curve starts at (0, 0) and increases gradually before leveling off near the top-right corner of the plot.\n    *   There are no labels or annotations on the graph itself.\n*   **Background:**\n    *   The background is white.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a simple line graph with a single function that starts at (0, 0) and increases gradually before leveling off near the top-right corner of the plot. 5–38 Unit-step response and offset.  \n\nFigure 5–39 Integral control system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the transfer function of a control system. The diagram is divided into several blocks, each representing a specific component or operation within the system.\n\n*   **Input Block**\n    *   Located on the left side of the diagram\n    *   Labeled as \"R(s)\"\n    *   Represents the input signal to the system\n*   **Gain Block**\n    *   Positioned next to the input block\n    *   Labeled as \"+K\"\n    *   Indicates that the input signal is amplified by a gain factor K\n*   **Integrator Block**\n    *   Situated after the gain block\n    *   Labeled as \"1/Ts+1\"\n    *   Represents an integrator with time constant Ts\n    *   Integrates the output of the gain block over time\n*   **Output Block**\n    *   Located on the right side of the diagram\n    *   Labeled as \"C(s)\"\n    *   Represents the output signal of the system\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a simple control system that takes an input signal R(s), amplifies it by a gain factor K, integrates the result over time using an integrator with time constant Ts, and produces an output signal C(s). This basic structure can be used as a starting point for more complex control systems.  \n\nIntegral Control of Systems. Consider the system shown in Figure 5–39. The controller is an integral controller.The closed-loop transfer function of the system is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)\\,+\\,K}\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{R(s)\\,-\\,C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)\\,+\\,K}}\n$$  \n\nSince the system is stable, the steady-state error for the unit-step response can be obtained by applying the final-value theorem, as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s E(s)}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s^{2}(T s+1)}{T s^{2}+s\\,+\\,K}\\frac{1}{s}}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{=\\,0}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIntegral control of the system thus eliminates the steady-state error in the response to the step input. This is an important improvement over the proportional control alone, which gives offset.  \n\nResponse to Torque Disturbances (Proportional Control). Let us investigate the effect of a torque disturbance occurring at the load element. Consider the system shown in Figure 5–40.The proportional controller delivers torque $T$ to position the load element, which consists of moment of inertia and viscous friction.Torque disturbance is denoted by $D$ .  \n\nAssuming that the reference input is zero or $R(s)\\,=\\,0$ , the transfer function between $C(s)$ and $D(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{1}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,b s\\,+\\,K_{p}}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is used to analyze and design the behavior of complex systems. The diagram consists of several blocks and arrows that represent different components and their interactions.\n\n*   **Input Block:**\n    *   The input block represents the external signal or input to the system.\n    *   It is denoted by the letter \"R\" and has an arrow pointing into it.\n*   **Summer Block:**\n    *   The summer block adds up all the signals that enter it.\n    *   It is represented by a circle with a plus sign (+) inside and has arrows pointing towards it from other blocks.\n*   **Controller Block:**\n    *   The controller block processes the input signal and generates an output signal based on its internal logic or algorithm.\n    *   It is denoted by the letter \"C\" and has an arrow pointing out of it to another block.\n*   **Plant Block:**\n    *   The plant block represents the physical system being controlled, such as a mechanical or electrical device.\n    *   It is represented by a rectangle with an arrow pointing into it from the controller block.\n*   **Error Detector Block:**\n    *   The error detector block calculates the difference between the desired output and the actual output of the plant.\n    *   It is denoted by the letter \"E\" and has an arrow pointing out of it to another block.\n\nOverall, the diagram shows how the input signal is processed through the controller and plant blocks to produce an output signal. The error detector block provides feedback about the system's performance, which can be used to adjust the controller's parameters or logic. 5–40 Control system with a torque disturbance.   \nChapter 5 /Transient and Steady-State Response Analyses  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E(s)}{D(s)}=-\\frac{C(s)}{D(s)}=-\\,\\frac{1}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,b s\\,+\\,K_{p}}\n$$  \n\nThe steady-state error due to a step disturbance torque of magnitude $T_{d}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s E(s)}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle~~~~=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{-s}{J s^{2}+b s+K_{p}}\\frac{T_{d}}{s}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle~~~~=-\\,\\frac{T_{d}}{K_{p}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAt steady state, the proportional controller provides the torque $-T_{d}$ ,which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the disturbance torque $T_{d}$ .The steady-state output due to the step disturbance torque is  \n\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{ss}}=-e_{\\mathrm{ss}}={\\frac{T_{d}}{K_{p}}}\n$$  \n\nThe steady-state error can be reduced by increasing the value of the gain $K_{p}$ .Increasing this value, however, will cause the system response to be more oscillatory.  \n\nResponse to Torque Disturbances (Proportional-Plus-Integral Control). To eliminate offset due to torque disturbance, the proportional controller may be replaced by a proportional-plus-integral controller.  \n\nIf integral control action is added to the controller, then, as long as there is an error signal, a torque is developed by the controller to reduce this error, provided the control system is a stable one.  \n\nFigure 5–41 shows the proportional-plus-integral control of the load element, consisting of moment of inertia and viscous friction.  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function between $C(s)$ and $D(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{s}{J s^{3}\\,+\\,b s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}s\\,+\\,\\frac{K_{p}}{T_{i}}}\n$$  \n\nIn the absence of the reference input, or $r(t)\\,=\\,0$ , the error signal is obtained from  \n\n$$\nE(s)\\,=\\,-\\,\\frac{s}{\\,J s^{3}\\,+\\,b s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}s\\,+\\,\\frac{K_{p}}{T_{i}}}\\,D(s)\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical expression, specifically an equation for signal processing or control systems. The equation is represented graphically using symbols and notation commonly found in engineering and mathematics.\n\n*   **Signal Flow Diagram**\n    *   The diagram consists of several blocks connected by arrows, representing the flow of signals through the system.\n    *   Each block contains a mathematical operation or function that is applied to the input signal.\n    *   The output of each block becomes the input for the next block in the sequence.\n*   **Variables and Constants**\n    *   Variables: R (Resistance), Kp (Proportional Gain), Ti (Integral Time Constant), Td (Derivative Time Constant), J (Moment of Inertia), s (Laplace Transform variable)\n    *   Constants: b (unknown constant)\n*   **Mathematical Operations**\n    *   The diagram includes several mathematical operations, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).\n    *   These operations are performed on the input signals to produce the output signals.\n*   **Laplace Transform Variable**\n    *   The variable s represents the Laplace transform of a function.\n    *   It is used to analyze continuous-time systems in the frequency domain.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a mathematical expression for signal processing or control systems using symbols and notation from engineering and mathematics. The diagram illustrates the flow of signals through the system, with each block representing a specific operation or function applied to the input signal. 5–41 Proportional-plusintegral control of a load element consisting of moment of inertia and viscous friction.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the flow of signals within the system.\n\n* A block diagram of a control system:\n\t+ The diagram consists of several blocks connected by arrows.\n\t+ Each block represents a component or process in the system.\n\t+ The arrows indicate the direction of signal flow between components.\n* Various components and their interconnections:\n\t+ There are five distinct components: R, E, K/s, T, and C.\n\t+ Component R is an input to the system.\n\t+ Components E and T are connected by an arrow, indicating that they interact with each other.\n\t+ Components K/s and T are also connected, suggesting a feedback loop or closed-loop control mechanism.\n\t+ Component C appears to be an output of the system.\n* A transfer function block labeled \"K/s\":\n\t+ The transfer function is represented mathematically as K/s, where K is a constant gain and s represents the Laplace variable.\n\t+ This block likely represents a controller or compensator in the system.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a control system with multiple components and their interconnections. The presence of a transfer function block labeled \"K/s\" suggests that this system may employ feedback control principles to regulate its behavior. 5–42 Integral control of a load element consisting of moment of inertia and viscous friction.  \n\nIf this control system is stable—that is, if the roots of the characteristic equation  \n\n$$\nJ s^{3}\\,+\\,b s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}s\\,+\\,\\frac{K_{p}}{T_{i}}=0\n$$  \n\nhave negative real parts—then the steady-state error in the response to a unit-step disturbance torque can be obtained by applying the final-value theorem as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s E(s)}\\\\ &{\\quad=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{-s^{2}}{J_{s}^{3}\\,+\\,b s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}s\\,+\\,\\frac{K_{p}}{T_{i}}^{}}\\frac{1}{s}}\\\\ &{\\quad=0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus steady-state error to the step disturbance torque can be eliminated if the controller is of the proportional-plus-integral type.  \n\nNote that the integral control action added to the proportional controller has converted the originally second-order system to a third-order one. Hence the control system may become unstable for a large value of $K_{p}$ , since the roots of the characteristic equation may have positive real parts. (The second-order system is always stable if the coefficients in the system differential equation are all positive.)  \n\nIt is important to point out that if the controller were an integral controller, as in Figure 5–42, then the system always becomes unstable, because the characteristic equation  \n\n$$\nJ s^{3}\\,+\\,b s^{2}\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwill have roots with positive real parts. Such an unstable system cannot be used in practice.  \n\nNote that in the system of Figure 5–41 the proportional control action tends to stabilize the system,while the integral control action tends to eliminate or reduce steadystate error in response to various inputs.  \n\nDerivative Control Action. Derivative control action, when added to a proportional controller, provides a means of obtaining a controller with high sensitivity. An advantage of using derivative control action is that it responds to the rate of change of the actuating error and can produce a significant correction before the magnitude of the actuating error becomes too large. Derivative control thus anticipates the actuating error, initiates an early corrective action, and tends to increase the stability of the system.  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram, comprising two sections: (a) and (b). Section (a) is a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, while section (b) displays a waveform graph.\n\n**Section (a) Block Diagram**\n\n*   The diagram features several boxes connected by arrows, representing the processing of signals.\n    *   The top-left box contains an input signal labeled \"R(s)\" and is accompanied by a plus sign (+).\n    *   A box to its right has the label \"Kp\" inside it, indicating that it represents a proportional gain controller.\n    *   An arrow points from the \"Kp\" box to another box located further down on the left side of the diagram, which features a fraction with 1 in the numerator and s^2 in the denominator (denoted as 1/s^2).\n*   A horizontal line extends across the middle of the diagram, separating the top portion from the bottom.\n    *   On this line are three letters: \"a,\" \"b,\" and \"c.\"\n    *   The letter \"a\" is positioned at the center of the line, while \"b\" is located on the right side above it, and \"c\" is situated on the left side below it.\n\n**Section (b) Waveform Graph**\n\n*   Below the block diagram lies a waveform graph that appears to represent an oscillating signal.\n    *   The x-axis is labeled with the symbol \"t,\" indicating time.\n    *   The y-axis features three labels: \"c(t),\" \"C(s),\" and \"R(s).\" These likely correspond to different variables or signals being plotted against time.\n    *   The waveform exhibits a sinusoidal pattern, oscillating between positive and negative values.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a technical diagram consisting of two parts: a block diagram illustrating signal processing components and their connections, and a waveform graph showing an oscillating signal over time. 5–43 (a) Proportional control of a system with inertia load; (b) response to a unit-step input.  \n\nAlthough derivative control does not affect the steady-state error directly, it adds damping to the system and thus permits the use of a larger value of the gain $K$ , which will result in an improvement in the steady-state accuracy.  \n\nBecause derivative control operates on the rate of change of the actuating error and not the actuating error itself, this mode is never used alone. It is always used in combination with proportional or proportional-plus-integral control action.  \n\nProportional Control of Systems with Inertia Load. Before we discuss further the effect of derivative control action on system performance, we shall consider the proportional control of an inertia load.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 5–43(a). The closed-loop transfer function is obtained as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{K_{p}}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}}}\n$$  \n\nSince the roots of the characteristic equation  \n\n$$\nJ s^{2}+K_{p}=0\n$$  \n\nare imaginary, the response to a unit-step input continues to oscillate indefinitely, as shown in Figure 5–43(b).  \n\nControl systems exhibiting such response characteristics are not desirable.We shall see that the addition of derivative control will stabilize the system.  \n\nmodify the proportional controller to a proportional-plus-derivative controller whose Proportional-Plus-Derivative Control of a System with Inertia Load. A BLet us transfer function is $K_{p}(1\\,+\\,T_{d}s).$ .The torque developed by the controller is proportional to $K_{p}(e\\,+\\,T_{d}\\dot{e})$ .Derivative control is essentially anticipatory,measures the instantaneous error velocity, and predicts the large overshoot ahead of time and produces an appropriate counteraction before too large an overshoot occurs.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of a system, comprising two distinct sections: (a) and (b). Section (a) features a block diagram illustrating the flow of variables through the system, while section (b) displays a graph that plots the relationship between these variables.\n\n**Section (a): Block Diagram**\n\n*   The block diagram consists of three main components:\n    *   **R(s)**: an input variable\n    *   **Kp(1+Tds)**: a controller with proportional and derivative terms\n    *   **1/Js^2**: an integrator\n\n**Section (b): Graph**\n\n*   The graph depicts the response of the system to changes in the input variable R(s).\n*   The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis represents the output variable C(s).\n*   The graph shows a smooth curve that increases initially and then levels off as time progresses.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a visual representation of a control system's behavior in response to changes in its input. The block diagram highlights the key components involved in this process, including the controller and integrator, while the graph illustrates how these components interact to produce a desired output. 5–44 (a) Proportional-plus-derivative control of a system with inertia load; (b) response to a unit-step input.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 5–44(a). The closed-loop transfer function is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K_{p}\\!\\left(1\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\right)}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}T_{d}s\\,+\\,K_{p}}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation  \n\n$$\nJ s^{2}\\,+\\,K_{p}T_{d}s\\,+\\,K_{p}=0\n$$  \n\nnow has two roots with negative real parts for positive values of $J$ ,$K_{p}$ , and $T_{d}$ .Thus derivative control introduces a damping effect.A typical response curve $c(t)$ to a unitstep input is shown in Figure 5–44(b). Clearly, the response curve shows a marked improvement over the original response curve shown in Figure 5–46(b).  \n\nProportional-Plus-Derivative Control of Second-Order Systems. A compromise between acceptable transient-response behavior and acceptable steady-state behavior may be achieved by use of proportional-plus-derivative control action.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 5–45.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K_{p}\\,+\\,K_{d}s}{J s^{2}\\,+\\,(B\\,+\\,K_{d})s\\,+\\,K_{p}}\n$$  \n\nThe steady-state error for a unit-ramp input is  \n\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ss}}={\\frac{B}{K_{p}}}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\nJ s^{2}+(B\\mathrm{~+~}K_{d})s\\mathrm{~+~}K_{p}=0\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the relationship between three variables: R(s), Kp+KdS, and C(s). The diagram is composed of three primary components:\n\n*   **Input**: The input variable is denoted as R(s) and represented by an arrow pointing towards the first block.\n*   **First Block**: This block contains the expression \"Kp + KdS\" within it. It is connected to both the input (R(s)) and the second block, with arrows indicating that these variables are being processed or manipulated in some way.\n*   **Second Block**: The second block features a mathematical expression: 1 / s * Js+B). An arrow connects this block back to the first block, suggesting that the output of the second block is fed into it.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n*   The presence of the term \"Kp + KdS\" in the first block implies that it may represent a controller or regulator component, possibly used for feedback control.\n*   The expression within the second block resembles a transfer function or a similar mathematical representation often encountered in control systems and signal processing applications.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe diagram likely represents a basic control system architecture, where R(s) serves as an input signal. The first block processes this input along with another variable represented by \"S\", possibly incorporating feedback mechanisms through the inclusion of \"Kp + KdS\". Meanwhile, the second block appears to modify or transform the output from the first block using the transfer function-like expression 1 / s * Js+B).\n\nThis interpretation aligns with common practices in control theory and signal processing, where such block diagrams are used to model, analyze, and design systems that can regulate, stabilize, or manipulate various signals. 5–45 Control system.  \n\nThe effective damping coefficient of this system is thus $B\\,+\\,K_{d}$ rather than $B$ . Since the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of this system is  \n\n$$\n\\zeta=\\frac{B+K_{d}}{2\\sqrt{K_{p}J}}\n$$  \n\nit is possible to make both the steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ for a ramp input and the maximum overshoot for a step input small by making $B$ small, $K_{p}$ large,and $K_{d}$ large enough so that $\\zeta$ is between 0.4 and 0.7.  \n\n# 5–8 STEADY-STATE ERRORS IN UNITY-FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS  \n\nErrors in a control system can be attributed to many factors. Changes in the reference input will cause unavoidable errors during transient periods and may also cause steadystate errors.Imperfections in the system components,such as static friction,backlash,and amplifier drift, as well as aging or deterioration, will cause errors at steady state. In this section, however, we shall not discuss errors due to imperfections in the system components. Rather, we shall investigate a type of steady-state error that is caused by the incapability of a system to follow particular types of inputs.  \n\nAny physical control system inherently suffers steady-state error in response to certain types of inputs.A system may have no steady-state error to a step input, but the same system may exhibit nonzero steady-state error to a ramp input. (The only way we may be able to eliminate this error is to modify the system structure.) Whether a given system will exhibit steady-state error for a given type of input depends on the type of open-loop transfer function of the system, to be discussed in what follows.  \n\nClassification of Control Systems. Control systems may be classified according to their ability to follow step inputs, ramp inputs, parabolic inputs, and so on. This is a reasonable classification scheme, because actual inputs may frequently be considered combinations of such inputs. The magnitudes of the steady-state errors due to these individual inputs are indicative of the goodness of the system.  \n\nConsider the unity-feedback control system with the following open-loop transfer function $G(s)$ :  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K\\bigl(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(T_{m}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}{s^{N}\\bigl(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(T_{p}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}\n$$  \n\nIt involves the term $s^{N}$ in the denominator, representing a pole of multiplicity $N$ at the origin.The present classification scheme is based on the number of integrations indicated by the open-loop transfer function.A system is called type 0, type 1, type 2, p, if $N=0$ ,$N\\,=\\,1,N\\,=\\,2,\\dots,$ , respectively. Note that this classification is different from that of the order of a system. As the type number is increased, accuracy is improved; however, increasing the type number aggravates the stability problem. A compromise between steady-state accuracy and relative stability is always necessary.  \n\nWe shall see later that, if $G(s)$ is written so that each term in the numerator and denominator, except the term $s^{N}$ , approaches unity as $s$ approaches zero, then the openloop gain $K$ is directly related to the steady-state error.  \n\nFigure 5–46 Control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a signal flow graph, which is a visual representation of the relationships between signals and systems. The graph consists of nodes and arrows that represent the flow of signals through the system.\n\n*   **Nodes:**\n    *   There are four nodes in the graph, labeled R(s), E(s), G(s), and C(s).\n    *   Each node represents a signal or a system.\n*   **Arrows:**\n    *   The arrows indicate the direction of signal flow between the nodes.\n    *   There is one arrow pointing from R(s) to E(s), indicating that the output of R(s) is connected to the input of E(s).\n    *   Another arrow points from E(s) to G(s), indicating that the output of E(s) is connected to the input of G(s).\n    *   A third arrow points from G(s) to C(s), indicating that the output of G(s) is connected to the input of C(s).\n*   **System Representation:**\n    *   The graph represents a system with three components: R(s), E(s), and G(s).\n    *   R(s) is likely a reference signal or an external input.\n    *   E(s) is probably an error detector or a feedback mechanism that compares the output of G(s) to the reference signal R(s).\n    *   G(s) represents the main system or controller that processes the error signal from E(s) and produces an output.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a simple feedback control system with three components: R(s), E(s), and G(s). The graph illustrates how these components interact to achieve a specific goal or objective.  \n\nSteady-State Errors. Consider the system shown in Figure 5–46.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function between the error signal $e(t)$ and the input signal $r(t)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E(s)}{R(s)}}=1\\,-{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere the error $e(t)$ is the difference between the input signal and the output signal.  \n\nThe final-value theorem provides a convenient way to find the steady-state performance of a stable system. Since $E(s)$ is  \n\n$$\nE(s)={\\frac{1}{1+G(s)}}\\,R(s)\n$$  \n\nthe steady-state error is  \n\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}e(t)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s E(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s R(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}\n$$  \n\nThe static error constants defined in the following are figures of merit of control systems. The higher the constants, the smaller the steady-state error. In a given system, the output may be the position, velocity, pressure, temperature, or the like. The physical form of the output, however, is immaterial to the present analysis.Therefore, in what follows, we shall call the output “position,” the rate of change of the output “velocity,” and so on. This means that in a temperature control system “position” represents the output temperature,“velocity” represents the rate of change of the output temperature, and so on.  \n\nStatic Position Error Constant $K_{p}$ .The steady-state error of the system for a unit-step input is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s}{1+G(s)}\\frac{1}{s}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\qquad=\\frac{1}{1+G(0)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe static position error constant $K_{p}$ is defined by  \n\n$$\nK_{p}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}G(s)\\,=\\,G(0)\n$$  \n\nThus, the steady-state error in terms of the static position error constant $K_{p}$ is given by  \n\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ss}}={\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,K_{p}}}\n$$  \n\nFor a type 0 system,  \n\n$$\nK_{p}\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{K(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}=K\n$$  \n\nFor a type 1 or higher system,  \n\n$$\nK_{p}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{K{(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)}{(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)}\\cdots}{s^{N}{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)}{(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}\\cdots}}=\\infty,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{for}\\,\\,N\\ge1\n$$  \n\nHence, for a type 0 system, the static position error constant $K_{p}$ is finite, while for a type 1 or higher system, $K_{p}$ is infinite.  \n\nFor a unit-step input, the steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ may be summarized as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,K},\\quad}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,type\\,\\,0\\,systems}}}\\\\ {{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=0,\\quad}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,type\\,\\,1\\,or\\,higher\\,systems}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFrom the foregoing analysis, it is seen that the response of a feedback control system to a step input involves a steady-state error if there is no integration in the feedforward path. (If small errors for step inputs can be tolerated, then a type 0 system may be permissible, provided that the gain $K$ is sufficiently large. If the gain $K$ is too large, however, it is difficult to obtain reasonable relative stability.) If zero steady-state error for a step input is desired, the type of the system must be one or higher.  \n\nStatic Velocity Error Constant $K_{v}$ .The steady-state error of the system with a unit-ramp input is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{s^{2}}}}\\\\ {{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{s G(s)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is defined by  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s G(s)\n$$  \n\nThus, the steady-state error in terms of the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is given by  \n\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\frac{1}{K_{v}}\n$$  \n\nThe term velocity error is used here to express the steady-state error for a ramp input.The dimension of the velocity error is the same as the system error.That is,velocity error is not an error in velocity, but it is an error in position due to a ramp input. For a type 0 system,  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{s K(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}}=0\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two curves, labeled \"r(t)\" and \"c(t)\", plotted against time (t) on the x-axis. The y-axis represents the values of these functions.\n\n*   **Graph:**\n    *   The graph features two curves, one for each function.\n    *   Both curves start at zero when t=0 and increase as t increases.\n    *   The curve for \"r(t)\" is steeper than that for \"c(t)\", indicating a faster rate of change.\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   X-axis (t): labeled with time units, increasing from 0 to an unspecified value.\n    *   Y-axis: not explicitly labeled but presumably represents the values of r(t) and c(t).\n*   **Functions:**\n    *   \"r(t)\": starts at zero when t=0 and increases linearly as t increases.\n    *   \"c(t)\": also starts at zero when t=0 but has a slower rate of increase compared to r(t).\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates the behavior of two functions, r(t) and c(t), over time. While both functions start at zero and increase as time progresses, they exhibit different rates of change, with \"r(t)\" increasing more rapidly than \"c(t)\". 5–47 Response of a type 1 unity-feedback system to a ramp input.  \n\nFor a type 1 system,  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s K(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{s(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}=K\n$$  \n\nFor a type 2 or higher system,  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{s K(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{s^{N}(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}}=\\infty,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{for}\\,{\\cal N}\\ge2\n$$  \n\nThe steady-state error $e_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ for the unit-ramp input can be summarized as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\frac{1}{K_{v}}=\\infty,\\ \\ }}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,type\\0\\;systems}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\frac{1}{K_{v}}=\\frac{1}{K},\\ \\ }}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,type\\1\\;systems}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\frac{1}{K_{v}}=0,\\ }}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,type\\2\\;or\\,\\,higher\\;systems}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe foregoing analysis indicates that a type 0 system is incapable of following a ramp input in the steady state.The type 1 system with unity feedback can follow the ramp input with a finite error.In steady-state operation,the output velocity is exactly the same as the input velocity, but there is a positional error.This error is proportional to the velocity of the input and is inversely proportional to the gain $K$ .Figure 5–47 shows an example of the response of a type 1 system with unity feedback to a ramp input. The type 2 or higher system can follow a ramp input with zero error at steady state.  \n\nStatic Acceleration Error Constant $K_{a}$ .The steady-state error of the system with a unit-parabolic input (acceleration input), which is defined by  \n\n$$\nr(t)=\\frac{t^{2}}{2},\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\geq0}\\\\ {=\\,0,\\quad\\mathrm{~for~}t<0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nis given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}\\frac{1}{s^{3}}}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{\\,=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\operatorname*{lim}s^{2}G(s)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe static acceleration error constant $K_{a}$ is defined by the equation  \n\n$$\nK_{a}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s^{2}G(s)\n$$  \n\nThe steady-state error is then  \n\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{ss}}={\\frac{1}{K_{a}}}\n$$  \n\nNote that the acceleration error, the steady-state error due to a parabolic input, is an error in position.  \n\nThe values of $K_{a}$ are obtained as follows:  \n\nFor a type 0 system,  \n\n$$\nK_{a}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{s^{2}K(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}}=0\n$$  \n\nFor a type 1 system,  \n\n$$\nK_{a}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s^{2}K(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{s(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}=0\n$$  \n\nFor a type 2 system,  \n\n$$\nK_{a}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{s^{2}K{\\left(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1\\right)}{\\left(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1\\right)}\\cdots}{s^{2}{\\left(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\right)}{\\left(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\right)}\\cdots}}=K\n$$  \n\nFor a type 3 or higher system,  \n\n$$\nK_{a}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{s^{2}K{\\bigl(}T_{a}s\\,+\\,1{\\bigr)}(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}{s^{N}{\\bigl(}T_{1}s\\,+\\,1{\\bigr)}(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)\\cdots}}=\\infty,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{for}\\,\\,N\\geq3\n$$  \n\nThus, the steady-state error for the unit parabolic input is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\infty,}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\;type\\;0\\;and\\;type\\;1\\;systems}}}\\\\ {{}}&{{}}\\\\ {{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{K},}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\;type\\;2\\;systems}}}\\\\ {{}}&{{}}\\\\ {{e_{\\mathrm{ss}}=0,}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\;type\\;3\\;or\\;higher\\;systems}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with two curves, labeled \"r(t)\" and \"c(t)\", plotted against time on the x-axis. The purpose of the graph is to illustrate the relationship between these two functions over time.\n\n* A line graph with two curves:\n\t+ The curve for r(t) starts at 0 on the y-axis and increases gradually as t increases.\n\t+ The curve for c(t) also begins at 0 but rises more steeply than r(t), eventually surpassing it.\n* The x-axis is labeled \"t\" and ranges from 0 to an unspecified value:\n\t+ Time is represented on the horizontal axis, with no specific units or scale indicated.\n* The y-axis is unlabeled but has a range of 0 to approximately 1.5:\n\t+ The vertical axis appears to be measured in arbitrary units, with no clear indication of what these units represent.\n\nThe graph suggests that while both r(t) and c(t) start at zero and increase over time, c(t) grows more rapidly than r(t), eventually surpassing it. However, without additional context or information about the units on the axes, it is difficult to draw specific conclusions about the nature of these functions or their practical applications. 5–48 Response of a type 2 unity-feedback system to a parabolic input.  \n\nNote that both type 0 and type 1 systems are incapable of following a parabolic input in the steady state. The type 2 system with unity feedback can follow a parabolic input with a finite error signal. Figure 5–48 shows an example of the response of a type 2 system with unity feedback to a parabolic input. The type 3 or higher system with unity feedback follows a parabolic input with zero error at steady state.  \n\nSummary. Table 5–1 summarizes the steady-state errors for type 0, type 1, and type 2 systems when they are subjected to various inputs. The finite values for steadystate errors appear on the diagonal line.Above the diagonal, the steady-state errors are infinity; below the diagonal, they are zero.  \n\nTable 5–1 Steady-State Error in Terms of Gain $K$   \n\nThis image presents a table with three columns and four rows, showcasing different input systems alongside their corresponding step inputs and ramp inputs.\n\nThe first column, labeled \"Type 0 system,\" features an equation for the response to a unit step input: 1 / (1 + K). The second column, titled \"Step Input r(t) = 1,\" contains an empty cell. Meanwhile, the third column, denoted as \"Ramp Input r(t) =\", is also vacant.\n\nThe middle row corresponds to \"Type 1 system\" and features an equation for the response to a unit step input: 0. The second column remains empty, while the third column displays a formula for the ramp input: 1 / K.\n\nThe bottom row represents the \"Type 2 system.\" It includes an equation for the response to a unit step input: 0, and an empty cell in the second column. In contrast, the third column contains the equation for the ramp input: 0.\n\nOverall, this table provides a concise overview of the responses to different input systems, highlighting their unique characteristics and behaviors.  \n\nRemember that the terms position error, velocity error , and acceleration error mean steady-state deviations in the output position. A finite velocity error implies that after transients have died out, the input and output move at the same velocity but have a finite position difference.  \n\nThe error constants $K_{p},K_{v}$ , and $K_{a}$ describe the ability of a unity-feedback system to reduce or eliminate steady-state error.Therefore,they are indicative of the steady-state performance. It is generally desirable to increase the error constants, while maintaining the transient response within an acceptable range. It is noted that to improve the steadystate performance we can increase the type of the system by adding an integrator or integrators to the feedforward path. This, however, introduces an additional stability problem.The design of a satisfactory system with more than two integrators in series in the feedforward path is generally not easy.  \n\nA–5–1. In the system of Figure 5–49, $x(t)$ is the input displacement and $\\theta(t)$ is the output angular displacement. Assume that the masses involved are negligibly small and that all motions are restricted to be small; therefore, the system can be considered linear.The initial conditions for $x$ and $\\theta$ are zeros, or $x(0-)=0$ and $\\theta(0-)\\,=\\,0.$ . Show that this system is a differentiating element. Then obtain the response $\\theta(t)$ when $x(t)$ is a unit-step input.  \n\nSolution. The equation for the system is  \n\n$$\nb(\\dot{x}\\,-\\,L\\dot{\\theta})\\,=\\,k L\\theta\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nL{\\dot{\\theta}}\\,+\\,{\\frac{k}{b}}\\,L\\theta\\,=\\,{\\dot{x}}\n$$  \n\nThe Laplace transform of this last equation, using zero initial conditions, gives  \n\n$$\n\\left(L s\\,+\\frac k b\\,L\\right)\\!\\theta(s)\\,=\\,s X(s)\n$$  \n\nAnd so  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta(s)}{X(s)}=\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{s}{s\\,+\\,(k/b)}\n$$  \n\nThus the system is a differentiating system.  \n\nFor the unit-step input $X(s)\\,=\\,1/s$ , the output $\\Theta(s)$ becomes  \n\n$$\n\\Theta(s)\\,=\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{1}{s\\,+\\,(k/b)}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of $\\Theta(s)$ gives  \n\n$$\n\\theta(t)=\\frac{1}{L}e^{-(k/b)t}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a diagram of a spring-mass system, which is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering. The diagram shows a mass attached to one end of a spring, with the other end of the spring fixed to a wall or another rigid object.\n\n*   **Mass**\n    *   The mass is represented by a small circle or oval shape.\n    *   It is located at one end of the spring.\n    *   The mass has an arrow pointing towards it, indicating that it is moving in that direction.\n*   **Spring**\n    *   The spring is represented by a curved line that connects the mass to the wall.\n    *   It has two ends: one attached to the mass and the other fixed to the wall.\n    *   The spring is shown as being stretched or compressed, indicating that it is under tension.\n*   **Wall**\n    *   The wall is represented by a solid line that forms the boundary of the system.\n    *   It has an arrow pointing towards it, indicating that it is providing support to the mass and spring.\n*   **Labels and Arrows**\n    *   The diagram includes several labels and arrows that provide additional information about the system.\n    *   The label \"x\" indicates the direction of motion of the mass.\n    *   The arrow pointing towards the wall indicates the force exerted by the wall on the mass and spring.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a simple yet important concept in physics: the interaction between a mass, a spring, and a rigid object. This system is commonly used to study the behavior of oscillations, vibrations, and waves, and it has many practical applications in fields such as engineering, mechanics, and materials science. 5–49 Mechanical system.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct plots, each displaying a different function.\n\n*   The top plot shows an x-axis ranging from 0 to 1 and a y-axis also spanning from 0 to 1.\n    *   A single line is plotted on this graph, starting at (0, 0) and ending at (1, 1).\n        *   This line represents the function x(t), which appears to be a straight line with a slope of 1.\n            *   The function is defined as x(t) = t for all values of t between 0 and 1.\n*   The bottom plot features an x-axis extending from 0 to 3π/2 and a y-axis ranging from -2 to 2.\n    *   A single curve is plotted on this graph, starting at (0, 0) and ending at approximately (3π/2, -2).\n        *   This curve represents the function θ(t), which appears to be an oscillating waveform.\n            *   The function is defined as θ(t) = sin(t) for all values of t between 0 and 3π/2.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two plots that illustrate different mathematical functions: x(t) = t and θ(t) = sin(t). 5–50 Unit-step input and the response of the mechanical system shown in Figure 5–49.  \n\nFigure 5–51 Gear-train system.  \n\nNote that if the value of $k/b$ is large, the response $\\theta(t)$ approaches a pulse signal, as shown in Figure 5–50.  \n\nConsider the gear-train system shown in Figure 5–51. In this system, a load is driven by a motor through the gear train.Assuming that the stiffness of the shafts of the gear train is infinite (there is neither backlash nor elastic deformation) and that the number of teeth on each gear is proportional to the radius of the gear, obtain the equivalent moment of inertia and equivalent viscous-friction coefficient referred to the motor shaft and referred to the load shaft.  \n\nA–5–2. Gear trains are often used in servo systems to reduce speed, to magnify torque, or to obtain the most efficient power transfer by matching the driving member to the given load.  \n\nIn Figure 5–51 the numbers of teeth on gears 1, 2, 3, and 4 are $N_{1},N_{2},N_{3}$ , and $N_{4}$ , respectively. The angular displacements of shafts, 1, 2, and 3 are $\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2}$ , and $\\theta_{3}$ , respectively.Thus, $\\theta_{2}/\\theta_{1}\\,=\\,N_{1}/N_{2}$ and $\\theta_{3}/\\theta_{2}\\,=\\,N_{3}/N_{4}$ .The moment of inertia and viscous-friction coefficient of each gear-train component are denoted by $J_{1},b_{1};J_{2},b_{2}$ ; and $J_{3},b_{3}$ ; respectively. ( $J_{3}$ and $b_{3}$ include the moment of inertia and friction of the load.)  \n\nThe image presents a detailed diagram of a mechanical system, showcasing various components and their interconnections. The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section illustrates the input torque from the motor, while the bottom section depicts the load torque.\n\n**Top Section: Input Torque**\n\n*   A shaft labeled \"Shaft 1\" is connected to an electric motor.\n*   The input torque from the motor is represented by the symbol $T_m(t)$ and is transmitted through a gear with a ratio of 1:2, as indicated by the label \"Gear 1.\"\n*   This gear transmits the torque to another shaft labeled \"Shaft 2,\" which in turn drives two additional gears: \"Gear 2\" and \"Gear 3.\"\n*   The output torques from these gears are represented by the symbols $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.\n\n**Bottom Section: Load Torque**\n\n*   A shaft labeled \"Shaft 4\" is connected to a load, represented by the symbol $T_L(t)$.\n*   This shaft is driven by another gear with a ratio of 3:2, as indicated by the label \"Gear 4.\"\n*   The output torque from this gear is represented by the symbol $T_3$.\n\n**Key Components and Connections**\n\n*   **Shafts:** Four shafts are present in the system, each labeled with a number (1-4).\n*   **Gears:** Three gears are depicted in the diagram: Gear 1, Gear 2, and Gear 3. Gear 4 is also shown.\n*   **Torques:** The input torque from the motor is represented by $T_m(t)$, while the output torques from each gear are denoted as $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_L(t)$ for the load torque.\n*   **Connections:** The shafts are connected to each other through the gears, with the input torque being transmitted from the motor to the load through a series of interconnected gears.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a mechanical system consisting of four shafts, three gears, and two torques (input and output). The system is designed to transmit the input torque from the motor to the load while minimizing energy losses due to friction.  \n\nSolution. For this gear-train system, we can obtain the following equations: For shaft 1,  \n\n$$\nJ_{1}\\ddot{\\theta}_{1}\\,+\\,b_{1}\\dot{\\theta}_{1}\\,+\\,T_{1}=\\,T_{m}\n$$  \n\nwhere $T_{m}$ is the torque developed by the motor and $T_{1}$ is the load torque on gear 1 due to the rest of the gear train.

The program appears to be designed for educational purposes, as indicated by the title \"MATLAB Program 5-23\" at the top.\n\n**Code Structure:**\n\n*   The code consists of three main sections:\n    *   **Initialization:** `num = [5];`\n        *   This line initializes a variable named `num` and assigns it an array containing the single element `[5]`.\n    *   **Matrix Creation:** `den = [1 1 5];`\n        *   This line creates a matrix named `den` with dimensions 3x1, containing the elements `[1; 1; 5]`.\n    *   **Linear System Solution:**\n        *   `t = 0:0.05:10;`\n            *   This line defines an array of values for the variable `t`, ranging from 0 to 10 with a step size of 0.05.\n        *   `r = 2+t;`\n            *   This line creates an array named `r` by adding 2 to each element in the `t` array.\n        *   `c = lsim(num,den,r,t);`\n            *   This line solves a linear system using the `lsim` function from MATLAB's Control Systems Toolbox. The inputs are the numerator and denominator polynomials (`num` and `den`, respectively), the input signal (`r`), and the time array (`t`). The output is stored in the variable `c`.\n        *   `plot(t,r,'-o',t,c,'--')`\n            *   This line plots two signals using the `plot` function:\n                1.  The first plot shows the input signal (`r`) with a dashed line (`'-'`).\n                2.  The second plot displays the output signal (`c`) with a dotted line (`'--'`).\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The program uses MATLAB's Control Systems Toolbox to solve a linear system.\n*   It plots two signals, the input and output of the system, using different line styles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image shows a simple MATLAB program that demonstrates how to use the `lsim` function to solve a linear system and plot the input and output signals. The program is likely used for educational purposes to introduce students to the basics of control systems and signal processing in MATLAB.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with the title \"Response to Input r(t) = 2 + t\" at the top. The x-axis is labeled as \"t Sec,\" indicating that it represents time in seconds, while the y-axis is labeled as \"Output c(t) and Input r(t) = 2 + t,\" suggesting that it measures both the output signal and the input function over time.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Graph Type:** The graph is a line plot, displaying the relationship between the input and output signals over time.\n*   **Axes Labels:**\n    *   X-axis (Horizontal): \"t Sec\"\n    *   Y-axis (Vertical): \"Output c(t) and Input r(t) = 2 + t\"\n*   **Data Points:** The graph includes several data points, represented by small circles or dots along the line. These points are scattered throughout the plot but generally follow a smooth curve.\n*   **Trend Line:** A solid black line runs through the data points, representing the overall trend of the relationship between the input and output signals over time.\n*   **Grid Pattern:** The background of the graph features a grid pattern, comprising light gray horizontal and vertical lines. This grid helps to visually organize the data and make it easier to read.\n*   **Color Scheme:** The graph employs a predominantly black-and-white color scheme, with only minor variations in shading used for the grid lines.\n\n**Visual Representation:**\n\nThe graph effectively illustrates how the output signal responds to changes in the input function over time. By examining the relationship between these two signals, one can gain insights into system behavior or dynamics that may be relevant in various fields such as engineering, economics, or physics. 5–61 Response to input $r(t)\\,=\\,2\\,+\\,t.$ .  \n\nA–5–14. Obtain the response of the system shown in Figure 5–62 when the input $r(t)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nr(t)={\\frac{1}{2}}\\,t^{2}\n$$  \n\n[The input $r(t)$ is the unit-acceleration input.]  \n\nFigure 5–62 Control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the components and their interconnections in a control system. The diagram shows the following elements:\n\n*   **Input**: The input signal to the system is represented by an arrow labeled \"R(s)\".\n*   **Controller**: The controller is represented by a box with the transfer function \"2/(s+1)\" inside it. This indicates that the output of the controller is proportional to the error between the desired and actual outputs, and has a time constant of 1 second.\n*   **Plant**: The plant is represented by a box with no specific transfer function indicated. In this case, we can assume that the plant's dynamics are not relevant to the analysis.\n*   **Output**: The output signal from the system is represented by an arrow labeled \"C(s)\".\n\nOverall, the block diagram shows a simple feedback control loop where the controller adjusts its output based on the difference between the desired and actual outputs.  \n\nSolution. The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{2}{s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,2}}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 5–24 produces the unit-acceleration response.The resulting response,together with the unit-acceleration input, is shown in Figure 5–63.  \n\nThe image displays a MATLAB script that defines and applies a function to an array of numbers. The script is designed to accelerate the response time of a system by applying a certain operation to each element in the input array.\n\n*   The script defines a function `Unit-Acceleration Response` that takes two inputs: `Input` and `Output`.\n    *   The function is defined as follows:\n        ```matlab\nfunction Output = UnitAccelerationResponse(Input, Output)\n```\n    *   The function includes comments explaining its purpose and the operation it performs on each element in the input array.\n*   The script then creates an array of numbers from 1 to 2 with a step size of 0.5, which is assigned to the variable `num`.\n    *   The array is created using the following code:\n        ```matlab\nnum = [1:0.5:2];\n```\n*   The script then applies the `Unit-Acceleration Response` function to each element in the `num` array.\n    *   The operation performed by the function is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but based on the comment, it appears to be an acceleration operation.\n    *   The output of the function is assigned to a new variable called `output`.\n*   Finally, the script prints the values of `num` and `output` using the `fprintf` function.\n\nOverall, the script demonstrates how to define and apply a custom function to an array of numbers in MATLAB.  \n\nThe image depicts a line graph titled \"Unit-Acceleration Response\" that illustrates the relationship between input and output acceleration over time.\n\n**Input Acceleration (Vertical Axis)**\n\n*   The vertical axis represents the input acceleration, with values ranging from 0 to 50.\n*   The input acceleration is measured in units of acceleration, likely in meters per second squared (m/s^2).\n\n**Time (Horizontal Axis)**\n\n*   The horizontal axis represents time, with values ranging from 0 to 10 seconds.\n*   Time is measured in seconds.\n\n**Graph Lines**\n\n*   **Unit-Acceleration Input**: A solid line labeled \"Unit-Acceleration Input\" shows the input acceleration over time. This line follows a smooth curve that increases gradually and then levels off towards the end of the graph.\n*   **Output**: An adjacent line, also solid and unlabeled, represents the output acceleration over time. This line closely follows the shape of the Unit-Acceleration Input line but is slightly offset.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   The two lines intersect around 5 seconds, indicating a point where the input and output accelerations are equal.\n*   Both lines exhibit similar slopes before the intersection point, suggesting that the relationship between input and output acceleration is roughly linear until around 5 seconds.\n\n**Overall Pattern**\n\n*   The graph shows an initial slow increase in both input and output accelerations, followed by a more rapid growth phase. However, after reaching their peak values, the accelerations begin to decline gradually as time progresses.\n*   The similarity between the two lines suggests that there is a direct proportional relationship between the input and output accelerations over this period of time.\n\n**Interpretation**\n\n*   This graph likely represents the response of a dynamic system to an input acceleration. The close correlation between the input and output accelerations indicates efficient energy transfer or transmission within the system.\n*   However, the slight offset between the two lines suggests some degree of damping or resistance in the system, which reduces the effectiveness of the acceleration over time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates a unit-acceleration response curve showing the relationship between input and output accelerations over time. The close correlation between the two lines indicates efficient energy transfer within the dynamic system being modeled. 5–63 Response to unitacceleration input.  \n\nA–5–15.

Consider the system subjected to the initial condition as given below.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation, specifically a system of linear equations. The equation is structured as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n&\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n-10 & -17 & -8\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3\n\\end{bmatrix},\\\\\ny &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThis equation represents a linear transformation from the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ to the vector $\\mathbf{y}$. The matrix on the right-hand side of the first equation is the transformation matrix, which maps $\\mathbf{y}$ to $\\mathbf{x}$. The second equation represents the dot product between $\\mathbf{x}$ and a unit vector in the direction of $x_1$.\n\nThe given information about the values of $y_2$ and $y_3$ is used to solve for $x_1$, which is the solution to the system of equations. \n\nSince $y_2 = y_3 = 0$, we can substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\nx_3\n\\end{bmatrix}\\\\\n&= x_1 + 0 \\cdot x_2 + 0 \\cdot x_3\\\\\n&= x_1.\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is $x_1 = y$.\n\nIn conclusion, the given equation represents a linear transformation from $\\mathbf{y}$ to $\\mathbf{x}$. By solving for $x_1$, we find that $x_1 = y$, which means that the solution is simply the value of $y$.  \n\n(There is no input or forcing function in this system.) Obtain the response y(t) versus t to the given initial condition by use of Equations (5–58) and (5–60).  \n\nSolution. A possible MATLAB program based on Equations (5–58) and (5–60) is given by MATLAB program 5–26.The response curve obtained here is shown in Figure 5–65. (Notice that this problem was solved by use of the command “initial”in Example 5–16.The response curve obtained here is exactly the same as that shown in Figure 5–34.)  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program with a title \"MATLAB Program 5-26\" at the top. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how to create and manipulate arrays in MATLAB.\n\n* A MATLAB program\n\t+ The program starts with the line `t = 0:0.05:10;`, which creates an array of time values from 0 to 10 with a step size of 0.05.\n\t+ The next line `A = [0 1 0 0 1;-10 -17 -8];` defines two arrays A and B, but only the first row of A is shown in the image.\n* A title\n\t+ The title \"MATLAB Program 5-26\" is displayed at the top of the program.\n* A grid\n\t+ The program includes a grid command `plot(t,y)`, which plots the y-values against the x-values (time).\n* Text\n\t+ There are no other text elements in the image.\n\nThe main finding from this image is that it demonstrates how to create and manipulate arrays in MATLAB, specifically creating an array of time values and defining two arrays A and B.  \n\nThe image presents a graph illustrating the response of an initial condition to various input values. The graph is divided into two main sections: the y-axis, labeled \"Output,\" and the x-axis, labeled \"t (sec)\". \n\n*   **Y-Axis**\n    *   Labeled as \"Output\"\n    *   Ranges from 0 to 2.5\n    *   Features a grid pattern with dotted lines at intervals of 0.5 units\n*   **X-Axis**\n    *   Labeled as \"t (sec)\"\n    *   Extends from 0 to 10 seconds\n    *   Displays a grid pattern with dotted lines at intervals of 1 second\n\nThe graph plots a single curve, which starts at the origin (0, 0) and exhibits a smooth, continuous shape. The curve initially increases rapidly before slowing down and eventually reaching a steady state around 8-9 seconds.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a graph showing how an initial condition responds to different input values over time. The graph features two axes: \"Output\" on the y-axis and \"t (sec)\" on the x-axis. A single curve is plotted on the graph, starting at the origin and increasing rapidly before slowing down and reaching a steady state around 8-9 seconds. 5–65 Response y(t) to the given initial condition.  \n\nA–5–17. Consider the following characteristic equation:  \n\n$$\ns^{4}\\,+\\,K s^{3}\\,+\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nDetermine the range of $K$ for stability.  \n\nSolution. The Routh array of coefficients is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{{s^{4}}}&{{1}}&{{1}}&{{1}}\\\\ {{s^{3}}}&{{\\;\\;\\;}}&{{K}}&{{1}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{K-1}{K}}}}&{{1}}&{{}}\\\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{\\displaystyle{s^{1}}}}&{{1-\\frac{K^{2}}{K-1}}}\\\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{1}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor stability, we require that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{K>0}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{K-1}{K}>0}\\\\ {\\displaystyle1-\\frac{K^{2}}{K-1}>0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFrom the first and second conditions, $K$ must be greater than 1. For $K>1$ , notice that the term $1\\,-\\,\\big[K^{2}/(K\\,-\\,1)\\big]$ is always negative, since  \n\n$$\n\\frac{K-1-K^{2}}{K-1}=\\frac{-1+K(1-K)}{K-1}<0\n$$  \n\nThus, the three conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously.Therefore, there is no value of $K$ that allows stability of the system.  \n\nA–5–18. Consider the characteristic equation given by  \n\n$$\na_{0}s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,a_{2}s^{n-2}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}=0\n$$  \n\nThe Hurwitz stability criterion, given next, gives conditions for all the roots to have negative real parts in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial.As stated in the discussions of Routh’s stability criterion in Section 5–6, for all the roots to have negative real parts, all the coefficients $a$ ’s must be positive.This is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition. If this condition is not satisfied, it indicates that some of the roots have positive real parts or are imaginary or zero.A sufficient condition for all the roots to have negative real parts is given in the following Hurwitz stability criterion: If all the coefficients of the polynomial are positive, arrange these coefficients in the following determinant:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta_{n}=\\left|\\begin{array}{c c c c c c c}{{a_{1}}}&{{a_{3}}}&{{a_{5}}}&{{\\cdots}}&{{0}}&{{0}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{a_{0}}}&{{a_{2}}}&{{a_{4}}}&{{\\cdots}}&{{}}&{{\\cdot}}&{{\\cdot}}\\\\ {{0}}&{{a_{1}}}&{{a_{3}}}&{{\\cdots}}&{{a_{n}}}&{{0}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{0}}&{{a_{0}}}&{{a_{2}}}&{{\\cdots}}&{{a_{n-1}}}&{{0}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{.}}&{{.}}&{{.}}&{{}}&{{a_{n-2}}}&{{a_{n}}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{.}}&{{.}}&{{.}}&{{}}&{{a_{n-3}}}&{{a_{n-1}}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{0}}&{{0}}&{{0}}&{{\\cdots}}&{{a_{n-4}}}&{{a_{n-2}}}&{{a_{n}}}\\end{array}\\right|\n$$  \n\nwhere we substituted zero for $a_{s}$ if $s\\,>n$ . For all the roots to have negative real parts, it is necessary and sufficient that successive principal minors of $\\Delta_{n}$ be positive. The successive principal minors are the following determinants:  \n\n$$\n\\Delta_{i}={\\left|\\begin{array}{l l l l}{a_{1}}&{a_{3}}&{\\cdots}&{a_{2i-1}}\\\\ {a_{0}}&{a_{2}}&{\\cdots}&{a_{2i-2}}\\\\ {0}&{a_{1}}&{\\cdots}&{a_{2i-3}}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{a_{i}}\\end{array}\\right|}\\qquad(i\\,=\\,1,2,\\ldots,n\\,-\\,1)\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{s}=0$ if $s\\,>n$ . (It is noted that some of the conditions for the lower-order determinants are included in the conditions for the higher-order determinants.) If all these determinants are positive, and $a_{0}>0$ as already assumed, the equilibrium state of the system whose characteristic  \n\nequation is given by Equation (5–67) is asymptotically stable. Note that exact values of determinants are not needed;instead,only signs of these determinants are needed for the stability criterion. Now consider the following characteristic equation:  \n\n$$\na_{0}s^{4}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{3}\\,+\\,a_{2}s^{2}\\,+\\,a_{3}s\\,+\\,a_{4}=0\n$$  \n\nObtain the conditions for stability using the Hurwitz stability criterion.  \n\nSolution. The conditions for stability are that all the $a$ ’s be positive and that  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\Delta_{2}={\\left|\\begin{array}{l l}{a_{1}}&{a_{3}}\\\\ {a_{0}}&{a_{2}}\\end{array}\\right|}=a_{1}a_{2}-a_{0}a_{3}>0}\\\\ &{\\Delta_{3}={\\left|\\begin{array}{l l}{a_{1}}&{a_{3}}&{0}\\\\ {a_{0}}&{a_{2}}&{a_{4}}\\\\ {0}&{a_{1}}&{a_{3}}\\end{array}\\right|}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\alpha_{1}}(a_{2}a_{3}-a_{1}a_{4})-a_{0}a_{3}^{2}}\\\\ &{=a_{3}(a_{1}a_{2}-a_{0}a_{3})-a_{1}^{2}a_{4}>0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nIt is clear that, if all the $a$ ’s are positive and if the condition $\\Delta_{3}>0$ is satisfied, the condition $\\Delta_{2}>0$ is also satisfied.Therefore,for all the roots of the given characteristic equation to have negative real parts, it is necessary and sufficient that all the coefficients $a$ ’s are positive and $\\Delta_{3}>0$ .  \n\nA–5–19.

The use of integral control action has increased the order of the system by 1. (This tends to produce an oscillatory response.)  \n\nIn the present system, a step disturbance torque will cause a transient error in the output speed, but the error will become zero at steady state. The integrator provides a nonzero output with zero error. (The nonzero output of the integrator produces a motor torque that exactly cancels the disturbance torque.)  \n\nNote that even if the system may have an integrator in the plant (such as an integrator in the transfer function of the plant), this does not eliminate the steady-state error due to a step disturbance torque.To eliminate this,we must have an integrator before the point where the disturbance torque enters.  \n\nA–5–25.

If $K/J\\,=\\,4$ , what value of $K_{h}$ will yield the damping ratio to be 0.6?  \n\nThe image presents two block diagrams, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to represent control systems or signal processing flows. The diagrams are composed of various blocks, each with distinct labels and connections.\n\n**Block Diagram (a)**\n\n*   A box labeled \"R(s)\" is connected to a summer, denoted by the symbol ∑.\n    *   The input to this block is not explicitly shown but is implied to be part of the overall system input.\n    *   The output from this box feeds into another block labeled \"K\" (gain).\n        *   This gain block is followed by an integrator represented by the symbol Σ, indicating that it integrates its input over time.\n            *   The output of the integrator then passes through a delay element, indicated by the symbol D(s), which introduces a delay in the signal flow.\n                *   Finally, the output of this block feeds back into itself with no additional processing or modification.\n*   A separate path originates from another input labeled \"C(s)\" and directly connects to the gain block \"K\".\n    *   This suggests that there is an external input influencing the system's operation.\n\n**Block Diagram (b)**\n\n*   The diagram begins with a box labeled \"R(s)\", similar to the first diagram, which represents the system's reference or setpoint signal.\n    *   This signal then passes through a summer ∑, combining it with an internal feedback loop.\n        *   The output of this summer feeds into another gain block labeled \"K\".\n            *   Following the gain block is a differentiator represented by the symbol D(s), indicating that it computes the derivative (rate of change) of its input over time.\n                *   The differentiated signal then passes through an integrator ∑, which calculates the integral (accumulated sum) of its input.\n                    *   This integrated signal feeds into another gain block labeled \"K\" and connects back to itself without further processing or modification.\n*   A separate path originates from an external input labeled \"C(s)\" and directly connects to the gain block \"K\".\n    *   Similar to diagram (a), this suggests that there is an external influence on the system's operation.\n\nIn summary, both diagrams illustrate control systems or signal processing flows involving reference inputs (\"R(s)\"), gains (\"K\"), integrators (∑), differentiators (D(s)), and feedback loops. The presence of these components indicates that these systems are designed to regulate or process signals based on their reference values while incorporating feedback for stability and control.  \n\n# Figure 5–80  \n\n(a) Unstable satellite attitude control system; (b) stabilized system.  \n\nB–5–24.

If the feedforward path of a control system contains at least one integrating element, then the output continues to change as long as an error is present.The output stops when the error is precisely zero. If an external disturbance enters the system, it is desirable to have an integrating element between the error-measuring element and the point where the disturbance enters, so that the effect of the external disturbance may be made zero at steady state.  \n\nShow that, if the disturbance is a ramp function, then the steady-state error due to this ramp disturbance may be eliminated only if two integrators precede the point where the disturbance enters.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a distinct element within the system.\n\n*   **Input**\n    *   The input to the system is denoted as R(s) and is connected to an adder.\n    *   This suggests that the input signal undergoes some form of processing or transformation before being fed into the next stage of the system.\n*   **Adder**\n    *   The adder combines the input signal with another signal, which is represented by a box labeled \"K\".\n    *   The output of the adder is denoted as R(s) + K and is passed to the next component in the system.\n*   **Multiplier**\n    *   The output of the adder is multiplied by a gain factor, denoted as 20/(s+1).\n    *   This multiplication operation effectively amplifies or attenuates the signal, depending on the value of the gain factor.\n*   **Integrator**\n    *   The product of the multiplier and the adder outputs is then integrated over time using an integral operator, denoted as ∫(-∞)^t.\n    *   The resulting output is denoted as C(s) and represents the cumulative effect of the input signal on the system.\n*   **Output**\n    *   Finally, the output of the integrator is connected to a box labeled \"C(s)\", which represents the final output of the system.\n    *   This output can be interpreted as the response of the system to the input signal.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a control system that processes an input signal through a series of operations, including addition, multiplication, integration, and finally produces an output signal. The specific details of each component suggest that the system is designed to amplify or attenuate the input signal based on its frequency content, while also incorporating feedback mechanisms to stabilize the system's response.  \n\nFigure 5–81 Servo system with tachometer feedback.  \n\n# Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Root-Locus Method  \n\nThe basic characteristic of the transient response of a closed-loop system is closely related to the location of the closed-loop poles. If the system has a variable loop gain, then the location of the closed-loop poles depends on the value of the loop gain chosen. It is important, therefore, that the designer know how the closed-loop poles move in the $s$ plane as the loop gain is varied.  \n\nFrom the design viewpoint, in some systems simple gain adjustment may move the closed-loop poles to desired locations.Then the design problem may become the selection of an appropriate gain value. If the gain adjustment alone does not yield a desired result, addition of a compensator to the system will become necessary. (This subject is discussed in detail in Sections 6–6 through 6–9.)  \n\nThe closed-loop poles are the roots of the characteristic equation. Finding the roots of the characteristic equation of degree higher than 3 is laborious and will need computer solution. (MATLAB provides a simple solution to this problem.) However, just finding the roots of the characteristic equation may be of limited value, because as the gain of the open-loop transfer function varies, the characteristic equation changes and the computations must be repeated.  \n\nA simple method for finding the roots of the characteristic equation has been developed by W. R. Evans and used extensively in control engineering. This method, called the root-locus method, is one in which the roots of the characteristic equation are plotted for all values of a system parameter. The roots corresponding to a particular value of this parameter can then be located on the resulting graph. Note that the parameter is usually the gain, but any other variable of the open-loop transfer function may be used. Unless otherwise stated, we shall assume that the gain of the open-loop transfer function is the parameter to be varied through all values, from zero to infinity.  \n\nBy using the root-locus method the designer can predict the effects on the location of the closed-loop poles of varying the gain value or adding open-loop poles and/or open-loop zeros.Therefore, it is desired that the designer have a good understanding of the method for generating the root loci of the closed-loop system, both by hand and by use of a computer software program like MATLAB.  \n\nIn designing a linear control system, we find that the root-locus method proves to be quite useful, since it indicates the manner in which the open-loop poles and zeros should be modified so that the response meets system performance specifications.This method is particularly suited to obtaining approximate results very quickly.  \n\nBecause generating the root loci by use of MATLAB is very simple, one may think sketching the root loci by hand is a waste of time and effort. However, experience in sketching the root loci by hand is invaluable for interpreting computer-generated root loci, as well as for getting a rough idea of the root loci very quickly.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. The outline of the chapter is as follows: Section 6–1 has presented an introduction to the root-locus method. Section 6–2 details the concepts underlying the root-locus method and presents the general procedure for sketching root loci using illustrative examples. Section 6–3 discusses generating root-locus plots with MATLAB. Section 6–4 treats a special case when the closed-loop system has positive feedback. Section 6–5 presents general aspects of the root-locus approach to the design of closed-loop systems. Section 6–6 discusses the control systems design by lead compensation. Section 6–7 treats the lag compensation technique. Section 6–8 deals with the lag–lead compensation technique. Finally, Section 6–9 discusses the parallel compensation technique.  \n\n# 6–2 ROOT-LOCUS PLOTS  \n\nAngle and Magnitude Conditions. Consider the negative feedback system shown in Figure 6–1.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 6–1 Control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, consisting of three main components: R(s), G(s), and H(s). The blocks are interconnected by arrows, indicating the flow of signals between them.\n\n*   **R(s)**:\n    *   Located on the left side of the diagram\n    *   Represented by an arrow pointing to the right\n    *   Labeled with \"R(s)\" in parentheses\n*   **G(s)**:\n    *   Positioned below R(s)\n    *   Denoted by a box with the label \"G(s)\"\n    *   Has an input from R(s) and an output that feeds into H(s)\n*   **H(s)**:\n    *   Situated on the right side of the diagram\n    *   Symbolized by another box labeled \"H(s)\"\n    *   Receives its input from G(s)\n\nThe arrows connecting these blocks suggest a sequential process, where the output of one block serves as the input for the next. This arrangement implies that R(s) processes an input signal, which is then transformed and passed through G(s). The resulting signal from G(s) is subsequently processed by H(s), and its output represents the final response.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a control system comprising three key components: R(s), G(s), and H(s). These blocks are interconnected to form a sequential processing pathway, where each block's output becomes the input for the subsequent one. This configuration allows for the analysis and design of control systems, enabling engineers to optimize performance and achieve desired outcomes.  \n\nThe characteristic equation for this closed-loop system is obtained by setting the denominator of the right-hand side of Equation (6–1) equal to zero.That is,  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)=-1\n$$  \n\nHere we assume that $G(s)H(s)$ is a ratio of polynomials in $s$ .[It is noted that we can extend the analysis to the case when $G(s)H(s)$ involves the transport lag $e^{-T s}$ .]Since $G(s)H(s)$ is a complex quantity, Equation (6–2) can be split into two equations by equating the angles and magnitudes of both sides, respectively, to obtain the following:  \n\nAngle condition:  \n\n$$\n/G(s)H(s)=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\\qquad(k=0,1,2,\\dots)\n$$  \n\nMagnitude condition:  \n\n$$\n|G(s)H(s)|\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nThe values of $s$ that fulfill both the angle and magnitude conditions are the roots of the characteristic equation, or the closed-loop poles. A locus of the points in the complex plane satisfying the angle condition alone is the root locus. The roots of the characteristic equation (the closed-loop poles) corresponding to a given value of the gain can be determined from the magnitude condition. The details of applying the angle and magnitude conditions to obtain the closed-loop poles are presented later in this section.  \n\nIn many cases, $G(s)H(s)$ involves a gain parameter $K$ ,and the characteristic equation may be written as  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,{\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,z_{1})(s\\,+\\,z_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,z_{m})}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})}}=0\n$$  \n\nThen the root loci for the system are the loci of the closed-loop poles as the gain $K$ is varied from zero to infinity.  \n\nNote that to begin sketching the root loci of a system by the root-locus method we must know the location of the poles and zeros of $G(s)H(s)$ .Remember that the angles of the complex quantities originating from the open-loop poles and open-loop zeros to the test point $s$ are measured in the counterclockwise direction.For example,if $G(s)H(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,z_{1})}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})(s\\,+\\,p_{3})(s\\,+\\,p_{4})}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating the process of determining the location of a test point on a graph. The diagram is divided into two sections, labeled (a) and (b), each containing various geometric shapes and lines that represent different mathematical concepts.\n\n*   **Section (a)**\n    *   A large triangle with vertices labeled A1, B1, and C1.\n    *   A smaller triangle within the larger one, sharing a common vertex at point C1.\n    *   Two perpendicular lines intersecting at point C1.\n    *   Four angles labeled θ1, φ1, α1, and β1.\n*   **Section (b)**\n    *   A large triangle with vertices labeled A2, B2, and C2.\n    *   A smaller triangle within the larger one, sharing a common vertex at point C2.\n    *   Two perpendicular lines intersecting at point C2.\n    *   Four angles labeled θ2, φ2, α2, and β2.\n\nThe diagram appears to be related to trigonometry or geometry, as it involves various triangles and angles. The presence of multiple sections with similar geometric shapes suggests that the diagram is used to compare or contrast different mathematical concepts. Overall, the image provides a detailed visual representation of complex mathematical relationships, making it useful for educational purposes or for individuals seeking to understand these concepts in depth.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a technical diagram illustrating the process of determining the location of a test point on a graph, involving various geometric shapes and lines that represent different mathematical concepts. The diagram is divided into two sections, each containing multiple triangles and angles labeled with specific labels. The presence of similar geometric shapes and labels suggests that the diagram is used to compare or contrast different mathematical concepts. Overall, the image provides a detailed visual representation of complex mathematical relationships, making it useful for educational purposes or for individuals seeking to understand these concepts in depth. 6–2 (a) and (b) Diagrams showing angle measurements from open-loop poles and open-loop zero to test point $s$ .  \n\nwhere $-p_{2}$ and $-p_{3}$ are complex-conjugate poles, then the angle of $G(s)H(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\langle G(s)H(s)=\\,\\phi_{1}\\,-\\,\\theta_{1}\\,-\\,\\theta_{2}\\,-\\,\\theta_{3}\\,-\\,\\theta_{4}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\phi_{1},\\theta_{1},\\theta_{2},\\theta_{3}$ ,and $\\theta_{4}$ are measured counterclockwise as shown in Figures 6–2(a) and (b).The magnitude of $G(s)H(s)$ for this system is  \n\n$$\n|G(s)H(s)|={\\frac{K B_{1}}{A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}A_{4}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},A_{4}$ , and $B_{1}$ are the magnitudes of the complex quantities $s\\,+\\,p_{1}$ ,$s\\,+\\,p_{2},s\\,+\\,p_{3},s\\,+\\,p_{4}$ ,and $s\\,+\\,z_{1}$ ,respectively, as shown in Figure 6–2(a).  \n\nNote that, because the open-loop complex-conjugate poles and complex-conjugate zeros,if any,are always located symmetrically about the real axis,the root loci are always symmetrical with respect to this axis.Therefore,we only need to construct the upper half of the root loci and draw the mirror image of the upper half in the lower-half $s$ plane.  \n\nIllustrative Examples. In what follows, two illustrative examples for constructing root-locus plots will be presented. Although computer approaches to the construction of the root loci are easily available, here we shall use graphical computation, combined with inspection, to determine the root loci upon which the roots of the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system must lie. Such a graphical approach will enhance understanding of how the closed-loop poles move in the complex plane as the openloop poles and zeros are moved.Although we employ only simple systems for illustrative purposes, the procedure for finding the root loci is no more complicated for higherorder systems.  \n\nBecause graphical measurements of angles and magnitudes are involved in the analysis, we find it necessary to use the same divisions on the abscissa as on the ordinate axis when sketching the root locus on graph paper.  \n\nConsider the negative feedback system shown in Figure 6–3. (We assume that the value of gain $K$ is nonnegative.) For this system,  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)},\\qquad H(s)=1\n$$  \n\nLet us sketch the root-locus plot and then determine the value of $K$ such that the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of a pair of dominant complex-conjugate closed-loop poles is 0.5.  \n\nFor the given system, the angle condition becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\slash G(s)}{\\slash G(s)}=\\left\\langle\\frac{K}{s(s+1)(s+2)}\\right.}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=-\\big\\langle s-\\big\\langle s+1-\\big\\rangle-\\left.\\frac{\\slash s+2}{\\slash s+1}\\right.}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k+1)\\qquad(k=0,1,2,\\dots)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude condition is  \n\n$$\n|G(s)|\\,=\\,\\left|\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}\\right|\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nA typical procedure for sketching the root-locus plot is as follows:  \n\n1. Determine the root loci on the real axis. The first step in constructing a root-locus plot is to locate the open-loop poles, $s\\,=\\,0,s\\,=\\,-1$ ,and $s=-2$ ,in the complex plane. (There are no openloop zeros in this system.) The locations of the open-loop poles are indicated by crosses. (The locations of the open-loop zeros in this book will be indicated by small circles.) Note that the starting points of the root loci (the points corresponding to $K=0$ ) are open-loop poles. The number of individual root loci for this system is three, which is the same as the number of open-loop poles.  \n\nTo determine the root loci on the real axis, we select a test point, $s$ .If the test point is on the positive real axis, then  \n\n$$\n\\underline{{{\\slash}}}s\\,=\\,\\left\\langle s\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,\\left\\langle s\\,+\\,2\\,=\\,0^{\\circ}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThis shows that the angle condition cannot be satisfied.Hence,there is no root locus on the positive real axis. Next, select a test point on the negative real axis between 0 and $-1$ .Then  \n\n$$\n\\underline{{{\\slash}s}}\\,=\\,180^{\\circ},\\qquad\\underline{{{\\slash}s}}\\,+\\,1=\\,\\underline{{{\\slash}s}}\\,+\\,2=\\,0^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThus  \n\n$$\n-\\,\\Big/s\\,-\\,\\Big/s\\,+\\,1\\,-\\,\\Big/s\\,+\\,2\\,=-180^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nand the angle condition is satisfied.Therefore, the portion of the negative real axis between 0 and $-1$ forms a portion of the root locus. If a test point is selected between $-1$ and $^{-2}$ ,then  \n\n$$\n\\Big/s\\,=\\,\\big/s\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,180^{\\circ},\\qquad\\big/s\\,+\\,2\\,=\\,0^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n-\\,\\Big/s\\,-\\,\\Big/s\\,+\\,1\\,-\\,\\Big/s\\,+\\,2\\,=\\,-360^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nFigure 6–3 Control system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the relationship between three variables: R(s), K, and C(s). The diagram is composed of several components, including:\n\n*   **R(s)**: Represented by an arrow pointing towards the left side of the diagram.\n*   **K**: A gain element symbolized by a rectangle with the letter \"K\" inside it.\n*   **C(s)**: Denoted by an arrow pointing to the right side of the diagram.\n\nThe relationship between these variables is established through a transfer function, which is depicted as follows:\n\nR(s) → K → C(s)\n\nThis transfer function indicates that R(s) serves as the input to the system, and C(s) represents the output. The gain element \"K\" amplifies or attenuates the signal.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a simple feedback loop where R(s) is input into the system through the gain element K, resulting in an output of C(s).  \n\nIt can be seen that the angle condition is not satisfied. Therefore, the negative real axis from $-1$ to $^{-2}$ is not a part of the root locus. Similarly, if a test point is located on the negative real axis from $^{-2}$ to $-\\infty$ , the angle condition is satisfied. Thus, root loci exist on the negative real axis between 0 and $-1$ and between $^{-2}$ and $-\\infty,$ .  \n\n2. Determine the asymptotes of the root loci. The asymptotes of the root loci as $s$ approaches infinity can be determined as follows: If a test point $s$ is selected very far from the origin, then  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{K}{s^{3}}\n$$  \n\nand the angle condition becomes  \n\n$$\n-3\\triangle=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\:+\\:1)\\qquad(k\\:=\\:0,1,2,\\ldots)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Angles~of~asymptotes}}={\\frac{\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)}{3}}\\qquad(k\\,=\\,0,1,2,\\dots)\n$$  \n\nSince the angle repeats itself as $k$ is varied, the distinct angles for the asymptotes are determined as $60^{\\circ},-60^{\\circ}$ , and $180^{\\circ}$ . Thus, there are three asymptotes. The one having the angle of $180^{\\circ}$ is the negative real axis.  \n\nBefore we can draw these asymptotes in the complex plane, we must find the point where they intersect the real axis. Since  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nif a test point is located very far from the origin, then $G(s)$ may be written as  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{K}{s^{3}\\,+\\,3s^{2}\\,+\\,\\cdots}}\n$$  \n\nFor large values of $s$ , this last equation may be approximated by  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\doteq\\frac{K}{(s+1)^{3}}\n$$  \n\nA root-locus diagram of $G(s)$ given by Equation (6–5) consists of three straight lines.This can be seen as follows:The equation of the root locus is  \n\n$$\n\\left/\\frac{K}{(s\\,+\\,1)^{3}}=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\\right.\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n-3\\/s\\,+\\,1=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\n$$  \n\nwhich can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\lceil s\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,\\pm60^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\n$$  \n\nBy substituting $s\\,=\\,\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega$ into this last equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\Big/\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,\\pm60^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}=\\,60^{\\circ},\\qquad-60^{\\circ},\\qquad0^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nTaking the tangent of both sides of this last equation,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}=\\,{\\sqrt{3}}\\,,\\qquad-{\\sqrt{3}}\\,,\\qquad0\n$$  \n\nwhich can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\sigma\\,+\\,1\\,-\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{3}}=0,\\qquad\\sigma\\,+\\,1\\,+\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\sqrt{3}}=0,\\qquad\\omega\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThese three equations represent three straight lines,as shown in Figure 6–4.The three straight lines shown are the asymptotes. They meet at point $s=-1$ .Thus, the abscissa of the intersection of the asymptotes and the real axis is obtained by setting the denominator of the right-hand side of Equation (6–5) equal to zero and solving for $s$ .The asymptotes are almost parts of the root loci in regions very far from the origin.  \n\n3. Determine the breakaway point. To plot root loci accurately, we must find the breakaway point, where the root-locus branches originating from the poles at 0 and $-1$ break away (as $K$ is increased) from the real axis and move into the complex plane.The breakaway point corresponds to a point in the $s$ plane where multiple roots of the characteristic equation occur.  \n\nA simple method for finding the breakaway point is available. We shall present this method in the following: Let us write the characteristic equation as  \n\n$$\nf(s)\\,=\\,B(s)\\,+\\,K A(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a graph with multiple lines and labels, but it lacks a title or any descriptive text. The x-axis is labeled \"σ\" and has no units specified, while the y-axis is labeled \"ω\" and also lacks units.\n\nUpon closer inspection, several key features can be identified:\n\n*   **Lines:** There are at least five distinct lines present in the graph, each with its own unique slope and intercept. These lines appear to represent different functions or relationships between σ and ω.\n*   **Labels:** Various labels are scattered throughout the graph, including \"σ+1-ω/√3=0\", \"-j√3\", \"σ+1+ω/√3=0\", \"ω=0\", and \"ω=0\". These labels likely correspond to specific points or regions on the graph.\n*   **Arrows:** Some arrows are present near the labels, pointing towards or away from certain areas of the graph. These arrows may indicate the direction of change in σ or ω as one moves along the corresponding line.\n\nUnfortunately, without additional context or information about the graph's purpose or significance, it is challenging to provide a more detailed analysis or interpretation of its contents.  \n\nwhere $A(s)$ and $B(s)$ do not contain $K$ . Note that $f(s)=0$ has multiple roots at points where  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d f(s)}{d s}=0\n$$  \n\nThis can be seen as follows:Suppose that $f(s)$ has multiple roots of order $r$ ,where $r\\geq2,$ .Then $f(s)$ may be written as  \n\n$$\nf(s)\\,=\\,\\bigl(s\\,-\\,s_{1}\\bigr)^{r}\\bigl(s\\,-\\,s_{2}\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(s\\,-\\,s_{n}\\bigr)\n$$  \n\nNow we differentiate this equation with respect to $s$ and evaluate $d f(s)/d s$ at $s\\,=\\,s_{1}$ .Then we get  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d f(s)}{d s}\\left|_{s=s_{1}}\\right.=0\n$$  \n\nThis means that multiple roots of $f(s)$ will satisfy Equation (6–7). From Equation (6–6), we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d f(s)}{d s}}=B^{\\prime}(s)\\,+\\,K A^{\\prime}(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nA^{\\prime}(s)=\\frac{d A(s)}{d s},\\qquad B^{\\prime}(s)=\\frac{d B(s)}{d s}\n$$  \n\nThe particular value of $K$ that will yield multiple roots of the characteristic equation is obtained from Equation (6–8) as  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,{\\frac{B^{\\prime}(s)}{A^{\\prime}(s)}}\n$$  \n\nIf we substitute this value of $K$ into Equation (6–6), we get  \n\n$$\nf(s)\\,=\\,B(s)\\,-\\,{\\frac{B^{\\prime}(s)}{A^{\\prime}(s)}}\\,A(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nB(s)A^{\\prime}(s)\\,-\\,B^{\\prime}(s)A(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nIf Equation (6–9) is solved for $s$ , the points where multiple roots occur can be obtained. On the other hand, from Equation (6–6) we obtain  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,{\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d K}{d s}}=-\\,{\\frac{B^{\\prime}(s)A(s)\\,-\\,B(s)A^{\\prime}(s)}{A^{2}(s)}}\n$$  \n\nIf $d K/d s$ is set equal to zero, we get the same equation as Equation (6–9). Therefore, the breakaway points can be simply determined from the roots of  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d K}{d s}=0\n$$  \n\nIt should be noted that not all the solutions of Equation (6–9) or of $d K/d s=0$ correspond to actual breakaway points. If a point at which $d K/d s=0$ is on a root locus, it is an actual breakaway or break-in point. Stated differently, if at a point at which $d K/d s\\,=\\,0$ the value of $K$ takes a real positive value, then that point is an actual breakaway or break-in point.  \n\nFor the present example, the characteristic equation $G(s)\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,0$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}+1=0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK\\,=\\,-\\big(s^{3}\\,+\\,3s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\big)\n$$  \n\nBy setting $d K/d s\\,=\\,0$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d K}{d s}=-\\big(3s^{2}\\,+\\,6s\\,+\\,2\\big)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ns\\,=-0.4226,\\qquad s\\,=-1.5774\n$$  \n\nSince the breakaway point must lie on a root locus between 0 and $-1$ ,it is clear that $s\\,=\\,-0.4226$ corresponds to the actual breakaway point. Point $s=-1.5774$ is not on the root locus. Hence, this point is not an actual breakaway or break-in point. In fact, evaluation of the values of $K$ corresponding to $s\\,=\\,-0.4226$ and $s\\,=\\,-1.5774$ yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{K=0.3849,}}&{{\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\;s=-0.4226}}\\\\ {{{}}}&{{{}}}\\\\ {{K=-0.3849,}}&{{\\quad\\mathrm{for}\\;s=-1.5774}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n4. Determine the points where the root loci cross the imaginary axis. These points can be found by use of Routh’s stability criterion as follows: Since the characteristic equation for the present system is  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,3s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nthe Routh array becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c}{{s^{3}}}&{{\\ }}&{{1}}&{{2}}\\\\ {{s^{2}}}&{{\\ }}&{{3}}&{{K}}\\\\ {{s^{1}}}&{{\\ }}&{{\\displaystyle\\frac{6-K}{3}}}&{{}}\\\\ {{s^{0}}}&{{\\ }}&{{K}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe value of $K$ that makes the $s^{1}$ term in the first column equal zero is $K\\,=\\,6.$ The crossing points on the imaginary axis can then be found by solving the auxiliary equation obtained from the $s^{2}$ row; that is,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{3s^{2}+K=3s^{2}+6=0}}\\\\ {{}}\\\\ {{s=\\pm j\\sqrt{2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhich yields  \n\nThe frequencies at the crossing points on the imaginary axis are thus $\\omega=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ .The gain value corresponding to the crossing points is $K=6$ .  \n\nAn alternative approach is to let $s=j\\omega$ in the characteristic equation, equate both the real part and the imaginary part to zero, and then solve for $\\omega$ and $K$ . For the present system, the characteristic equation, with $s=j\\omega,$ , is  \n\n$$\n(j\\omega)^{3}\\,+\\,3(j\\omega)^{2}\\,+\\,2(j\\omega)\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\big({\\cal K}\\,-\\,3\\omega^{2}\\big)\\,+\\,j\\big(2\\omega\\,-\\,\\omega^{3}\\big)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nEquating both the real and imaginary parts of this last equation to zero, respectively, we obtain  \n\n$$\nK\\,-\\,3\\omega^{2}=0,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;2\\omega\\,-\\,\\omega^{3}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a mathematical diagram featuring two complex numbers, represented by vectors on the complex plane. The first number is denoted as $s$ and has an angle of $\\theta_1$, while the second number is denoted as $s+2$ with an angle of $\\theta_3$. The real part of each vector corresponds to its x-axis value, and the imaginary part corresponds to its y-axis value.  \n\nFigure 6–5   \nConstruction of root locus.  \n\nfrom which  \n\n$$\n\\omega=\\pm\\sqrt{2}\\,,\\qquad K=6\\qquad\\mathrm{or}\\qquad\\omega=0,\\qquad K=0\n$$  \n\nThus, root loci cross the imaginary axis at $\\omega=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ ,and the value of $K$ at the crossing points is 6. Also, a root-locus branch on the real axis touches the imaginary axis at $\\omega=0,$ .The value of $K$ is zero at this point.  \n\n5. Choose a test point in the broad neighborhood of the jvaxis and the origin, as shown in Figure 6–5, and apply the angle condition. If a test point is on the root loci, then the sum of the three angles, $\\theta_{1}\\,+\\,\\theta_{2}\\,+\\,\\theta_{3}$ , must be $180^{\\circ}$ . If the test point does not satisfy the angle condition, select another test point until it satisfies the condition. (The sum of the angles at the test point will indicate the direction in which the test point should be moved.) Continue this process and locate a sufficient number of points satisfying the angle condition.  \n\n6. Draw the root loci, based on the information obtained in the foregoing steps, as shown in Figure 6–6.  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical diagram, likely used to illustrate and explain various mathematical concepts or principles.

Determine a pair of dominant complex-conjugate closed-loop poles such that the damping ratio $\\zeta$ is 0.5. Closed-loop poles with $\\zeta=0.5$ lie on lines passing through the origin and making the angles $\\pm\\cos^{-1}\\zeta=\\pm\\dot{\\cos^{-1}}0.5=\\pm60^{\\circ}$ with the negative real axis.From Figure 6–6,such closedloop poles having $\\zeta=0.5$ are obtained as follows:  \n\n$$\ns_{1}=-0.3337\\,+\\,j0.5780,\\qquad s_{2}=-0.3337\\,-\\,j0.5780\n$$  \n\nThe value of $K$ that yields such poles is found from the magnitude condition as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K=|s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)|_{s=-0.3337+j0.5780}}}\\\\ {{\\ }}\\\\ {{=1.0383}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing this value of $K$ , the third pole is found at $s=-2.3326$ .  \n\nNote that, from step 4, it can be seen that for $K=6$ the dominant closed-loop poles lie on the imaginary axis at $s=\\pm j\\sqrt{2}$ .With this value of $K$ , the system will exhibit sustained oscillations. For $K>6$ ,the dominant closed-loop poles lie in the right-half $s$ plane, resulting in an unstable system.  \n\nFinally, note that, if necessary, the root loci can be easily graduated in terms of $K$ by use of the magnitude condition.We simply pick out a point on a root locus, measure the magnitudes of the three complex quantities $s,s+1$ ,and $s\\,+\\,2$ ,and multiply these magnitudes; the product is equal to the gain value $K$ at that point, or  \n\n$$\n|s|\\,\\cdot\\,|s\\,+\\,1|\\,\\cdot\\,|s\\,+\\,2|\\,=\\,K\n$$  \n\nGraduation of the root loci can be done easily by use of MATLAB. (See Section 6–3.)  \n\n# EXAMPLE 6–2  \n\nIn this example, we shall sketch the root-locus plot of a system with complex-conjugate openloop poles. Consider the negative feedback system shown in Figure 6–7. For this system,  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,2)}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,3},\\qquad H(s)\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nwhere $K\\geq0,$ . It is seen that $G(s)$ has a pair of complex-conjugate poles at  \n\n$$\ns=-1\\,+\\,j\\sqrt{2}\\,,\\qquad s=-1\\,-\\,j\\sqrt{2}\n$$  \n\nA typical procedure for sketching the root-locus plot is as follows:  \n\n1. Determine the root loci on the real axis. For any test point $s$ on the real axis, the sum of the angular contributions of the complex-conjugate poles is $360^{\\circ}$ , as shown in Figure 6–8.Thus the net effect of the complex-conjugate poles is zero on the real axis.The location of the root locus on the real axis is determined from the open-loop zero on the negative real axis.A simple test reveals that a section of the negative real axis, that between $^{-2}$ and $-\\infty$ , is a part of the root locus. It is noted that, since this locus lies between two zeros (at $s=-2$ and $s=-\\infty)$ ), it is actually a part of two root loci, each of which starts from one of the two complex-conjugate poles. In other words, two root loci break in the part of the negative real axis between $^{-2}$ and $-\\infty$ .  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the relationship between two variables, R(s) and C(s), with an intermediate operation involving K(s + 2). The diagram is structured as follows:\n\n*   **R(s)**: This represents the input variable.\n*   **K(s + 2)**: A gain element that multiplies the difference between s and 2 by a constant K. This operation can be interpreted as applying a gain to the output of another system whose transfer function has poles at s = -2.\n*   **C(s)**: The output variable, resulting from the application of K(s + 2) to R(s).\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   The presence of K indicates that there is some form of amplification or scaling applied to the signal before it becomes part of C(s).\n*   The structure suggests a closed-loop control system where R(s) acts as the input, and C(s) represents the output. However, without additional context about how these signals interact within their respective systems (e.g., feedback loops), we cannot infer specific behaviors or dynamics beyond the basic operations depicted.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the block diagram shows a simple signal processing pathway where R(s) is processed by K(s + 2) to produce C(s). Without further information about how these components interact within larger control systems or other environmental factors, we can only describe this as a basic algebraic operation involving scalar multiplication and addition. 6–7 Control system.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two complex numbers, represented as points on the complex plane. The x-axis represents the real part of the complex number, while the y-axis represents the imaginary part.\n\n*   **Complex Number Representation:**\n    *   Each point on the graph corresponds to a specific complex number.\n    *   The first complex number is located at (-2, 1), indicating its real part as -2 and its imaginary part as 1.\n    *   The second complex number is situated at (0, -j√2), showing its real part as 0 and its imaginary part as -j√2.\n*   **Graphical Analysis:**\n    *   Both points lie on the same horizontal line, which suggests a possible relationship between them.\n    *   The distance between the two points is determined by the difference in their real parts (-2 vs. 0) and imaginary parts (1 vs. -j√2).\n*   **Geometric Interpretation:**\n    *   The graph can be interpreted as a representation of complex numbers in the form of vectors or arrows, with the x-axis representing the real axis and the y-axis representing the imaginary axis.\n    *   The points on the graph correspond to specific values of the complex number, allowing for visualization and analysis of their properties.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates two complex numbers plotted on a coordinate system, providing a visual representation of their real and imaginary components. This graphical approach facilitates understanding and comparison of these complex numbers. 6–8 Determination of the root locus on the real axis.  \n\nSince there are two open-loop poles and one zero,there is one asymptote,which coincides with the negative real axis.  \n\n2. Determine the angle of departure from the complex-conjugate open-loop poles. The presence of a pair of complex-conjugate open-loop poles requires the determination of the angle of departure from these poles. Knowledge of this angle is important, since the root locus near a complex pole yields information as to whether the locus originating from the complex pole migrates toward the real axis or extends toward the asymptote.  \n\nReferring to Figure 6–9, if we choose a test point and move it in the very vicinity of the complex open-loop pole at $s=-p_{1}$ ,we find that the sum of the angular contributions from the pole at $s\\,=\\,p_{2}$ and zero at $s=-z_{1}$ to the test point can be considered remaining the same. If the test point is to be on the root locus, then the sum of $\\phi_{1}^{\\prime},-\\theta_{1}$ , and $-\\theta_{2}^{\\prime}$ must be $\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)$ where $k\\,=\\,0,1,2,\\dots.$ Thus, in the example,  \n\n$$\n\\phi_{1}^{\\prime}\\,-\\,\\left(\\theta_{1}\\,+\\,\\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\right)\\,=\\,\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\\\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\theta_{1}\\,=\\,180^{\\circ}\\,-\\,\\theta_{2}^{\\prime}\\,+\\,\\phi_{1}^{\\prime}\\,=\\,180^{\\circ}\\,-\\,\\theta_{2}\\,+\\,\\phi_{1}\n$$  \n\nThe angle of departure is then  \n\n$$\n\\theta_{1}=180^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~-~}\\theta_{2}+\\phi_{1}=180^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~-~}90^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~+~}55^{\\circ}=145^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical diagram, likely related to signal processing or control theory. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top section and the bottom section.\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n*   A graph with x-axis labeled \"s\" and y-axis labeled \"jω\".\n*   A curve is plotted on the graph, with points marked at:\n    *   s = -1\n    *   jω = 0\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n*   A table with three columns:\n    *   Column 1: s\n    *   Column 2: jω\n    *   Column 3: unknown variable ( likely a function or expression)\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The diagram appears to be related to the Laplace transform, which is a mathematical tool used in signal processing and control theory.\n*   The curve plotted on the graph may represent a transfer function or a frequency response.\n*   The table at the bottom of the diagram suggests that there are multiple variables involved in the calculation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical diagram related to signal processing or control theory. The diagram includes a graph with a curve and a table with three columns, suggesting that there are multiple variables involved in the calculation. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the specific purpose or meaning of the diagram. 6–9 Determination of the angle of departure.  \n\nSince the root locus is symmetric about the real axis, the angle of departure from the pole at $s=-p_{2}$ is $-145^{\\circ}$ .  \n\n3. Determine the break-in point. A break-in point exists where a pair of root-locus branches coalesces as $K$ is increased. For this problem, the break-in point can be found as follows: Since  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,\\frac{s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,3}{s\\,+\\,2}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d K}{d s}=-\\,\\frac{(2s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,2)\\,-\\,\\bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,3\\bigr)}{(s\\,+\\,2)^{2}}=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwhich gives  \n\n$$\ns^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,1\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ns=-3.7320\\qquad\\mathrm{or}\\qquad s=-0.2680\n$$  \n\nNotice that point $s\\,=\\,-3.7320$ is on the root locus. Hence this point is an actual break-in point. (Note that at point $s\\,=\\,-3.7320$ the corresponding gain value is $K\\,=\\,5.4641.$ .) Since point $s=-0.2680$ is not on the root locus, it cannot be a break-in point. (For point $s=-0.2680$ ,the corresponding gain value is $K=-1.4641.$ )  \n\n4. Sketch a root-locus plot, based on the information obtained in the foregoing steps . To determine accurate root loci, several points must be found by trial and error between the breakin point and the complex open-loop poles. (To facilitate sketching the root-locus plot, we should find the direction in which the test point should be moved by mentally summing up the changes on the angles of the poles and zeros.) Figure 6–10 shows a complete root-locus plot for the system considered.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two intersecting lines, accompanied by various symbols and labels. The purpose of the graph is to illustrate the relationship between two variables.\n\n* A graph with two intersecting lines:\n\t+ The intersection point is marked with an \"x\" symbol.\n\t+ The lines are labeled with mathematical equations: $y = 2x + 3$ and $y = x - 1$.\n\t+ The graph also includes a third line, not intersecting at the origin, which appears to be a tangent to one of the intersecting lines.\n* A label for the x-axis:\n\t+ The axis is labeled with the symbol \"x\" and has a value range from -5 to 5.\n* A label for the y-axis:\n\t+ The axis is labeled with the symbol \"y\" and has a value range from -5 to 5.\n\nThe graph illustrates the intersection of two lines, along with additional information about their equations and properties. 6–10 Root-locus plot.  \n\nThe value of the gain $K$ at any point on root locus can be found by applying the magnitude 1 1 condition or by use of MATLAB (see Section 6–3). For example, the value of $K$ at which the complex-conjugate closed-loop poles have the damping ratio $\\zeta=0.7$ can be found by locating the roots, as shown in Figure 6–10, and computing the value of $K$ as follows:  \n\n$$\nK=\\left|\\frac{(s+1-j\\sqrt{2})(s+1+j\\sqrt{2})}{s+2}\\right|_{s=-1.67+j1.70}=1.34\n$$  \n\nOr use MATLAB to find the value of $K$ . (See Section 6–4.)  \n\nIt is noted that in this system the root locus in the complex plane is a part of a circle. Such a circular root locus will not occur in most systems. Circular root loci may occur in systems that involve two poles and one zero, two poles and two zeros, or one pole and two zeros. Even in such systems, whether circular root loci occur depends on the locations of poles and zeros involved.  \n\nTo show the occurrence of a circular root locus in the present system, we need to derive the equation for the root locus. For the present system, the angle condition is  \n\n$$\n/s\\,+\\,2\\,-\\,\\left/s\\,+\\,1\\,-\\,j\\sqrt{2}\\,-\\,\\left/s\\,+\\,1\\,+\\,j\\sqrt{2}\\,=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\\right.\n$$  \n\nIf $s=\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega$ is substituted into this last equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\n/\\sigma\\,+\\,2\\,+\\,j\\omega\\,-\\,/\\sigma\\,+\\,1\\,+\\,j\\omega\\,-\\,j\\sqrt{2}\\,-\\,/\\sigma\\,+\\,1\\,+\\,j\\omega\\,+\\,j\\sqrt{2}=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\n$$  \n\nwhich can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\right)\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,+\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,+\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,+\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,=\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\right)\\,\\pm\\,180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\n$$  \n\nTaking tangents of both sides of this last equation using the relationship  \n\n$$\n\\tan(x\\,\\pm\\,y)={\\frac{\\tan x\\,\\pm\\,\\tan y}{1\\,\\mp\\,\\tan x\\tan y}}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\n\\tan\\left[\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,+\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,+\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,\\right]\\,=\\,\\tan\\left[\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\right)\\,\\pm\\,180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\\right]\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\right)\\,=\\,-\\,17{\\sqrt{\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}\\,}}\\,\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,+\\,37{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\left({\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\right)\\,=\\,-\\,17{\\sqrt{\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}}\\,{\\sqrt{2}}\\,{\\sqrt{2}}\\,{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{{\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}+{\\frac{\\omega\\,+\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}}{1\\,-\\,{\\biggl(}{\\frac{\\omega\\,-\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}{\\biggr)}{\\biggl(}{\\frac{\\omega\\,+\\,{\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}}{\\biggr)}}}={\\frac{{\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\pm\\,0}{1\\,\\mp\\,{\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}}\\times0}}\n$$  \n\nwhich can be simplified to  \n\n$$\n\\frac{2\\omega(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)}{(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)^{2}\\,-\\,{\\left(\\omega^{2}\\,-\\,2\\right)}}=\\frac{\\omega}{\\sigma\\,+\\,2}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\omega\\big[(\\sigma\\,+\\,2\\,)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}\\,-\\,3\\big]\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThis last equation is equivalent to  \n\n$$\n\\omega\\,=\\,0\\qquad\\mathrm{or}\\qquad(\\sigma\\,+\\,2)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}\\,=\\,(\\sqrt{3})^{2}\n$$  \n\nThese two equations are the equations for the root loci for the present system. Notice that the first equation, $\\omega=0$ ,is the equation for the real axis. The real axis from $s=-2$ to $s=-\\infty$ corresponds to a root locus for $K\\ge0$ .The remaining part of the real axis corresponds to a root locus when $K$ is negative. (In the present system, $K$ is nonnegative.) (Note that $K<0$ corresponds to the positive-feedback case.) The second equation for the root locus is an equation of a circle with center at $\\sigma=-2$ ,$\\omega=0$ and the radius equal to $\\sqrt{3}\\,,$ .That part of the circle to the left of the complex-conjugate poles corresponds to a root locus for $K\\geq0$ .The remaining part of the circle corresponds to a root locus when $K$ is negative.  \n\nIt is important to note that easily interpretable equations for the root locus can be derived for simple systems only. For complicated systems having many poles and zeros, any attempt to derive equations for the root loci is discouraged. Such derived equations are very complicated and their configuration in the complex plane is difficult to visualize.  \n\nGeneral Rules for Constructing Root Loci. For a complicated system with many open-loop poles and zeros, constructing a root-locus plot may seem complicated, but actually it is not difficult if the rules for constructing the root loci are applied. By locating particular points and asymptotes and by computing angles of departure from complex poles and angles of arrival at complex zeros, we can construct the general form of the root loci without difficulty.  \n\nWe shall now summarize the general rules and procedure for constructing the root loci of the negative feedback control system shown in Figure 6–11.  \n\nFirst, obtain the characteristic equation  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThen rearrange this equation so that the parameter of interest appears as the multiplying factor in the form  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,{\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,z_{1})(s\\,+\\,z_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,z_{m})}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})}}=0\n$$  \n\nIn the present discussions, we assume that the parameter of interest is the gain $K$ , where $K>0$ .(If $K<0$ ,which corresponds to the positive-feedback case, the angle condition must be modified. See Section 6–4.) Note, however, that the method is still applicable to systems with parameters of interest other than gain. (See Section 6–6.)  \n\n1. Locate the poles and zeros of $G(s)H(s)$ on the splane.The root-locus branches start from open-loop poles and terminate at zeros (finite zeros or zeros at infinity). factored form of the open-loop transfer function, locate the open-loop poles and zeros in the $s$ plane. CNote that the open-loo os are the zeros $G(s)H(s)$ D,From the while the closed-loop zeros consist of the zeros of $G(s)$ and the poles of $H(s)$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is used to analyze and design feedback control systems. The diagram consists of several blocks that represent different components of the system.\n\n*   **Input (R(s))**: This block represents the input signal to the system.\n*   **Controller (G(s))**: This block represents the controller, which is a mathematical model of the controller's behavior.\n*   **Plant (H(s))**: This block represents the plant, which is the physical system being controlled.\n*   **Output (C(s))**: This block represents the output signal of the system.\n\nThe diagram shows how the input signal flows through the controller and then to the plant. The output of the plant is fed back to the controller, which adjusts its control action based on the error between the desired output and the actual output. This feedback loop allows the system to track changes in the setpoint or disturbance and maintain stability.\n\nThe diagram provides a visual representation of the control system's architecture and how it operates. It helps engineers and researchers understand the behavior of the system, identify potential issues, and design improvements.  \n\nNote that the root loci are symmetrical about the real axis of the $s$ plane, because the complex poles and complex zeros occur only in conjugate pairs.  \n\nA root-locus plot will have just as many branches as there are roots of the characteristic equation. Since the number of open-loop poles generally exceeds that of zeros, the number of branches equals that of poles. If the number of closed-loop poles is the same as the number of open-loop poles, then the number of individual root-locus branches terminating at finite open-loop zeros is equal to the number $_m$ of the open-loop zeros. The remaining $n\\,-\\,m$ branches terminate at infinity $(n\\mathrm{~-~}m$ implicit zeros at infinity) along asymptotes.  \n\nIf we include poles and zeros at infinity, the number of open-loop poles is equal to that of open-loop zeros. Hence we can always state that the root loci start at the poles of $G(s)H(s)$ and end at the zeros of $G(s)H(s)$ ,as $K$ increases from zero to infinity, where the poles and zeros include both those in the finite $s$ plane and those at infinity.  \n\n2. Determine the root loci on the real axis. Root loci on the real axis are determined by open-loop poles and zeros lying on it. The complex-conjugate poles and complexconjugate zeros of the open-loop transfer function have no effect on the location of the root loci on the real axis because the angle contribution of a pair of complex-conjugate poles or complex-conjugate zeros is $360^{\\circ}$ on the real axis. Each portion of the root locus on the real axis extends over a range from a pole or zero to another pole or zero. In constructing the root loci on the real axis, choose a test point on it. If the total number of real poles and real zeros to the right of this test point is odd, then this point lies on a root locus. If the open-loop poles and open-loop zeros are simple poles and simple zeros, then the root locus and its complement form alternate segments along the real axis.  \n\n3. Determine the asymptotes of root loci. If the test point $s$ is located far from the origin,then the angle of each complex quantity may be considered the same.One open-loop zero and one open-loop pole then cancel the effects of the other. Therefore, the root loci for very large values of $s$ must be asymptotic to straight lines whose angles (slopes) are given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Angles~of~asymptotes}={\\frac{\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)}{n\\,-\\,m}}\\qquad(k\\,=\\,0,1,2,\\dots)\n$$  \n\nwhere $n=$ number of finite poles of $G(s)H(s)$  \n\nHere, $k\\,=\\,0$ corresponds to the asymptotes with the smallest angle with the real axis.Although $k$ assumes an infinite number of values, as $k$ is increased the angle repeats itself, and the number of distinct asymptotes is $n\\,-\\,m$ .  \n\nAll the asymptotes intersect at a point on the real axis. The point at which they do so is obtained as follows:If both the numerator and denominator of the open-loop transfer function are expanded, the result is  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K[s^{m}+(z_{1}+z_{2}+\\cdots+z_{m})s^{m-1}+\\cdots+z_{1}z_{2}\\cdots z_{m}]}{s^{n}+(p_{1}+p_{2}+\\cdots+p_{n})s^{n-1}+\\cdots+p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{n}}}\n$$  \n\nIf a test point is located very far from the origin, then by dividing the denominator by the numerator, it is possible to write $G(s)H(s)$ as  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)=\\frac{K}{s^{n-m}+[(p_{1}+p_{2}+\\cdots+\\,p_{n})-(z_{1}+\\,z_{2}+\\cdots+\\,z_{m})]s^{n-m-1}+\\cdots]}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K}{\\left[s+{\\frac{\\left(p_{1}+p_{2}+\\cdots+p_{n}\\right)-\\left(z_{1}+z_{2}+\\cdots+z_{m}\\right)}{n-m}}\\right]^{n-m}}}\n$$  \n\nThe abscissa of the intersection of the asymptotes and the real axis is then obtained by setting the denominator of the right-hand side of Equation (6–12) equal to zero and solving for $s$ ,or  \n\n$$\ns=-{\\frac{\\left(p_{1}+p_{2}+\\cdots+p_{n}\\right)-\\left(z_{1}+z_{2}+\\cdots+z_{m}\\right)}{n-m}}\n$$  \n\n[Example 6–1 shows why Equation (6–13) gives the intersection.] Once this intersection is determined, the asymptotes can be readily drawn in the complex plane.  \n\nIt is important to note that the asymptotes show the behavior of the root loci for $|s|\\gg1$ .A root-locus branch may lie on one side of the corresponding asymptote or may cross the corresponding asymptote from one side to the other side.  \n\n4. Find the breakaway and break-in points. Because of the conjugate symmetry of the root loci, the breakaway points and break-in points either lie on the real axis or occur in complex-conjugate pairs.  \n\nIf a root locus lies between two adjacent open-loop poles on the real axis, then there exists at least one breakaway point between the two poles. Similarly, if the root locus lies between two adjacent zeros (one zero may be located at $-\\infty$ ) on the real axis, then there always exists at least one break-in point between the two zeros. If the root locus lies between an open-loop pole and a zero (finite or infinite) on the real axis, then there may exist no breakaway or break-in points or there may exist both breakaway and break-in points.  \n\nSuppose that the characteristic equation is given by  \n\n$$\nB(s)\\,+\\,K A(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe breakaway points and break-in points correspond to multiple roots of the characteristic equation.Hence,as discussed in Example 6–1,the breakaway and break-in points can be determined from the roots of  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d K}{d s}}=-\\,{\\frac{B^{\\prime}(s)A(s)\\,-\\,B(s)A^{\\prime}(s)}{A^{2}(s)}}=0\n$$  \n\nwhere the prime indicates differentiation with respect to $s_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\cdot}$ . It is important to note that the breakaway points and break-in points must be the roots of Equation (6–14), but not all roots of Equation (6–14) are breakaway or break-in points. If a real root of Equation (6–14) lies on the root-locus portion of the real axis, then it is an actual breakaway or break-in point. If a real root of Equation (6–14) is not on the root-locus portion of the real axis, then this root corresponds to neither a breakaway point nor a break-in point.  \n\nIf two roots $s\\implies s_{1}$ and $s=-s_{1}$ of Equation (6–14) are a complex-conjugate pair and if it is not certain whether they are on root loci, then it is necessary to check the corresponding $K$ value. If the value of $K$ corresponding to a root $s\\implies s_{1}$ of $d K/d s=0$ is positive, point $s\\implies s_{1}$ is an actual breakaway or break-in point. (Since $K$ is assumed to be nonnegative, if the value of $K$ thus obtained is negative, or a complex quantity, then point $s\\implies s_{1}$ is neither a breakaway nor a break-in point.)  \n\n5. Determine the angle of departure (angle of arrival) of the root locus from a complex pole (at a complex zero). To sketch the root loci with reasonable accuracy, we must find the directions of the root loci near the complex poles and zeros.If a test point is chosen and moved in the very vicinity of a complex pole (or complex zero), the sum of the angular contributions from all other poles and zeros can be considered to remain the same. Therefore, the angle of departure (or angle of arrival) of the root locus from a complex pole (or at a complex zero) can be found by subtracting from $180^{\\circ}$ the sum of all the angles of vectors from all other poles and zeros to the complex pole (or complex zero) in question, with appropriate signs included.  \n\nAngle of departure from a complex pole $=180^{\\circ}$   \n–(sum of the angles of vectors to a complex pole in question from other poles)   \n$^+$ (sum of the angles of vectors to a complex pole in question from zeros)   \nAngle of arrival at a complex zero $=180^{\\circ}$   \n–(sum of the angles of vectors to a complex zero in question from other zeros)   \n$^+$ (sum of the angles of vectors to a complex zero in question from poles)  \n\nThe angle of departure is shown in Figure 6–12.  \n\n6. Find the points where the root loci may cross the imaginary axis. The points where the root loci intersect the $j\\omega$ axis can be found easily by (a) use of Routh’s stability criterion or (b) letting $s=j\\omega$ in the characteristic equation,equating both the real part and the imaginary part to zero, and solving for $\\omega$ and $K$ .The values of $\\omega$ thus found give the frequencies at which root loci cross the imaginary axis. The $K$ value corresponding to each crossing frequency gives the gain at the crossing point.  \n\n7. Taking a series of test points in the broad neighborhood of the origin of the splane, sketch the root loci. Determine the root loci in the broad neighborhood of the $j\\omega$ axis and the origin. The most important part of the root loci is on neither the real axis nor the asymptotes but is in the broad neighborhood of the $j\\omega$ axis and the origin.The shape of the root loci in this important region in the $s$ plane must be obtained with reasonable accuracy.(If accurate shape of the root loci is needed,MATLAB may be used rather than hand calculations of the exact shape of the root loci.)  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, the x-axis and y-axis. The x-axis is labeled with a single letter \"σ\" at its end, while the y-axis lacks any labels or markings.\n\nA line extends from the origin (0, 0) to the upper right quadrant of the graph, terminating at a point marked with an arrow pointing towards the top-right corner. This point is accompanied by the notation \"Angle of departure.\"\n\nIn the bottom-left quadrant of the graph, there are two additional lines that intersect at a single point located below the x-axis. The left line originates from the origin and terminates at this intersection point, which is marked with an arrow pointing towards the top-right corner. This point bears the label \"θ1.\"\n\nThe right line, also originating from the origin, intersects with the first mentioned point in the bottom-left quadrant. It is labeled as \"θ2\" and features an arrow pointing towards the lower right.\n\nNotably, all three points are marked with small arrows pointing towards them.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a graph with two axes, featuring various lines and labels that indicate angles of departure and intersection points within different quadrants. 6–12 Construction of the root locus. [Angle of departure $=180^{\\circ}$ -$(\\theta_{1}\\,+\\,\\theta_{2})\\,+\\,\\phi.]$  \n\n8. Determine closed-loop poles. A particular point on each root-locus branch will be a closed-loop pole if the value of $K$ at that point satisfies the magnitude condition. Conversely, the magnitude condition enables us to determine the value of the gain $K$ at any specific root location on the locus. (If necessary, the root loci may be graduated in terms of $K$ .The root loci are continuous with $K$ .)  \n\nThe value of $K$ corresponding to any point $s$ on a root locus can be obtained using the magnitude condition, or  \n\n$$\nK={\\frac{\\mathrm{product~of~lengths~between~point~}}{\\mathrm{product~of~lengths~between~point~}}}*\\mathrm{to~poles}\n$$  \n\nThis value can be evaluated either graphically or analytically. (MATLAB can be used for graduating the root loci with $K$ . See Section 6–3.)  \n\nIf the gain $K$ of the open-loop transfer function is given in the problem, then by applying the magnitude condition, we can find the correct locations of the closed-loop poles for a given $K$ on each branch of the root loci by a trial-and-error approach or by use of MATLAB, which will be presented in Section 6–3.  \n\nComments on the Root-Locus Plots. It is noted that the characteristic equation of the negative feedback control system whose open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K(s^{m}+b_{1}s^{m-1}+\\cdots+b_{m})}{s^{n}+a_{1}s^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n}}}\\qquad(n\\geq m)\n$$  \n\nis an nth-degree algebraic equation in $s.$ . If the order of the numerator of $G(s)H(s)$ is lower than that of the denominator by two or more (which means that there are two or more zeros at infinity), then the coefficient $a_{1}$ is the negative sum of the roots of the equation and is independent of $K$ . In such a case, if some of the roots move on the locus toward the left as $K$ is increased, then the other roots must move toward the right as $K$ is increased.This information is helpful in finding the general shape of the root loci.  \n\nIt is also noted that a slight change in the pole–zero configuration may cause significant changes in the root-locus configurations. Figure 6–13 demonstrates the fact that a slight change in the location of a zero or pole will make the root-locus configuration look quite different.  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical concept, likely related to signal processing or control theory. The visual representation features two graphs with distinct characteristics.\n\n**Graph 1:**\n\n*   **Shape:** The graph is shaped like an \"S,\" indicating a sinusoidal pattern.\n*   **Axes:** The x-axis represents time (t), while the y-axis represents amplitude (A).\n*   **Function:** The function represented by this graph appears to be a simple sine wave, oscillating between positive and negative values.\n\n**Graph 2:**\n\n*   **Shape:** This graph exhibits a more complex shape, resembling an \"M\" or a \"W.\"\n*   **Axes:** The x-axis represents time (t), while the y-axis represents amplitude (A).\n*   **Function:** The function represented by this graph seems to be a combination of two sinusoidal waves with different frequencies and amplitudes.\n\n**Common Features:**\n\n*   Both graphs have similar scales on their axes.\n*   They share the same color scheme, which could indicate a relationship between the two functions.\n*   The x-axis ranges from -10π to 10π, suggesting that the functions are periodic and repeat every 2π units of time.\n\n**Context:**\n\n*   The image may be related to signal processing or control theory, as it involves mathematical representations of signals and their transformations.\n*   The use of sinusoidal waves suggests an application in audio engineering, telecommunications, or electrical engineering.\n*   The presence of two graphs with different shapes could indicate a comparison between two different signal processing techniques or methods.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image presents a visual representation of two mathematical functions related to signal processing. While the exact context and application are unclear without additional information, it is evident that the graph represents sinusoidal patterns, which are common in many fields of engineering. 6–13 Root-locus plots.  \n\nCancellation of Poles of $G(s)$ with Zeros of $H(s)$ .It is important to note that if the denominator of $G(s)$ and the numerator of $H(s)$ involve common factors, then the corresponding open-loop poles and zeros will cancel each other, reducing the degree of the characteristic equation by one or more. For example, consider the system shown in Figure 6–14(a). (This system has velocity feedback.) By modifying the block diagram of Figure 6–14(a) to that shown in Figure 6–14(b), it is clearly seen that $G(s)$ and $H(s)$ have a common factor $s\\,+\\,1.$ .The closed-loop transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)\\,+\\,K(s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n\\lceil s(s\\,+\\,2)\\,+\\,K\\rceil(s\\,+\\,1)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nBecause of the cancellation of the terms $(s+1)$ appearing in $G(s)$ and $H(s)$ ,however, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\ 1\\ +\\ G(s)H(s)=1\\,-\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,1)}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}&{{}}\\\\ {\\ =\\frac{s(s\\,+\\,2)\\,+\\,K}{s(s\\,+\\,2)}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe reduced characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\ns(s\\,+\\,2)\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe root-locus plot of $G(s)H(s)$ does not show all the roots of the characteristic equation, only the roots of the reduced equation.  \n\nTo obtain the complete set of closed-loop poles, we must add the canceled pole of $G(s)H(s)$ to those closed-loop poles obtained from the root-locus plot of $G(s)H(s)$ .The important thing to remember is that the canceled pole of $G(s)H(s)$ is a closed-loop pole of the system, as seen from Figure 6–14(c).  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram featuring three distinct control systems, labeled (a), (b), and (c). Each system comprises various components, including blocks with arrows connecting them, indicating signal flow.\n\n*   **System (a)**\n    *   This system consists of two input signals: R(s) and H(s).\n    *   The output is denoted as C(s).\n    *   The block labeled K(s+1)(s+2) represents a transfer function.\n    *   An integrator block with the equation s/(s+1) is also present.\n*   **System (b)**\n    *   This system has two input signals: R(s) and H(s).\n    *   The output is denoted as C(s).\n    *   The block labeled K(s+1)(s+2) represents a transfer function.\n    *   An integrator block with the equation s/(s+1) is also present.\n*   **System (c)**\n    *   This system has two input signals: R(s) and H(s).\n    *   The output is denoted as C(s).\n    *   The block labeled K(s+1)(s+2) represents a transfer function.\n    *   An integrator block with the equation s/(s+1) is also present.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates three control systems, each consisting of input signals, transfer functions, and integrator blocks. These systems are designed to process and manipulate various signals within them. 6–14 (a) Control system with velocity feedback; (b) and (c) modified block diagrams.  \n\nTypical Pole–Zero Configurations and Corresponding Root Loci. In summarizing, we show several open-loop pole–zero configurations and their corresponding root loci in Table 6–1.The pattern of the root loci depends only on the relative separation of the open-loop poles and zeros. If the number of open-loop poles exceeds the number of finite zeros by three or more, there is a value of the gain $K$ beyond which root loci enter the right-half $s$ plane, and thus the system can become unstable.A stable system must have all its closed-loop poles in the left-half $s$ plane.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of 12 graphs, each with its own unique characteristics. The graphs are arranged in three rows of four, and they appear to be related to mathematical concepts or functions.\n\nHere is a detailed description of each graph:\n\n*   **Top-left graph:**\n    *   This graph features a curved line that opens upwards, resembling an inverted parabola.\n    *   The curve has two distinct points where it intersects with the x-axis.\n    *   There are no visible labels or markings on this graph.\n*   **Top-center graph:**\n    *   This graph displays a series of connected arcs, forming a circular shape.\n    *   Each arc is labeled with an \"x\" at its midpoint, and there are arrows pointing towards the center of the circle.\n    *   The background of this graph has a subtle grid pattern.\n*   **Top-right graph:**\n    *   This graph shows a complex network of lines and curves, including some that resemble waves or ripples.\n    *   There are several symbols scattered throughout the graph, including \"x\", \"$\\sigma$\", and \"$j\\omega$\".\n    *   The background of this graph is white, providing good contrast for the dark-colored lines and symbols.\n*   **Middle-left graph:**\n    *   This graph features a single curved line that opens downwards, similar to an ordinary parabola.\n    *   There are two distinct points where the curve intersects with the x-axis.\n    *   The background of this graph has a faint grid pattern.\n*   **Middle-center graph:**\n    *   This graph displays a series of connected arcs, forming a circular shape similar to the top-center graph.\n    *   Each arc is labeled with an \"x\" at its midpoint, and there are arrows pointing towards the center of the circle.\n    *   The background of this graph has a subtle grid pattern.\n*   **Middle-right graph:**\n    *   This graph shows a complex network of lines and curves, including some that resemble waves or ripples.\n    *   There are several symbols scattered throughout the graph, including \"x\", \"$\\sigma$\", and \"$j\\omega$\".\n    *   The background of this graph is white, providing good contrast for the dark-colored lines and symbols.\n*   **Bottom-left graph:**\n    *   This graph features a curved line that opens upwards, similar to an inverted parabola.\n    *   There are two distinct points where the curve intersects with the x-axis.\n    *   The background of this graph has a faint grid pattern.\n*   **Bottom-center graph:**\n    *   This graph displays a series of connected arcs, forming a circular shape similar to the top-center and middle-center graphs.\n    *   Each arc is labeled with an \"x\" at its midpoint, and there are arrows pointing towards the center of the circle.\n    *   The background of this graph has a subtle grid pattern.\n*   **Bottom-right graph:**\n    *   This graph shows a complex network of lines and curves, including some that resemble waves or ripples.\n    *   There are several symbols scattered throughout the graph, including \"x\", \"$\\sigma$\", and \"$j\\omega$\".\n    *   The background of this graph is white, providing good contrast for the dark-colored lines and symbols.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a diverse collection of graphs, each with its unique characteristics. While some graphs display simple curves or arcs, others feature complex networks of lines and curves. The use of different colors, symbols, and backgrounds adds visual interest to the graphs, making them easier to analyze and understand.  \n\nNote that once we have some experience with the method,we can easily evaluate the changes in the root loci due to the changes in the number and location of the open-loop poles and zeros by visualizing the root-locus plots resulting from various pole–zero configurations.  \n\nSummary. From the preceding discussions, it should be clear that it is possible to sketch a reasonably accurate root-locus diagram for a given system by following simple rules. (The reader should study the various root-locus diagrams shown in the solved problems at the end of the chapter.) At preliminary design stages, we may not need the precise locations of the closed-loop poles. Often their approximate locations are all that is needed to make an estimate of system performance. Thus, it is important that the designer have the capability of quickly sketching the root loci for a given system.  \n\n# 6–3 PLOTTING ROOT LOCI WITH MATLAB  \n\nIn this section we present the MATLAB approach to the generation of root-locus plots and finding relevant information from the root-locus plots.  \n\nPlotting Root Loci with MATLAB. In plotting root loci with MATLAB we deal with the system equation given in the form of Equation (6–11), which may be written as  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,K\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{num}}{\\mathrm{den}}=0\n$$  \n\nwhere num is the numerator polynomial and den is the denominator polynomial. That is,  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\mathrm{num}}=(s\\,+\\,z_{1})(s\\,+\\,z_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,z_{m})}\\\\ &{\\qquad=s^{m}+\\,{\\bigl(}z_{1}\\,+\\,z_{2}\\,+\\,\\cdots+\\,z_{m}{\\bigr)}s^{m-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots+\\,z_{1}z_{2}\\cdots z_{m}}\\\\ &{{\\mathrm{den}}=(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})}\\\\ &{\\qquad=s^{n}\\,+\\,{\\bigl(}p_{1}\\,+\\,p_{2}+\\cdots+\\,p_{n}{\\bigr)}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots+\\,p_{1}p_{2}\\cdots p_{m}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nNote that both vectors num and den must be written in descending powers of $s$ .  \n\nA MATLAB command commonly used for plotting root loci is  \n\nUsing this command, the root-locus plot is drawn on the screen.The gain vector Kis automatically determined. (The vector Kcontains all the gain values for which the closedloop poles are to be computed.)  \n\nFor the systems defined in state space, rlocus(A,B,C,D) plots the root locus of the system with the gain vector automatically determined.  \n\nNote that commands  \n\nuse the user-supplied gain vector K.  \n\nIf it is desired to plot the root loci with marks $^{\\prime}\\mathrm{o}^{\\prime}$ or $\"X\"$ , it is necessary to use the following command:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathsf{r}=\\mathsf{r}|\\mathrm{ocus}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{p l o t}(\\Gamma,\\mathrm{^{\\prime}O^{\\prime}})\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{or}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\mathsf{p l o t}(\\Gamma,\\mathrm{^{\\prime}x^{\\prime}})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nPlotting root loci using marks oor $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}$ is instructive, since each calculated closed-loop pole is graphically shown; in some portion of the root loci those marks are densely placed and in another portion of the root loci they are sparsely placed.MATLAB supplies its own set of gain values used to calculate a root-locus plot. It does so by an internal adaptive stepsize routine.Also,MATLAB uses the automatic axis-scaling feature of the plot command.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 6–3  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 6–15. Plot root loci with a square aspect ratio so that a line with slope 1 is a true $45^{\\circ}$ line. Choose the region of root-locus plot to be  \n\n$$\n-6\\leq x\\leq6,\\qquad-6\\leq y\\leq6\n$$  \n\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are the real-axis coordinate and imaginary-axis coordinate, respectively. To set the given plot region on the screen to be square, enter the command  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{\\Deltav=[-6\\,\\,\\,6\\,\\,\\,-6\\,\\,\\,6]\\,;\\,axis\\,\\,(v);\\,axis(^{\\prime}s q u a r e^{\\prime})}\n$$  \n\nWith this command, the region of the plot is as specified and a line with slope 1 is at a true $45^{\\circ}$ ,not skewed by the irregular shape of the screen.  \n\nFor this problem, the denominator is given as a product of first- and second-order terms. So we must multiply these terms to get a polynomial in $s$ .The multiplication of these terms can be done easily by use of the convolution command, as shown next.  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\mathrm{a}=\\mathrm{s}\\;(\\mathrm{s}+\\,1);\\;\\;}}&{{\\mathrm{a}=[1\\;\\;\\;1\\;\\;\\;0]}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{b}=\\mathrm{s}^{2}+\\,4\\mathrm{s}+\\,1\\,6;\\;\\;}}&{{\\mathrm{b}=[1\\;\\;\\;4\\;\\;\\;1\\,6]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen we use the following command:  \n\n$$\n{\\mathsf{c}}=\\mathsf{c o n v}({\\mathsf{a}},\\,{\\mathsf{b}})\n$$  \n\nNote that $\\mathsf{c o n v}(\\mathsf{a},\\mathsf{b})$ gives the product of two polynomials a and b.See the following computer output:  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation, specifically a matrix multiplication problem, with variables and constants.

The use of arrows and symbols helps to clarify the sequence of operations involved, making it easier to understand the mathematical transformations being applied to the original equation. 6–15 Control system.  \n\nTo find the complex-conjugate open-loop poles (the roots of $s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,16\\,=\\,0$ ), we may enter the roots command as follows:  \n\nThus, the system has the following open-loop zero and open-loop poles:  \n\nOpen-loop zero: $s=-3$  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,0,\\quad s\\,=\\,-1,\\quad s\\,=\\,-2\\,\\pm\\,j3.4641\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 6–1 will plot the root-locus diagram for this system.

The program is titled \"MATLAB Program 6-1\" and has a white background.\n\n*   The title of the program is displayed at the top.\n    *   It reads \"MATLAB Program 6-1\".\n*   Below the title, there are several lines of code that define the parameters for the root-locus plot.\n    *   The first line defines the number of poles and zeros in the system.\n    *   The second line defines the transfer function of the system.\n    *   The third line defines the input signal to the system.\n*   Below the code, there is a grid that represents the root-locus plot.\n    *   The x-axis represents the real part of the complex plane.\n    *   The y-axis represents the imaginary part of the complex plane.\n    *   The grid lines are spaced evenly apart, with labels indicating the magnitude of each point on the axis.\n\nOverall, the image shows a simple root-locus plot generated using MATLAB. The program defines the parameters for the plot and then displays the resulting graph.  \n\nNote that in MATLAB Program 6–1, instead of  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{den}=[1\\;\\;5\\;\\;20\\;\\;16\\;\\;0]\n$$  \n\nwe may enter  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{den}=\\mathsf{c o n v}\\left([1\\;\\;\\;1\\;\\;\\;0],\\;[1\\;\\;\\;4\\;\\;\\;1\\,6]\\right)\n$$  \n\nThe results are the same.  \n\nThe image presents a root-locus plot of G(s) = K(s + 3)/[s(s + 1)(s^2 + 4s + 16)], which is a graphical representation used to analyze and design control systems. The plot displays the behavior of the system's poles as the gain parameter K varies.\n\n*   **Plot Title**: Root-Locus Plot\n    *   This indicates that the graph represents how the roots (poles) of the closed-loop transfer function change with respect to a single variable, in this case, the gain K.\n*   **Axes**:\n    *   The x-axis represents the real axis of the complex plane, and the y-axis represents the imaginary axis.\n    *   The plot spans from -6 on the left (negative real axis) to 6 on the right (positive real axis), with tick marks at intervals of 2 units. On the vertical axis, the tick marks are spaced at intervals of 4 units.\n*   **Root-Locus**: This plot shows how the poles of the closed-loop transfer function move as the gain K changes from very small values to larger ones.\n    *   The root-locus starts at the origin (0,0) and ends at infinity.\n    *   It has branches that extend into each quadrant of the complex plane, indicating where the poles are located for different values of K.\n    *   Some parts of the locus have X's marked on them, possibly representing specific gain values or points of interest in the design process.\n*   **Other Features**:\n    *   There is no legend or key provided to explain what the different marks or symbols represent. Without additional context or information about these markers, their significance cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nIn summary, the root-locus plot illustrates how the poles of a closed-loop control system change as the gain parameter K varies, offering insights into stability and performance characteristics. The exact meaning of certain features on the plot requires further clarification from the original source or additional context not provided in the image description. 6–16 Root-locus plot.   \nChapter 6 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Root-Locus Method  \n\nEXAMPLE 6–4 Consider the negative feedback system whose open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{G(s)H(s)=\\displaystyle\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,0.5)\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,0.6s\\,+\\,10\\right)}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{K}{s^{4}\\,+\\,1.1s^{3}\\,+\\,10.3s^{2}\\,+\\,5s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThere are no open-loop zeros. Open-loop poles are located at $s\\,=\\,-0.3\\,+\\,j3.1480$ ,$s\\,=\\,-0.3\\,-\\,j3.1480,s$ $s=-0.5$ ,and $s\\,=\\,0$ .  \n\nEntering MATLAB Program 6–2 into the computer, we obtain the root-locus plot shown in Figure 6–17.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for creating a root-locus plot of a transfer function. \n\n*   The program is written in the MATLAB language and includes comments to explain what each section of code does.\n*   It defines the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function as vectors.\n*   The `rlocus` command generates a root-locus plot for the given transfer function with default settings.\n\nThe image displays a simple program that creates a root-locus plot.  \n\nNotice that in the regions near $x\\,=\\,-0.3$ ,$y=2.3$ and $x\\,=\\,-0.3$ ,$y\\,=\\,-2.3$ two loci approach each other.We may wonder if these two branches should touch or not.To explore this situation, we may plot the root loci using smaller increments of $K$ in the critical region.  \n\nThe image presents a root locus plot, which is a graphical representation of the behavior of a control system's poles as a parameter (usually gain) varies. The plot shows how the roots of the characteristic equation move around the complex plane.\n\n*   **Title**: \"Root-Locus Plot of G(s)\"\n    *   The title indicates that this is a root locus plot for a transfer function or system described by the Laplace variable s.\n*   **Axes**:\n    *   Real Axis: The x-axis represents the real part of the complex plane, ranging from -6 to 6.\n    *   Imaginary Axis (not labeled): The y-axis represents the imaginary part of the complex plane, also ranging from -6 to 6.\n*   **Root Loci**:\n    *   Multiple root loci are visible, each indicating a path that the roots of the characteristic equation follow as the gain increases or decreases.\n    *   Some root loci start near the origin and move towards the right half of the complex plane.\n    *   Other root loci begin at infinity and approach the left half of the complex plane.\n*   **Gain Values**:\n    *   No explicit gain values are plotted on the axes; instead, they are implied by the movement of the root loci.\n    *   The gain influences the position of the root loci, with higher gains causing them to move further into the right half-plane.\n\nIn summary, this root locus plot illustrates how the poles of a system change in response to varying gains. The plot helps designers analyze and understand the stability characteristics of their systems without directly computing the roots of the characteristic equation for different gain values. 6–17 Root-locus plot.  \n\nFigure 6–18 Root-locus plot.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, the x-axis and y-axis, forming a coordinate system. The x-axis is labeled as the \"Real Axis\" on the bottom, while the y-axis is labeled as the \"Imaginary Axis\" on the left side of the graph.\n\n**Graph Features:**\n\n*   **Axes:** The x-axis ranges from -4 to 4 in increments of 1, whereas the y-axis ranges from -3.5 to 3.5 in increments of 0.5.\n*   **Grid Pattern:** A grid pattern is visible on both axes, with dotted lines connecting each tick mark to form a series of squares within the graph area.\n*   **Black Line Graph:** A black line extends across the entire width of the graph, originating from approximately (0, -1) and terminating near (4, 3.5). This line exhibits a slight curvature towards the upper right quadrant.\n*   **Circle Markers:** Small circles are scattered throughout the graph, primarily concentrated in specific regions around (-2, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0).\n*   **Background:** The background of the image is white.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a coordinate system with labeled axes and a grid pattern. A black line traverses the graph from left to right, while small circles are scattered throughout various regions within the graph.  \n\nBy a conventional trial-and-error approach or using the command rlocfind to be presented later in this section, we find the particular region of interest to be $20\\,\\leq\\,K\\,\\leq\\,30.$ . By entering MATLAB Program 6–3, we obtain the root-locus plot shown in Figure 6–18. From this plot, it is clear that the two branches that approach in the upper half-plane (or in the lower half-plane) do not touch.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program for creating a root locus plot, which is a graphical representation of the behavior of a control system's poles as a parameter varies. The program includes several lines of code that define the system's dynamics and parameters.\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   The title \"MATLAB Program 6-3\" is displayed at the top of the image.\n*   **Code**\n    *   The code defines a root locus plot with the following parameters:\n        *   num = [1 1.1 10.3 5]\n        *   den = [1 0.2 20]\n        *   K1 = 0:0.2:20\n        *   K2 = 20:0.1:30\n        *   K3 = 30:5:1000\n    *   The code uses the rlocus function to generate the root locus plot.\n*   **Plot**\n    *   The resulting root locus plot shows the poles of the system as a parameter (K) varies from 0 to 1000.\n    *   The plot indicates that the system's stability changes as K increases, with some poles moving towards the right half-plane and others moving towards the left half-plane.\n\nOverall, the image provides a clear and concise visual representation of the root locus plot generated by the MATLAB program.  \n\nEXAMPLE 6–5 Consider the system shown in Figure 6–19.The system equations are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {y=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}+D u}\\\\ {u=r-y}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a black-and-white diagram of a system, comprising various components and connections. The diagram is divided into two sections, each featuring distinct elements.\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n* A large rectangle dominates this section, labeled \"B\".\n* Two smaller rectangles are situated on either side of B, denoted as \"A\" and \"D\".\n* An arrow points from the leftmost edge of B towards the rightmost edge.\n* Additional arrows emanate from the top-right corner of B, connecting to other components in the diagram.\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n* A smaller rectangle is positioned centrally within this section, marked as \"C\".\n* Two larger rectangles flank C on either side, labeled \"r\" and \"u\".\n* An arrow points from the bottom-left edge of C towards the top-right corner.\n* Further arrows extend from the top-left corner of C, connecting to other elements in the diagram.\n\n**Common Elements:**\n\n* Throughout the diagram, various symbols are used to represent different connections:\n\t+ Arrows with a circle at one end indicate the flow of information between components.\n\t+ Rectangles with an \"X\" symbol inside denote specific functions or operations being performed.\n\t+ Lines without arrows signify the connection between components.\n\n**Background:**\n\n* The background of the diagram is plain white, providing a clean and neutral backdrop for the various elements to be displayed against. 6–19 Closed-loop control system.  \n\nIn this example problem we shall obtain the root-locus diagram of the system defined in state space.As an example let us consider the case where matrices A ,B,C, and $D$ are  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\phantom{-}0}&{\\phantom{-}1}&{0}\\\\ {\\phantom{-}0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-160}&{-56}&{-14}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\phantom{-}0}\\\\ {\\phantom{-}1}\\\\ {-14}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{C}=[1\\quad0\\quad0],}&{D=[0]}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThe root-locus plot for this system can be obtained with MATLAB by use of the following command:  \n\nThis command will produce the same root-locus plot as can be obtained by use of the rlocus (num,den) command, where num and den are obtained from  \n\n$$\n[\\mathrm{num},\\mathrm{den}]=\\mathrm{ss}2\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D})\n$$  \n\nas follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\mathsf{n u m}=[0\\;\\;0\\;\\;1\\;\\;0]}}\\\\ {{\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\;\\;14\\;\\;56\\;\\;160]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 6–4 is a program that will generate the root-locus plot as shown in Figure 6–20.  \n\nThe image shows a computer code for a root-locus plot. The title of the image is \"MATLAB Program 6-4.\" \n\n*   The code is written in MATLAB and includes several lines that define the parameters and variables used in the program.\n    *   The first line defines the system matrix A, which represents the coefficients of the transfer function.\n    *   The second line defines the input vector B, which represents the inputs to the system.\n    *   The third line defines the output vector C, which represents the outputs of the system.\n    *   The fourth line defines the direct feedthrough matrix D, which represents the direct relationship between the inputs and outputs.\n    *   The fifth line defines the state-space model using the ss() function from the control toolbox.\n    *   The sixth line plots the root locus of the system using the rlocus() function from the control toolbox.\n\nThe code generates a root-locus plot, which is a graphical representation of the stability and performance of a control system. The plot shows how the closed-loop poles (roots) of the system change as a parameter, typically the gain or feedback coefficient, varies.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"Real Axis\" and \"Imaginary Axis,\" which are commonly referred to as the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. The graph features:\n\n**Axes:**\n\n*   **Real Axis (x-axis):** Extends from -20 to 20, with values marked at intervals of 5.\n*   **Imaginary Axis (y-axis):** Also extends from -20 to 20, with values marked at intervals of 5.\n\n**Graph Features:**\n\n*   The graph displays two curves that intersect at a single point, located approximately in the middle of both axes. This intersection is denoted by an \"x\" symbol.\n*   One curve begins on the left side of the graph and moves upward towards the top-right corner, then turns downwards and ends near the bottom-left corner.\n*   The other curve starts near the center of the graph, moves upwards to the top-right corner, and then back down to the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Additional Notations:**\n\n*   A small circle surrounds the intersection point, where the two curves meet. This notation is typically used in mathematics to indicate a specific solution or value.\n*   There are no other notable features or annotations on the graph.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a simple graph with two intersecting curves on a Cartesian coordinate system, featuring labeled axes and a unique notation at their point of intersection. 6–20 Root-locus plot of system defined in state space, where A ,B,C, and $D$ are as given by Equation (6–15).  \n\nConstant $\\boldsymbol{\\zeta}$ Loci and Constant $\\pmb{\\omega}_{n}$ Loci. Recall that in the complex plane the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of a pair of complex-conjugate poles can be expressed in terms of the angle $\\phi$ , which is measured from the negative real axis, as shown in Figure 6–21(a) with  \n\n$$\n\\zeta\\,=\\,\\cos\\phi\n$$  \n\nIn other words, lines of constant damping ratio $\\zeta$ are radial lines passing through the origin as shown in Figure 6–21(b). For example, a damping ratio of 0.5 requires that the complex-conjugate poles lie on the lines drawn through the origin making angles of $\\pm60^{\\circ}$ with the negative real axis. (If the real part of a pair of complex-conjugate poles is positive, which means that the system is unstable, the corresponding $\\zeta$ is negative.) The damping ratio determines the angular location of the poles, while the distance of the pole from the origin is determined by the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ .The constant $\\omega_{n}$ loci are circles.  \n\nThe image presents two graphs, each with a distinct set of labels and axes. The first graph is labeled \"(a)\" and features a 2D coordinate system with x and y axes. The second graph is labeled \"(b)\" and also has a 2D coordinate system with x and y axes.\n\n**Graph (a)**\n\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   X-axis: Not explicitly labeled, but appears to represent the real part of a complex number.\n    *   Y-axis: Labeled as \"jω\", which represents the imaginary part of a complex number.\n*   **Labels:**\n    *   Top-left corner: \"X\" and \"Y\"\n    *   Bottom-right corner: \"0\"\n*   **Data Points:**\n    *   Several data points are plotted on the graph, but no specific values or labels are provided.\n\n**Graph (b)**\n\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   X-axis: Labeled as \"σ\", which represents a parameter related to stability.\n    *   Y-axis: Labeled as \"ωd\", which appears to represent an angular frequency or rate of change.\n*   **Labels:**\n    *   Top-left corner: \"0\"\n    *   Bottom-right corner: Not explicitly labeled, but appears to be the origin (0, 0).\n*   **Data Points:**\n    *   Several data points are plotted on the graph, but no specific values or labels are provided.\n\nIn summary, both graphs appear to represent complex systems or processes, with Graph (a) potentially showing the relationship between real and imaginary parts of a complex number, while Graph (b) may illustrate how stability changes over time. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to provide a definitive interpretation of these graphs. 6–21 (a) Complex poles; (b) lines of constant damping ratio $\\zeta$ .  \nChapter 6 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Root-Locus Method  \n\nTo draw constant $\\zeta$ lines and constant $\\omega_{n}$ circles on the root-locus diagram with MATLAB, use the command sgrid .  \n\n# Plotting Polar Grids in the Root-Locus Diagram.

The code defines a function called `sgrid` with three arguments: `v`, `axis(v)`, and `title`. The variable `v` is assigned the value of a vector containing two pairs of numbers, which likely define the range of values for a 3D plot. The function `axis(v)` appears to be used to set the axis limits for the plot.  \n\nIf only particular constant $\\zeta$ lines (such as the $\\zeta=0.5$ line and $\\zeta\\,=\\,0.707$ line) and particular constant $\\omega_{n}$ circles (such as the $\\omega_{n}\\,=\\,0.5$ circle, $\\omega_{n}=1$ circle, and $\\omega_{n}=2$ circle) are desired, use the following command:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{s g r i d}([0.5,\\ 0.707],\\ [0.5,\\ 1,\\ 2])\n$$  \n\nIf we wish to overlay lines of constant $\\zeta$ and circles of constant $\\omega_{n}$ as given above to a root-locus plot of a negative feedback system with  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{n u m}=[0\\;\\;0\\;\\;0\\;\\;1]}\\\\ {\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\;\\;4\\;\\;5\\;\\;0]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a graph featuring a complex number in the form of z = (0.34 + 0.16i), where i is an imaginary number representing the square root of -1. The real and imaginary parts are plotted on a coordinate system, with the x-axis representing the real part (Re) and the y-axis representing the imaginary part (Im). The graph's axes range from -3 to 3.\n\nThe graph displays numerous dotted lines radiating from the origin (0,0), indicating various magnitudes. These lines represent different values of |z| = √(Re^2 + Im^2), where Re is the real component and Im is the imaginary component of z. The magnitude |z| measures the distance of a complex number from the origin in the complex plane.\n\nAt the top right of the graph, a semi-circle with radius 1 is visible, serving as a guide to determine the value of |z|. This semi-circle corresponds to the equation |z| = 1.\n\nThe graph's background is white, and all text labels are black. The axes are labeled \"Re\" for the x-axis and \"Im\" for the y-axis in the upper-left corner. Additionally, the label \"z = (0.34 + 0.16i)\" appears at the bottom left of the graph.  \nConstant $\\zeta$ Lines and Constant $\\omega_{n}$ Circles   \nFigure 6–22 Constant $\\zeta$ lines and constant $\\omega_{n}$ circles.  \n\nthen enter MATLAB Program 6–6 into the computer. The resulting root-locus plot is shown in Figure 6–23.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB script that generates a root-locus plot for a given transfer function. The script is titled \"MATLAB Program 6-6\" and includes several lines of code that define the variables, parameters, and commands used to generate the plot.\n\n*   The first line defines the variable 'num' as an array [1 4 5 0], which represents the numerator of a transfer function.\n*   The second line defines the variable 'den' as an array [1 4 5 0], which represents the denominator of a transfer function.\n*   The third line defines the variable 'K' as a constant value of 1000, which is used to scale the transfer function.\n*   The fourth line uses the 'rlocus' command to generate a root-locus plot with respect to the parameter 'K'.\n*   The fifth line adds labels and titles to the plot using the 'xlabel', 'ylabel', and 'title' commands.\n*   The sixth line displays the plot.\n\nThe generated plot is a root-locus plot that shows how the poles of a transfer function change as the parameter 'K' varies from 0 to infinity. The plot includes several features such as:\n\n*   A grid with tick marks at regular intervals\n*   Labels and titles for the x-axis, y-axis, and plot title\n*   A legend or key that explains the meaning of different colors or symbols on the plot\n\nOverall, the script provides a clear and concise way to generate a root-locus plot for a given transfer function using MATLAB.  \n\nIf we want to omit either the entire constant $\\zeta$ lines or entire constant $\\omega_{n}$ circles, we may use empty brackets [] in the arguments of the sgrid command.For example,if we want to overlay only the constant damping ratio line corresponding to $\\zeta=0.5$ and no constant $\\omega_{n}$ circles on the root-locus plot, then we may use the command  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two intersecting parabolas, each represented by a distinct line.

Consider the negative feedback system shown in Figure 6–24.We can plot the root loci for this system by applying the general rules and procedure for constructing root loci, or use MATLAB to get root-locus plots. MATLAB Program 6–7 will plot the root-locus diagram for the system.The plot is shown in Figure 6–25.  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet for a MATLAB program, specifically designed to generate a root-locus plot. The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 6-7.\" \n\n*   **Title and Numbering**\n    *   The title reads \"MATLAB Program 6-7.\"\n    *   This suggests that it might be part of a series or collection of programs within an educational context.\n*   **Code Structure**\n    *   The code is structured into sections, each with its own purpose:\n        *   `num = [1 2 4];` defines a variable `num` and assigns it the value `[1 2 4]`, which could represent numerical data or coefficients.\n        *   `den = conv(conv([1 4 0],[1 6]),[1 1.4]);` calculates the convolution of two sequences, potentially related to signal processing or filtering techniques in control systems.\n        *   `v = [-7 3 -5 5]; axis(v); axis('square')` sets up a coordinate system with specific limits and ensures that the plot is displayed as a square.\n        *   `grid` enables the display of grid lines on the plot, enhancing readability and visualization.\n*   **Root-Locus Plot Generation**\n    *   The command `title('Root-Locus Plot of G(s) = K(s^2 + 2s + 1)')` specifies the title of the root-locus plot to be generated, indicating that it represents a system with transfer function \\(G(s)\\).\n    *   `text(1.0,0.55,'K = 12')` inserts text at specific coordinates on the plot, likely providing additional information about the parameters used in the simulation.\n    *   `text(1.0,3.0,'K = 73')` similarly adds more text to the plot, possibly indicating different conditions or scenarios being analyzed.\n    *   `text(1.0,4.15,'K = 154')` again inserts additional text, which might detail specific results or insights from the root-locus analysis.\n*   **Additional Commands**\n    *   `legend('G(s)')` creates a legend for the plot, identifying what each line represents in terms of the system's transfer function \\(G(s)\\).\n    *   `xlabel('s'); ylabel('K')` labels the axes, indicating that one axis (likely horizontal) represents the variable \\(s\\) and the other (vertical) represents the gain \\(K\\).\n\nIn summary, this MATLAB program is designed to generate a root-locus plot for a system described by its transfer function \\(G(s)\\), with various parameters and conditions being explored through different values of \\(K\\) and text annotations. The code effectively utilizes MATLAB's capabilities to create informative visualizations that can aid in understanding the dynamics of control systems.  \n\nIt can be seen from the root-locus plot of Figure 6–25 that this system is stable only for limited ranges of the value of $K_{\\l}$ —that is, $0<K<12$ and $73\\,<\\,K\\,<\\,154.$ The system becomes unstable for $12<K<73$ and $154<K$ .(If $K$ assumes a value corresponding to unstable operation, the system may break down or may become nonlinear due to a saturation nonlinearity that may exist.) Such a system is called conditionally stable.  \n\nThe image presents a root locus plot, which is a graphical representation of the behavior of a control system's poles as a function of a single parameter. The plot displays the location and movement of the poles in the complex plane.\n\n*   **Plot Title:** The title of the plot reads \"Root-Locus Plot of G(s) = K(s^2 + 2s + 4)/[s(s+1)(s+6)]\"\n    *   This indicates that the system being analyzed is a second-order system with a transfer function represented by the equation.\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   The x-axis represents the real axis, ranging from -7 to 3.\n    *   The y-axis represents the imaginary axis, ranging from -5 to 5.\n*   **Pole Locations:** The plot shows several pole locations marked with small circles.\n    *   There are three poles located at s = -1, s = -6, and a complex conjugate pair at s = -2 ± j√3.\n    *   These pole locations indicate the stability and behavior of the system.\n*   **Gain K:** The plot also shows the effect of varying the gain K on the pole locations.\n    *   As K increases, the poles move away from the origin in a counterclockwise direction around the imaginary axis.\n    *   This indicates that increasing the gain K will increase the damping ratio and stability of the system.\n\nIn summary, the root locus plot provides valuable insights into the behavior and stability of the control system. By analyzing the pole locations and their movement as the gain K varies, engineers can determine the range of values for K that result in a stable system.  \n  \nFigure 6–25 Root-locus plot of conditionally stable system.  \n\nIn practice, conditionally stable systems are not desirable. Conditional stability is dangerous but does occur in certain systems—in particular, a system that has an unstable feedforward path. Such an unstable feedforward path may occur if the system has a minor loop. It is advisable to avoid such conditional stability since, if the gain drops beyond the critical value for any reason, the system becomes unstable. Note that the addition of a proper compensating network will eliminate conditional stability.[An addition of a zero will cause the root loci to bend to the left. (See Section 6–5.) Hence conditional stability may be eliminated by adding proper compensation.]  \n\nNonminimum-Phase Systems. If all the poles and zeros of a system lie in the lefthalf $s$ plane, then the system is called minimum phase. If a system has at least one pole or zero in the right-half $s$ plane, then the system is called nonminimum phase. The term nonminimum phase comes from the phase-shift characteristics of such a system when subjected to sinusoidal inputs.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 6–26(a). For this system  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K\\!\\left(1\\,-\\,T_{a}s\\right)}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}\\qquad\\bigl(T_{a}>0\\bigr),\\qquad H(s)=1\n$$  \n\nThis is a nonminimum-phase system, since there is one zero in the right-half $s$ plane. For this system, the angle condition becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\lefteqn{\\frac{\\big/G(s)}{\\big/}=\\Bigg\\langle\\!\\frac{K\\big(T_{a}s\\,-\\,1\\big)}{s\\big(T s\\,+\\,1\\big)}\\qquad}}\\\\ &{=\\Bigg\\lceil\\!\\frac{K\\big(T_{a}s\\,-\\,1\\big)}{s\\big(T s\\,+\\,1\\big)}+\\,180^{\\circ}\\qquad}\\\\ &{=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)\\qquad(k\\,=\\,0,1,2,\\dots)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\left\\langle\\frac{K(T_{a}s\\,-\\,1)}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}=0^{\\circ}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical diagram, comprising two distinct components: (a) and (b). Component (a) is a block diagram illustrating a system with input R(s), output C(s), and transfer function K(1 - Ta*s)/s(Ts + 1). This component utilizes the Laplace transform to represent the relationship between the input and output of the system.\n\nComponent (b) displays a root locus plot, showcasing the evolution of closed-loop poles as the gain parameter K is varied. The roots are plotted on the complex plane, with their magnitude decreasing as K increases. The root locus provides valuable information about the stability and performance of the control system.\n\nIn summary, the image consists of a block diagram and a root locus plot that illustrate the relationship between the input and output of a system using Laplace transforms and provide insight into the stability characteristics of the control system as the gain parameter is varied. 6–26 (a) Nonminimumphase system; (b) root-locus plot.  \n\nThe root loci can be obtained from Equation (6–16). Figure 6–26(b) shows a root-locus plot for this system. From the diagram, we see that the system is stable if the gain $K$ is less than $1/T_{a}$ .  \n\nFigure 6–27 Root-locus plot of $G(s)=\\frac{K(1-0.5s)}{s(s+1)}.$  \n\nThe graph depicts a circle, which is a continuous closed curve that surrounds an area. The circle's center appears to be located at (2.5, 0) on the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\n**Circle Parameters:**\n\n* **Center:** (2.5, 0)\n* **Radius:** Not explicitly stated in the image\n* **Orientation:** Clockwise\n\nThe circle is surrounded by a grid of dots that form a larger square. This suggests that the circle's center lies at the intersection of two lines on a Cartesian coordinate system, which are perpendicular to each other.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe graph likely represents a mathematical concept or function related to geometry and spatial relationships. The circle may be used to illustrate concepts such as symmetry, periodicity, or the behavior of functions near their center points. Without additional context or information about the specific application or purpose of this graph, it is difficult to provide further interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image depicts a circle with its center at (2.5, 0) and an unspecified radius. The surrounding grid of dots suggests that the circle is part of a larger geometric structure or mathematical concept. Further analysis would require additional context or information about the purpose and intended audience for this graph.  \n\nTo obtain a root-locus plot with MATLAB, enter the numerator and denominator as usual. For example, if $T=1$ sec and $T_{a}\\,=\\,0.5$ sec ,enter the following num and den in the program:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{n u m}=[-0.5\\ \\ 1]}\\\\ {\\mathsf{d e n}=[1\\ \\ 1\\ \\ 0]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 6–8 gives the plot of the root loci shown in Figure 6–27.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for generating a root locus plot. The program is written in a text-based format and includes several lines of code that define the variables, functions, and commands used to generate the plot.\n\n*   **MATLAB Program**\n    *   The first line of the program defines the variable \"num\" as a vector containing the coefficients of a polynomial.\n        *   num = [-0.5 1];\n    *   The second line defines the variable \"den\" as a vector containing the coefficients of another polynomial.\n        *   den = [1 2 3];\n    *   The third line uses the \"rlocus\" function to generate the root locus plot.\n        *   rlocus(num, den);\n*   **Root Locus Plot**\n    *   The program generates a root locus plot with a grid of lines and symbols representing the roots of the polynomials.\n        *   The x-axis represents the real part of the roots, while the y-axis represents the imaginary part.\n        *   The plot shows multiple branches of the root locus, each corresponding to a different pole-zero configuration.\n*   **Legend**\n    *   A legend is displayed at the bottom right corner of the plot, showing the key for interpreting the symbols and colors used in the plot.\n\nOverall, the image provides a clear and concise example of how to use MATLAB to generate a root locus plot.  \n\nOrthogonality of Root Loci and Constant-Gain Loci. Consider the negative feedback system whose open-loop transfer function is $G(s)H(s)$ .In the $G(s)H(s)$ plane, the loci of $|G(s)H(s)|\\,=$ constant are circles centered at the origin, and the loci corresponding to $\\ L G(s)H(s)=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\mathrm{~+~}1)$ $(k\\,=\\,0,1,2,.\\,.\\,.)$ lie on the negative real axis of the $G(s)H(s)$ plane, as shown in Figure 6–28. [Note that the complex plane employed here is not the $s$ plane, but the $G(s)H(s)$ plane.]  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive representation of complex numbers and their relationships, featuring various mathematical concepts and symbols. The image is divided into two sections: the top section and the bottom section.\n\n* **Top Section**\n\t+ A circular graph with a radius of 1\n\t+ Labeled as \"G(s) H(s) Plane\"\n\t+ Features an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the direction of increasing values\n\t+ Includes a mathematical equation: |G(s) H(s)| = constant\n* **Bottom Section**\n\t+ A rectangular graph with a horizontal axis labeled \"Re\" and a vertical axis labeled \"Im\"\n\t+ Labeled as \"G(s) H(s) Plane\"\n\t+ Features an arrow pointing upwards, indicating the direction of increasing values\n\t+ Includes a mathematical equation: 1/G(s) H(s) = ±180° (2k + 1)\n\nIn summary, the image provides a visual representation of complex numbers and their relationships, including concepts such as magnitude, phase angle, and conjugate symmetry. The top section illustrates the concept of magnitude on a circular graph, while the bottom section represents the concept of phase angle on a rectangular graph. 6–28 Plots of constantgain and constantphase loci in the $G(s)H(s)$ plane.  \n\nThe root loci and constant-gain loci in the $s$ plane are conformal mappings of the loci of $/G(s)H(s)=\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\mathrm{~+~}1)$ and of $|G(s)H(s)|\\,=$ constant in the $G(s)H(s)$ plane.  \n\nSince the constant-phase and constant-gain loci in the $G(s)H(s)$ plane are orthogonal, the root loci and constant-gain loci in the $s$ plane are orthogonal. Figure 6–29(a) shows the root loci and constant-gain loci for the following system:  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,2)}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,3},\\qquad H(s)\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a pair of circular diagrams, each comprising a circle and its corresponding polar coordinate system. The left diagram features a solid line representing the circle's edge, accompanied by six points labeled A through F. Point B is situated at the center of the circle, while point C lies on the circle's edge. Points D and E are positioned along the radius extending from the origin to point B, and points F and G are located in the upper right quadrant.\n\nThe right diagram also displays a solid line representing the circle's edge, with three points labeled A through C. Point A is situated at the center of the circle, while points B and C lie on the circle's edge. The left diagram includes arrows pointing away from the origin to indicate direction, whereas the right diagram does not.\n\nBoth diagrams feature labels denoting distance from the origin in polar coordinates. In the left diagram, these labels range from 0 to 6 units, while in the right diagram they range from -2 to +1 unit. The absence of any numerical data on the axes leaves room for interpretation and experimentation.  \n\n# Figure 6–29  \n\not loci and const $G(s)\\,=\\,K(s\\,+\\,2)/(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,3)$ ,$H(s)=1$ (b) system with $G(s)\\,=\\,K/[s(s^{'}+1)(s\\,+\\,2)],\\dot{H(s)}\\,=\\,1$  \n\nNotice that since the pole–zero configuration is symmetrical about the real axis, the constant-gain loci are also symmetrical about the real axis.  \n\nFigure 6–29(b) shows the root loci and constant-gain loci for the system:  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)},\\qquad H(s)=1\n$$  \n\nNotice that since the configuration of the poles in the $s$ plane is symmetrical about the real axis and the line parallel to the imaginary axis passing through point ($\\sigma=-1$ ,$\\omega=0$ ), the constant-gain loci are symmetrical about the $\\omega\\,=\\,0$ line (real axis) and the $\\sigma=-1$ line.  \n\nFrom Figures 6–29(a) and (b), notice that every point in the $s$ plane has the corresponding $K$ value. If we use a command rlocfind (presented next), MATLAB will give the $K$ value of the specified point as well as the nearest closed-loop poles corresponding to this $K$ value.  \n\nFinding the Gain Value $K$ at an Arbitrary Point on the Root Loci. In MATLAB analysis of closed-loop systems, it is frequently desired to find the gain value $K$ at an arbitrary point on the root locus. This can be accomplished by using the following rlocfind command:  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{K},\\,\\mathsf{r}]=\\mathsf{r}\\mathsf{l o c f i n d}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\,\\mathsf{d e n})\n$$  \n\nThe rlocfind command, which must follow an rlocus command, overlays movable $x$ -ycoordinates on the screen. Using the mouse, we position the origin of the $x{-}y$ coordinates over the desired point on the root locus and press the mouse button. Then MATLAB displays on the screen the coordinates of that point, the gain value at that point, and the closed-loop poles corresponding to this gain value.  \n\nIf the selected point is not on the root locus, such as point A in Figure 6–29(a), the rlocfind command gives the coordinates of this selected point, the gain value of this point, such as $K=2$ , and the locations of the closed-loop poles, such as points B and C corresponding to this $K$ value.[Note that every point on the $s$ plane has a gain value.See, for example, Figures 6–29 (a) and (b).]  \n\n# 6–4 ROOT-LOCUS PLOTS OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK SYSTEMS  \n\nRoot Loci for Positive-Feedback Systems.\\* In a complex control system, there may be a positive-feedback inner loop as shown in Figure 6–30. Such a loop is usually stabilized by the outer loop.In what follows,we shall be concerned only with the positivefeedback inner loop.The closed-loop transfer function of the inner loop is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,-\\,G(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n1\\,-\\,G(s)H(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\n\\* Reference W-4  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a signal processing system, featuring various components and their interconnections. The system consists of multiple blocks connected by arrows, indicating the flow of signals between them.\n\n*   **Input Block**\n    *   Located at the top-left corner of the diagram\n    *   Represents an input signal to the system\n    *   Labeled as \"C(s)\"\n*   **Filter Block (G1(s))**\n    *   Positioned directly below the input block\n    *   Denotes a filter that processes the input signal\n    *   Labeled as \"G1(s)\"\n*   **Adder Block (R(s))**\n    *   Situated to the right of the filter block\n    *   Represents an adder that combines the output signals from the filter and another block\n    *   Labeled as \"R(s)\"\n*   **Delay Block (H(s))**\n    *   Located below the adder block\n    *   Indicates a delay element in the signal processing chain\n    *   Labeled as \"H(s)\"\n*   **Output Block (G(s))**\n    *   Positioned at the bottom-right corner of the diagram\n    *   Denotes an output signal from the system\n    *   Labeled as \"G(s)\"\n\nThe arrows connecting these blocks illustrate the flow of signals through the system. The input block feeds into the filter block, which then sends its output to the adder block. The adder combines this signal with another input from the delay block before sending the resulting signal to the output block.\n\nIn summary, the image represents a simple signal processing system consisting of an input block, a filter block, an adder block, a delay block, and an output block. These blocks are interconnected by arrows indicating the flow of signals through the system.  \n\nFigure 6–30 Control system.  \n\nThis equation can be solved in a manner similar to the development of the root-locus method for negative-feedback systems presented in Section 6–2. The angle condition, however, must be altered.  \n\nEquation (6–17) can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nwhich is equivalent to the following two equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle\\underline{{{/G(s)}}}{H(s)}=0^{\\circ}\\pm k360^{\\circ}\\qquad(k=0,1,2,\\dots)}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle\\underline{{{|G(s)}}}{H(s)|}=1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor the positive-feedback case, the total sum of all angles from the open-loop poles and zeros must be equal to $0^{\\circ}\\pm\\,k360^{\\circ}$ .Thus the root locus follows a $0^{\\circ}$ locus in contrast to the $180^{\\circ}$ locus considered previously.The magnitude condition remains unaltered.  \n\nTo illustrate the root-locus plot for the positive-feedback system, we shall use the following transfer functions $G(s)$ and $H(s)$ as an example.  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K(s+2)}{(s+3)(s^{2}+2s+2)},\\qquad H(s)=1\n$$  \n\nThe gain $K$ is assumed to be positive.  \n\nThe general rules for constructing root loci for negative-feedback systems given in Section 6–2 must be modified in the following way:  \n\nRule 2 is Modified as Follows: If the total number of real poles and real zeros to the right of a test point on the real axis is even, then this test point lies on the root locus.  \n\nRule 3 is Modified as Follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Angles\\;of\\;asymptotes}={\\frac{\\pm k360^{\\circ}}{n\\,-\\,m}}\\qquad(k\\,=\\,0,1,2,\\dots)\n$$  \n\nwhere $n=$ number of finite poles of $G(s)H(s)$  \n\nRule 5 is Modified as Follows: When calculating the angle of departure (or angle of arrival) from a complex open-loop pole (or at a complex zero), subtract from $0^{\\circ}$ the sum of all angles of the vectors from all the other poles and zeros to the complex pole (or complex zero) in question, with appropriate signs included.  \n\nOther rules for constructing the root-locus plot remain the same.We shall now apply the modified rules to construct the root-locus plot.  \n\n1. Plot the open-loop poles $(s=-1\\,+\\,j,s\\,=-1\\,-\\,j,s\\,=-3)$ and zero ($[s=-2]$ )in the complex plane.As $K$ is increased from 0 to $\\infty$ , the closed-loop poles start at the open-loop poles and terminate at the open-loop zeros (finite or infinite), just as in the case of negative-feedback systems.  \n\n2. Determine the root loci on the real axis. Root loci exist on the real axis between $^{-2}$ and $+\\infty$ and between $^{-3}$ and $-\\infty$ .  \n\n3. Determine the asymptotes of the root loci. For the present system,  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Angles\\;of\\;asymptote}={\\frac{\\pm k360^{\\circ}}{3\\,-\\,1}}=\\pm180^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThis simply means that asymptotes are on the real axis.  \n\n4. Determine the breakaway and break-in points. Since the characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n(s\\,+\\,3)\\bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,2\\bigr)\\,-\\,K(s\\,+\\,2)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\nK=\\frac{(s\\,+\\,3)(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,2)}{s\\,+\\,2}\n$$  \n\nBy differentiating $K$ with respect to $s$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d K}{d s}=\\frac{2s^{3}\\,+\\,11s^{2}\\,+\\,20s\\,+\\,10}{(s\\,+\\,2)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nNote that  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{2s^{3}\\,+\\,11s^{2}\\,+\\,20s\\,+\\,10\\,=\\,2(s\\,+\\,0.8)\\bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,4.7s\\,+\\,6.24\\bigr)}\\\\ {\\,=\\,2(s\\,+\\,0.8)(s\\,+\\,2.35\\,+\\,j0.77)(s\\,+\\,2.35\\,-\\,j0.77)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nPoint $s\\,=\\,-0.8$ is on the root locus. Since this point lies between two zeros (a finite zero and an infinite zero), it is an actual break-in point. Points $s\\,=\\,-2.35\\,\\pm\\,j0.77$ do not satisfy the angle condition and, therefore, they are neither breakaway nor break-in points.  \n\n5. Find the angle of departure of the root locus from a complex pole. For the complex pole at $s=-1+j$ ,the angle of departure $\\theta$ is  \n\n$$\n\\theta\\,=\\,0^{\\circ}\\,-\\,27^{\\circ}\\,-\\,90^{\\circ}\\,+\\,45^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\theta=-72^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\n(The angle of departure from the complex pole at $s=-1\\,-\\,j$ is $72^{\\circ}$ .)  \n\n6. Choose a test point in the broad neighborhood of the $j\\omega$ axis and the origin and apply the angle condition. Locate a sufficient number of points that satisfy the angle condition.  \n\nFigure 6–31 shows the root loci for the given positive-feedback system.The root loci are shown with dashed lines and a curve.  \n\nNote that if  \n\n$$\nK>\\frac{(s\\,+\\,3)(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,2)}{s\\,+\\,2}\\,\\bigg|_{s=0}=3\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, resembling those found in standard coordinate systems. The x-axis is labeled with values ranging from -5 to 2, while the y-axis features labels including \"j,\" \"-j1,\" and \"-j2.\" Notably, the origin of the graph does not have an explicit label.\n\nA key aspect of this image is its focus on symmetry. When examining the left half of the graph, it becomes apparent that a corresponding point exists in the right half. This observation implies that the graph exhibits reflective symmetry with respect to the y-axis. As a result, the entire graph can be considered symmetrical about the y-axis.\n\nIn summary, this image displays a coordinate system with labeled axes and an implicit symmetry about the y-axis. 6–31 Root-locus plot for the positive-feedback system with $G(s)\\,=\\,K(s\\,+\\,2)/$ $\\big[(s\\,+\\,3)\\big(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,2\\big)\\big],$ $H(s)=1$  \n\none real root enters the right-half $s$ plane. Hence, for values of $K$ greater than 3, the system becomes unstable. (For $K>3$ ,the system must be stabilized with an outer loop.) Note that the closed-loop transfer function for the positive-feedback system is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,-\\,G(s)H(s)}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\qquad=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,2)}{(s\\,+\\,3)\\big(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,2\\big)\\,-\\,K(s\\,+\\,2)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTo compare this root-locus plot with that of the corresponding negative-feedback system,we show in Figure 6–32 the root loci for the negative-feedback system whose closedloop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,2)}{(s\\,+\\,3)\\bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,2s\\,+\\,2\\bigr)\\,+\\,K(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nTable 6–2 shows various root-locus plots of negative-feedback and positive-feedback systems.The closed-loop transfer functions are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C}{R}}=\\frac{G}{1\\,+\\,G H},\\quad}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,negative-feedback\\;systems}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C}{R}}=\\frac{G}{1\\,-\\,G H},\\quad}}&{{\\mathrm{for\\,positive-feedback\\;systems}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, x and y, which appear to be coordinate axes. The x-axis is labeled with numbers ranging from -5 to 2, while the y-axis is labeled with numbers ranging from -3 to 1.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the graph represents a set of functions or relationships between the variables on the x and y axes. However, without additional context or information about the specific function being represented, it is challenging to provide further details.\n\nThe graph itself appears to be a simple representation of a mathematical relationship, but its meaning and significance are unclear without more context. It is possible that the graph is intended to illustrate a concept or principle in mathematics or another field, but without additional information, it remains ambiguous.\n\nIn conclusion, while the image presents a clear visual representation of a mathematical relationship, its specific meaning and purpose remain uncertain due to the lack of contextual information.

In building a control system, we know that proper modification of the plant dynamics may be a simple way to meet the performance specifications.This,however,may not be possible in many practical situations because the plant may be fixed and not modifiable.Then we must adjust parameters other than those in the fixed plant. In this book, we assume that the plant is given and unalterable.  \n\nIn practice,the root-locus plot of a system may indicate that the desired performance cannot be achieved just by the adjustment of gain (or some other adjustable parameter). In fact, in some cases, the system may not be stable for all values of gain (or other adjustable parameter). Then it is necessary to reshape the root loci to meet the performance specifications.  \n\nThe design problems, therefore, become those of improving system performance by insertion of a compensator. Compensation of a control system is reduced to the design of a filter whose characteristics tend to compensate for the undesirable and unalterable characteristics of the plant.  \n\nDesign by Root-Locus Method. The design by the root-locus method is based on reshaping the root locus of the system by adding poles and zeros to the system’s open-loop transfer function and forcing the root loci to pass through desired closed-loop poles in the $s$ plane.The characteristic of the root-locus design is its being based on the assumption that the closed-loop system has a pair of dominant closed-loop poles.This means that the effects of zeros and additional poles do not affect the response characteristics very much.  \n\nIn designing a control system, if other than a gain adjustment (or other parameter adjustment) is required,we must modify the original root loci by inserting a suitable compensator.Once the effects on the root locus of the addition of poles and/or zeros are fully understood,we can readily determine the locations of the pole(s) and zero(s) of the compensator that will reshape the root locus as desired. In essence, in the design by the rootlocus method, the root loci of the system are reshaped through the use of a compensator so that a pair of dominant closed-loop poles can be placed at the desired location.  \n\nSeries Compensation and Parallel (or Feedback) Compensation. Figures 6–33(a) and (b) show compensation schemes commonly used for feedback control systems. Figure 6–33(a) shows the configuration where the compensator $G_{c}(s)$ is placed in series with the plant.This scheme is called series compensation.  \n\nAn alternative to series compensation is to feed back the signal(s) from some element(s) and place a compensator in the resulting inner feedback path,as shown in Figure 6–33(b). Such compensation is called parallel compensation or feedback compensation .  \n\nIn compensating control systems, we see that the problem usually boils down to a suitable design of a series or parallel compensator.The choice between series compensation and parallel compensation depends on the nature of the signals in the system, the power levels at various points, available components, the designer’s experience, economic considerations, and so on.  \n\nIn general,series compensation may be simpler than parallel compensation;however, series compensation frequently requires additional amplifiers to increase the gain and/or to provide isolation.(To avoid power dissipation,the series compensator is inserted at the lowest energy point in the feedforward path.) Note that, in general, the number of components required in parallel compensation will be less than the number of components  \n\nFigure 6–33   \n(a) Series   \ncompensation;   \n(b) parallel or feedback compensation.  \n\nThe image presents a diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, likely representing a system or process. The diagram is divided into two sections, labeled \"a\" and \"b\", each containing multiple boxes connected by arrows.\n\n**Section a:**\n\n*   **G(s)**: A box with an input arrow pointing to it from the left.\n*   **H(s)**: A box with an output arrow pointing away from it to the right.\n*   **Gc(s)**: A box with an input arrow pointing to it from the top and an output arrow pointing down.\n*   **G(s) + Gc(s)**: An equation symbol representing the addition of two signals.\n\nThe arrows in this section indicate the flow of signals, with solid lines representing direct connections and dashed lines indicating indirect connections or feedback loops. The diagram does not provide explicit labels for each component, but based on common notation, it appears to represent a signal processing system involving filtering, amplification, and possibly other operations.\n\n**Section b:**\n\n*   **G1(s)**: A box with an input arrow pointing to it from the left.\n*   **G2(s)**: A box with an input arrow pointing to it from the right.\n*   **H(s)**: A box with an output arrow pointing away from it to the top.\n*   **Gc(s)**: A box with an input arrow pointing to it from the bottom and an output arrow pointing up.\n\nThis section of the diagram seems to represent a more complex system, possibly involving multiple stages or branches of signal processing. The presence of both direct and indirect connections suggests that this system may incorporate feedback mechanisms or parallel paths for signal flow.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe diagram provides a visual representation of how signals are manipulated and transformed as they pass through different components within the system. While specific details about each component's function are not provided, the layout offers insights into the relationships between these elements and their roles in processing information.  \n\nin series compensation, provided a suitable signal is available, because the energy transfer is from a higher power level to a lower level. (This means that additional amplifiers may not be necessary.)  \n\nIn Sections 6–6 through 6–9 we first discuss series compensation techniques and then present a parallel compensation technique using a design of a velocity-feedback control system.  \n\nCommonly Used Compensators. If a compensator is needed to meet the performance specifications, the designer must realize a physical device that has the prescribed transfer function of the compensator.  \n\nNumerous physical devices have been used for such purposes.In fact,many noble and useful ideas for physically constructing compensators may be found in the literature.  \n\nIf a sinusoidal input is applied to the input of a network, and the steady-state output (which is also sinusoidal) has a phase lead, then the network is called a lead network. (The amount of phase lead angle is a function of the input frequency.) If the steady-state output has a phase lag, then the network is called a lag network. In a lag–lead network, both phase lag and phase lead occur in the output but in different frequency regions; phase lag occurs in the low-frequency region and phase lead occurs in the high-frequency region.A compensator having a characteristic of a lead network,lag network,or lag–lead network is called a lead compensator, lag compensator, or lag–lead compensator.  \n\nAmong the many kinds of compensators, widely employed compensators are the lead compensators, lag compensators, lag–lead compensators, and velocity-feedback (tachometer) compensators. In this chapter we shall limit our discussions mostly to these types. Lead, lag, and lag–lead compensators may be electronic devices (such as circuits using operational amplifiers) or $R C$ networks (electrical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic, or combinations thereof) and amplifiers.  \n\nFrequently used series compensators in control systems are lead, lag, and lag–lead compensators. PID controllers which are frequently used in industrial control systems are discussed in Chapter 8.  \n\nThe image presents a set of three graphs, each with its own distinct characteristics. The first graph is a horizontal line that spans across the entire x-axis, while the second graph consists of two vertical lines positioned at opposite ends of the y-axis. The third graph features a parabolic curve.\n\nHere are the main points describing the image:\n\n*   **First Graph**\n    *   Horizontal line\n    *   Spans across entire x-axis\n    *   No visible data or labels\n*   **Second Graph**\n    *   Two vertical lines\n    *   Positioned at opposite ends of y-axis\n    *   No visible data or labels\n*   **Third Graph**\n    *   Parabolic curve\n    *   Curve opens upwards\n    *   No visible data or labels\n\nIn summary, the image displays three graphs with unique shapes and characteristics. The first graph is a horizontal line, the second graph consists of two vertical lines, and the third graph features a parabolic curve. There are no visible data or labels on any of the graphs. 6–34 (a) Root-locus plot of a single-pole system; (b) root-locus plot of a two-pole system; (c) root-locus plot of a three-pole system.  \n\nIt is noted that in designing control systems by the root-locus or frequency-response methods the final result is not unique,because the best or optimal solution may not be precisely defined if the time-domain specifications or frequency-domain specifications are given.  \n\nEffects of the Addition of Poles. The addition of a pole to the open-loop transfer function has the effect of pulling the root locus to the right, tending to lower the system’s relative stability and to slow down the settling of the response. (Remember that the addition of integral control adds a pole at the origin, thus making the system less stable.) Figure 6–34 shows examples of root loci illustrating the effects of the addition of a pole to a single-pole system and the addition of two poles to a single-pole system.  \n\nEffects of the Addition of Zeros. The addition of a zero to the open-loop transfer function has the effect of pulling the root locus to the left,tending to make the system more stable and to speed up the settling of the response. (Physically, the addition of a zero in the feedforward transfer function means the addition of derivative control to the system.The effect of such control is to introduce a degree of anticipation into the system and speed up the transient response.) Figure 6–35(a) shows the root loci for a system that is stable for small gain but unstable for large gain. Figures 6–35(b), (c), and (d) show root-locus plots for the system when a zero is added to the open-loop transfer function. Notice that when a zero is added to the system of Figure 6–35(a), it becomes stable for all values of gain.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of four mathematical graphs, each displaying a distinct function or equation. The graphs are arranged in two rows, with the top row featuring two graphs labeled (a) and (b), and the bottom row featuring two graphs labeled (c) and (d). Each graph is accompanied by various symbols and notations.\n\n*   **Graphs:**\n    *   Graph (a): A parabolic shape with its vertex at the origin (0, 0).\n        *   The function appears to be a quadratic equation in the form of y = ax^2 + bx + c.\n        *   The graph is symmetric about the y-axis and has a positive slope.\n    *   Graph (b): An exponential curve with its base at the origin (0, 1).\n        *   The function seems to be an exponential equation in the form of y = ab^x.\n        *   The graph is increasing as x increases and has a horizontal asymptote at y = 1.\n    *   Graph (c): A hyperbolic shape with its center at the origin (0, 0).\n        *   The function appears to be a rational equation in the form of y = a/x + b.\n        *   The graph is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis and has asymptotes at x = 0 and y = 0.\n    *   Graph (d): A sinusoidal curve with its amplitude at the origin (0, 1).\n        *   The function seems to be a trigonometric equation in the form of y = asin(bx) + c or y = acos(bx) + c.\n        *   The graph oscillates between -1 and 1 as x increases and has a periodic nature.\n\nIn summary, the image displays four distinct mathematical graphs, each representing different types of functions. These include quadratic, exponential, rational, and trigonometric equations, showcasing various characteristics such as symmetry, asymptotes, and periodicity. 6–35 (a) Root-locus plot of a three-pole system; (b), (c), and (d) root-locus plots showing effects of addition of a zero to the three-pole system.   \nChapter 6 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Root-Locus Method  \n\n# 6–6 LEAD COMPENSATION  \n\nIn Section 6–5 we presented an introduction to compensation of control systems and discussed preliminary materials for the root-locus approach to control-systems design and compensation. In this section we shall present control-systems design by use of the lead compensation technique. In carrying out a control-system design, we place a compensator in series with the unalterable transfer function $G(s)$ to obtain desirable behavior. The main problem then involves the judicious choice of the pole(s) and zero(s) of the compensator $G_{c}(s)$ to have the dominant closed-loop poles at the desired location in the $s$ plane so that the performance specifications will be met.  \n\nThe image depicts a circuit diagram, specifically an operational amplifier (op-amp) circuit. The circuit is designed to perform various operations such as amplification, filtering, and integration.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components and their functions:\n\n*   **Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp):** Represented by the symbol \"E(s)\", the op-amp is the central component of the circuit. It acts as an amplifier, allowing small input signals to be amplified to larger output levels.\n*   **Resistors:** The resistors are labeled R1, R2, R3, and R4. They play a crucial role in setting the gain and determining the frequency response of the circuit.\n*   **Capacitors:** C1 and C2 represent capacitors that filter out unwanted frequencies from the input signal. Capacitors block DC signals while allowing AC signals to pass through.\n*   **Input and Output Signals:** The input signal is represented by Ei(s), while the output signal is denoted as Eo(s). These signals are connected to the op-amp via resistors.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Inverting Amplifier Configuration:** The circuit is configured in an inverting amplifier configuration, where the output voltage is inverted with respect to the input voltage.\n*   **Gain Control:** The gain of the amplifier can be controlled by adjusting the values of R2 and R4. A larger value for R4 will result in a higher gain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, this circuit diagram represents an operational amplifier circuit designed for amplifying and filtering signals. The op-amp is the core component, while resistors and capacitors work together to control the gain and frequency response of the circuit. Understanding these components and their functions is essential for designing and analyzing electronic circuits. 6–36 Electronic circuit that is a lead network if $R_{1}C_{1}>R_{2}C_{2}$ and a lag network if $R_{1}C_{1}<R_{2}C_{2}$ .  \n\nLead Compensators and Lag Compensators. There are many ways to realize lead compensators and lag compensators, such as electronic networks using operational amplifiers, electrical $R C$ networks, and mechanical spring-dashpot systems.  \n\nFigure 6–36 shows an electronic circuit using operational amplifiers. The transfer function for this circuit was obtained in Chapter 3 as follows [see Equation (3–36)]:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\frac{R_{2}R_{4}}{R_{1}R_{3}}\\frac{R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+\\,1}{R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+\\,1}=\\frac{R_{4}C_{1}}{R_{3}C_{2}}\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{R_{2}C_{2}}}\n$$  \n\n$$\n=K_{c}\\alpha\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}=K_{c}{\\frac{s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T}}}{s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nT\\,=\\,R_{1}C_{1},\\qquad\\alpha T\\,=\\,R_{2}C_{2},\\qquad K_{c}=\\frac{R_{4}C_{1}}{R_{3}C_{2}}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a diagram with two distinct sections, labeled (a) and (b), each featuring a set of mathematical equations and symbols. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate and compare these equations.\n\n* A diagram of two sets of equations:\n\t+ Each section has a title: \"(a)\" and \"(b)\"\n\t+ Both sections have a horizontal line with an arrow at the end\n\t+ Section (a) contains three lines of text, while section (b) contains four lines\n\t+ The equations in both sections are similar but not identical\n\nThe main finding from this image is that it compares two sets of mathematical equations, highlighting their similarities and differences. There are no significant changes or comparisons to note within the image itself, as it only presents these equations without any additional context or analysis. 6–37Pole-zero configurations: (a) lead network; (b) lag network.  \n\nNotice that  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\alpha=\\frac{R_{4}C_{1}}{R_{3}C_{2}}\\frac{R_{2}C_{2}}{R_{1}C_{1}}=\\frac{R_{2}R_{4}}{R_{1}R_{3}},\\qquad\\alpha=\\frac{R_{2}C_{2}}{R_{1}C_{1}}\n$$  \n\nThis network has a dc gain of $K_{c}\\alpha\\,=\\,R_{2}R_{4}/\\bigl(R_{1}R_{3}\\bigr)$ .  \n\nFrom Equation (6–18), we see that this network is a lead network if $R_{1}C_{1}>R_{2}C_{2}$ ,or $\\alpha<1.$ .It is a lag network if $R_{1}C_{1}<R_{2}C_{2}$ .The pole-zero configurations of this network when $R_{1}C_{1}>R_{2}C_{2}$ and $R_{1}C_{1}<R_{2}C_{2}$ are shown in Figure 6–37(a) and (b), respectively.  \n\nLead Compensation Techniques Based on the Root-Locus Approach. The root-locus approach to design is very powerful when the specifications are given in terms of time-domain quantities, such as the damping ratio and undamped natural frequency of the desired dominant closed-loop poles, maximum overshoot, rise time, and settling time.  \n\nConsider a design problem in which the original system either is unstable for all values of gain or is stable but has undesirable transient-response characteristics. In such a case, the reshaping of the root locus is necessary in the broad neighborhood of the $j\\omega$ axis and the origin in order that the dominant closed-loop poles be at desired locations in the complex plane.This problem may be solved by inserting an appropriate lead compensator in cascade with the feedforward transfer function.  \n\nThe procedures for designing a lead compensator for the system shown in Figure 6–38 by the root-locus method may be stated as follows:  \n\n1. From the performance specifications, determine the desired location for the dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, featuring two rectangular blocks connected by arrows. The left block is labeled \"Gc(s)\" and has an input arrow pointing to it from the left side of the image. This suggests that Gc(s) represents the transfer function or controller in the system.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the image, there is another rectangular block labeled \"Gs(s)\". An output arrow points outwards from this block, indicating that it represents the plant or process being controlled by the controller.\n\nA thick black line connects the two blocks, forming a closed loop. This signifies that the control system operates in a feedback configuration, where the output of Gs(s) is fed back to Gc(s), allowing for continuous monitoring and adjustment of the system's performance.\n\nThe image does not provide any additional context or information about the specific values or units associated with Gc(s) and Gs(s). However, it clearly illustrates the fundamental components of a control system: the controller (Gc(s)) and the plant (Gs(s)), along with their interconnection through feedback. 6–38 Control system.   \nChapter 6 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Root-Locus Method  \n\n2. By drawing the root-locus plot of the uncompensated system (original system), ascertain whether or not the gain adjustment alone can yield the desired closedloop poles. If not, calculate the angle deficiency $\\phi$ .This angle must be contributed by the lead compensator if the new root locus is to pass through the desired locations for the dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\n3. Assume the lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ to be  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\alpha\\frac{T s+1}{\\alpha T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}},~~~~~(0<\\alpha<1)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $T$ are determined from the angle deficiency. $K_{c}$ is determined from the requirement of the open-loop gain.  \n\n4. If static error constants are not specified, determine the location of the pole and zero of the lead compensator so that the lead compensator will contribute the necessary angle $\\phi$ . If no other requirements are imposed on the system, try to make the value of $\\alpha$ as large as possible.A larger value of $\\alpha$ generally results in a larger value of $K_{v}$ ,which is desirable. Note that  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)=K_{c}\\alpha\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)\n$$  \n\n5. Determine the value of $K_{c}$ of the lead compensator from the magnitude condition.  \n\nOnce a compensator has been designed, check to see whether all performance specifications have been met. If the compensated system does not meet the performance specifications, then repeat the design procedure by adjusting the compensator pole and zero until all such specifications are met. If a large static error constant is required, cascade a lag network or alter the lead compensator to a lag–lead compensator.  \n\nNote that if the selected dominant closed-loop poles are not really dominant, or if the selected dominant closed-loop poles do not yield the desired result, it will be necessary to modify the location of the pair of such selected dominant closed-loop poles. (The closed-loop poles other than dominant ones modify the response obtained from the dominant closed-loop poles alone.The amount of modification depends on the location of these remaining closed-loop poles.) Also, the closed-loop zeros affect the response if they are located near the origin.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 6–6  \n\nConsider the position control system shown in Figure 6–39(a). The feedforward transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{10}{s(s+1)}}\n$$  \n\nThe root-locus plot for this system is shown in Figure 6–39(b).The closed-loop transfer function for the system is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{10}{s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,10}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\qquad=\\frac{10}{(s\\,+\\,0.5\\,+\\,j3.1225)(s\\,+\\,0.5\\,-\\,j3.1225)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, x and y, which intersect at the origin. The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" (short for real) and ranges from -3 to 1, while the y-axis is labeled \"Im\" (short for imaginary) and also spans from -3 to 1.\n\nHere are the key features of the graph:\n\n*   **Closed-Loop Pole**: A small circle is located at the point (-1, j3), indicating a closed-loop pole.\n*   **Axes Labels**: The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" (real), and the y-axis is labeled \"Im\" (imaginary).\n*   **Axis Range**: Both axes range from -3 to 1.\n\nIn summary, the graph displays a closed-loop pole at (-1, j3) on the complex plane, with real and imaginary axes labeled.  \n\nFigure 6–39 (a) Control system; (b) root-locus plot.  \n\nThe closed-loop poles are located at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-0.5\\,\\pm\\,j3.1225\n$$  \n\nThe damping ratio of the closed-loop poles is $\\zeta=(1/2)/\\sqrt{10}=0.1581.$ .The undamped natural frequency of the closed-loop poles is $\\dot{\\omega_{n}}\\dot{=}\\sqrt{10}=3.1623\\,\\mathrm{r}a$ 'sec.Because the damping ratio is small, this system will have a large overshoot in the step response and is not desirable.  \n\nIt is desired to design a lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ as shown in Figure 6–40(a) so that the dominant closed-loop poles have the damping ratio $\\zeta=0.5$ and the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}=3$ rad 'sec.

This is, however, not the case for the present system.Therefore, we shall insert a lead compensator in the feedforward path.  \n\nA general procedure for determining the lead compensator is as follows: First, find the sum of the angles at the desired location of one of the dominant closed-loop poles with the open-loop poles and zeros of the original system, and determine the necessary angle $\\phi$ to be added so that the total sum of the angles is equal to $\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\,+\\,1)$ The lead compensator must contribute this angle $\\phi$ . (If the angle $\\phi$ is quite large, then two or more lead networks may be needed rather than a single one.)  \n\nAssume that the lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ has the transfer function as follows:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\alpha\\frac{T s+1}{\\alpha T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}},~~~~~(0<\\alpha<1)\n$$  \n\nThe angle from the pole at the origin to the desired dominant closed-loop pole at $s\\,{=}\\,{-}1.5~+~{}\\,{j}2.5981$ is $120^{\\circ}$ .The angle from the pole at $s=-1$ to the desired closed-loop pole is $100.894^{\\circ}$ . Hence, the angle deficiency is  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Angle~deficiency}}\\,=\\,180^{\\circ}-120^{\\circ}-100.894^{\\circ}\\,=\\,-40.894^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nDeficit angle $40.894^{\\circ}$ must be contributed by a lead compensator.  \n\nNote that the solution to such a problem is not unique. There are infinitely many solutions. We shall present two solutions to the problem in what follows.  \n\nMethod 1. There are many ways to determine the locations of the zero and pole of the lead compensator. In what follows we shall introduce a procedure to obtain a largest possible value for $\\alpha$ . (Note that a larger value of $\\alpha$ will produce a larger value of $K_{v}$ .In most cases, the larger the $K_{v}$ is, the better the system performance.) First,draw a horizontal line passing through point $P$ ,the desired location for one of the dominant closed-loop poles.This is shown as line $P A$ in Figure 6–41. Draw also a line connecting point $P$ and the origin. Bisect the angle between the lines $P A$ and $P O$ , as shown in Figure 6–41.Draw two lines $P C$ and $P D$ that make angles $\\pm\\phi/2$ with the bisector $P B$ .The intersections of $P C$ and $P D$ with the negative real axis give the necessary locations for the pole and zero of the lead network.The compensator thus designed will make point $P$ a point on the root locus of the compensated system.The open-loop gain is determined by use of the magnitude condition.  \n\nIn the present system, the angle of $G(s)$ at the desired closed-loop pole is  \n\n$$\n\\left/{\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}}\\right|_{s=-1.5+j2.5981}=-220.894^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a geometric diagram with various symbols and labels. The main elements of the image are:\n\n*   A triangle with vertices labeled A, B, and C.\n    *   The triangle is formed by connecting points A, B, and C with line segments AB, BC, and CA.\n    *   The angle at vertex A is labeled as 1/T radians.\n    *   The length of side AC is labeled as \"jw\" (presumably an abbreviation for \"imaginary unit\").\n*   A circle centered on point O.\n    *   The circle has a radius that corresponds to the length of side BC.\n    *   The circumference of the circle passes through points B and C, indicating that it represents the distance between these two vertices.\n*   Various labels and annotations throughout the image.\n    *   Labels include \"jw\", \"1/T\", and Greek letters such as alpha (α) and beta (β).\n    *   Arrows indicate directions of vectors or forces acting on the system.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be a representation of a complex mathematical problem involving triangles, circles, and trigonometric functions. 6–41Determination of the pole and zero of a lead network.  \n\nThus, if we need to force the root locus to go through the desired closed-loop pole, the lead compensator must contribute $\\phi\\,=\\,40.894^{\\circ}$ at this point. By following the foregoing design procedure, we can determine the zero and pole of the lead compensator.  \n\nReferring to Figure 6–42, if we bisect angle APO and take $40.894^{\\circ}/2$ each side, then the locations of the zero and pole are found as follows:  \n\n$$\n_{\\mathrm{zero\\;at}\\;s}=-1.9432\n$$  \n\nThus, $G_{c}(s)$ can be given as  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\ {\\frac{s+{\\frac{1}{T}}}{s+{\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}}=K_{c}\\ {\\frac{s+1.9432}{s+4.6458}}\n$$  \n\n(For this compensator the value of $\\alpha$ is $\\alpha=1.9432/4.6458=0.418.)$  \n\nThe value of $K_{c}$ can be determined by use of the magnitude condition.  \n\n$$\n\\left|K_{c}\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,1.9432}{s\\,+\\,4.6458}\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}\\right|_{s=-1.5+j2.5981}=1\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\left.\\left|\\frac{(s\\,+\\,4.6458)s(s\\,+\\,1)}{10(s\\,+\\,1.9432)}\\right|_{s=-1.5+j2.5981}=1.2287\n$$  \n\nHence, the lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ just designed is given by  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,1.2287\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,1.9432}{s\\,+\\,4.6458}\n$$  \n\nThen, the open-loop transfer function of the designed system becomes  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)=1.2287\\left({\\frac{s+1.9432}{s+4.6458}}\\right){\\frac{10}{s(s\\mathrm{~+~}1)}}\n$$  \n\nand the closed-loop transfer function becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{12.287(s+1.9432)}{s(s+1)(s+4.6458)+12.287(s+1.9432)}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\frac{12.287s+23.876}{s^{3}+5.646s^{2}+16.933s+23.876}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a geometric representation of complex numbers, specifically the addition and multiplication operations. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top half illustrates the addition operation, while the bottom half demonstrates the multiplication operation.\n\n**Top Half: Addition Operation**\n\n*   A horizontal line represents the real axis (x-axis), with tick marks at regular intervals.\n*   A vertical line perpendicular to the x-axis represents the imaginary axis (y-axis).\n*   Two points are marked on the x-axis:\n    *   Point P, located at a distance of 2 units from the origin (0, 0) towards the positive direction of the x-axis. This point is labeled as \"P\" and has coordinates (2, 0).\n    *   Point A, positioned at a distance of 3 units from the origin towards the negative direction of the x-axis. This point is denoted as \"A\" and has coordinates (-3, 0).\n*   An arrowhead indicates the direction of increasing values along each axis.\n\n**Bottom Half: Multiplication Operation**\n\n*   A horizontal line represents the real axis (x-axis), with tick marks at regular intervals.\n*   A vertical line perpendicular to the x-axis represents the imaginary axis (y-axis).\n*   Three points are marked on the x-axis:\n    *   Point P, located at a distance of 2 units from the origin towards the positive direction of the x-axis. This point is labeled as \"P\" and has coordinates (2, 0).\n    *   Point A, positioned at a distance of 3 units from the origin towards the negative direction of the x-axis. This point is denoted as \"A\" and has coordinates (-3, 0).\n    *   Point j1, situated at a distance of 1 unit from the origin towards the positive direction of the imaginary axis. This point is labeled as \"j1\" and has coordinates (0, 1).\n*   An arrowhead indicates the direction of increasing values along each axis.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   The addition operation involves combining two complex numbers, represented by points A and P on the x-axis.\n*   The multiplication operation involves multiplying a complex number (point P) by another complex number (point j1), resulting in a new point.\n*   The diagram effectively illustrates the geometric representation of complex numbers and their operations.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a clear visual representation of complex numbers and their addition and multiplication operations. By examining the positions of points A, P, and j1, we can understand how these operations are performed geometrically. 6–42 Determination of the pole and zero of the lead compensator.  \n\nThe image depicts a complex number plane, featuring a grid with both real and imaginary axes. The x-axis represents the real component of the complex numbers, while the y-axis represents the imaginary part.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Grid Pattern:** The plane has a grid pattern with evenly spaced lines, allowing for easy navigation and visualization of complex numbers.\n*   **Origin (0):** Located at the center of the plane, marked as \"0\" on both axes. This is the point where the real and imaginary components intersect.\n*   **Real Axis (x-axis):** The horizontal axis, extending from negative infinity to positive infinity along the x-axis, representing the real part of complex numbers.\n*   **Imaginary Axis (y-axis):** The vertical axis, also extending from negative infinity to positive infinity along the y-axis, representing the imaginary part of complex numbers.\n*   **Axis Labels:** The axes are labeled with mathematical notation, indicating that they represent real and imaginary components. 6–43Root-locus plot of the designed system.  \n\nFigure 6–43 shows the root-locus plot for the designed system. It is worthwhile to check the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ for the system just designed.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\lefteqn{K_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)}}\\\\ &{=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}\\;s\\Bigg[1.2287\\,\\frac{s+1.9432}{s+4.6458}\\frac{10}{s(s\\;+\\;1)}\\Bigg]}\\\\ &{=5.139}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that the third closed-loop pole of the designed system is found by dividing the characteristic equation by the known factors as follows:  \n\n$$\ns^{3}+5.646s^{2}+16.933s+23.875=(s+1.5+j2.5981)(s+1.5-j2.5981)(s+2.659)\n$$  \n\nThe foregoing compensation method enables us to place the dominant closed-loop poles at the desired points in the complex plane. The third pole at $s=-2.65$ is fairly close to the added zero at $-1.9432$ . Therefore, the effect of this pole on the transient response is relatively small. Since no restriction has been imposed on the nondominant pole and no specification has been given concerning the value of the static velocity error coefficient, we conclude that the present design is satisfactory.  \n\nMethod 2. If we choose the zero of the lead compensator at $s=-1$ so that it will cancel the plant pole at $s=-1$ , then the compensator pole must be located at $s=-3$ . (See Figure 6–44.) Hence the lead compensator becomes  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\frac{s\\,+\\,1}{s\\,+\\,3}\n$$  \n\nThe value of $K_{c}$ can be determined by use of the magnitude condition.  \n\n$$\n\\left|K_{c}\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,1}{s\\,+\\,3}\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}\\right|_{s=-1.5+j2.5981}=\\,1\n$$  \n\nFigure 6–44   \nCompensator pole and zero.  \n\nor  \n\nThe image presents a graph illustrating the relationship between two variables, with a focus on their behavior at specific points. The graph is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different range of values for the variables.\n\n*   **Desired Closed-Loop Pole**\n    *   Located in the top-right quadrant\n    *   Represented by an arrow pointing upwards and to the right\n    *   Indicates that as one variable increases, the other also increases\n*   **Compensator Pole**\n    *   Situated in the bottom-left quadrant\n    *   Indicated by an arrow pointing downwards and to the left\n    *   Suggests a negative relationship between the variables\n*   **Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) Pole**\n    *   Placed in the top-right quadrant, adjacent to the Desired Closed-Loop Pole\n    *   Represented by an arrow pointing upwards and to the right\n    *   Implies that the ZOH pole has a similar effect on the variables as the desired closed-loop pole\n*   **Compensator Zero**\n    *   Positioned in the top-left quadrant, near the Compensator Pole\n    *   Indicated by an arrow pointing downwards and to the left\n    *   Indicates a negative relationship between the variables\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates the relationships between four poles/zeros and how they affect the behavior of two variables. The desired closed-loop pole and ZOH pole both have a positive effect on one variable as it increases, while the compensator pole has a negative effect on the other variable as it decreases. The compensator zero also has a negative effect on one variable as it increases. Overall, the graph provides insight into how these poles/zeros interact to shape the behavior of the variables.  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\left|\\left.\\frac{s(s\\,+\\,3)}{10}\\right|_{s=-1.5+j2.5981}=0.9\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,0.9\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,1}{s\\,+\\,3}\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the designed system then becomes  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,0.9\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,1}{s\\,+\\,3}\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}=\\frac{9}{s(s\\,+\\,3)}\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function of the compensated system becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{9}{s^{2}+3s\\,+\\,9}}\n$$  \n\nNote that in the present case the zero of the lead compensator will cancel a pole of the plant, resulting in the second-order system,rather than the third-order system as we designed using Method 1. The static velocity error constant for the present case is obtained as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{K_{v}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)}\\\\ {\\qquad=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\ s\\Bigg[\\frac{9}{s(s+3)}\\Bigg]=3}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNotice that the system designed by Method 1 gives a larger value of the static velocity error constant.This means that the system designed by Method 1 will give smaller steady-state errors in following ramp inputs than the system designed by Method 2.  \n\nFor different combinations of a zero and pole of the compensator that contributes $40.894^{\\circ}$ , the value of $K_{v}$ will be different.Although a certain change in the value of $K_{v}$ can be made by altering the pole-zero location of the lead compensator, if a large increase in the value of $K_{v}$ is desired, then we must alter the lead compensator to a lag–lead compensator.  \n\nComparison of step and ramp responses of the compensated and uncompensated systems. In what follows we shall compare the unit-step and unit-ramp responses of the three systems: the original uncompensated system, the system designed by Method 1, and the system designed by Method 2.

While all systems exhibit an initial lag, the compensated systems demonstrate faster responses compared to the uncompensated system. The Compensated System (Method 1) shows the quickest response among the three, while Method 2 has a slightly slower response than Method 1 but still outperforms the uncompensated system. 6–45 Unit-step response curves of designed systems and original uncompensated system.  \n\ndesigned systems is given in MATLAB Program 6–10, where we used the step command to obtain unit-ramp responses by using the numerators and denominators for the systems designed by Method 1 and Method 2 as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathsf{n u m}1=[1\\,2.287\\;\\;23.876]}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{d e n}1=[1\\;\\;5.646\\;\\;16.933\\;\\;23.876\\;\\;0]}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{n u m}2=[9]}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{d e n}2=[1\\;\\;3\\;9\\;\\;0]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph titled \"Unit-Ramp Responses of Compensated Systems,\" which displays the output responses of two compensated systems to a unit ramp input.

By examining the output responses and comparing them to the input signal, one can determine which system produces a more accurate response. The graph's visual representation facilitates easy analysis and comparison of the performance of each system. 6–46 Unit-ramp response curves of designed systems.  \n\nThe resulting unit-ramp response curves are shown in Figure 6–46.  \n\nThe image displays a MATLAB code snippet that generates a graphical representation of unit-ramp responses for compensated systems. The title \"MATLAB Program 6-10\" is displayed at the top, indicating this is likely a programming exercise or example from a textbook.\n\nHere are the key points about the image:\n\n* **Title**: \n\t+ Text: \"MATLAB Program 6-10\"\n\t+ Font: Black\n\t+ Size: 14pt\n* **Code**:\n\t+ Color: Grey\n\t+ Language: MATLAB\n\t+ Syntax Highlighting: Yes\n\t+ Content:\n\t\t- A comment line with the text \"% ***** Unit-Ramp Responses of Compensated Systems *****\"\n\t\t- Several lines of code defining variables and plotting functions\n\t\t- A plot title and labels for the x-axis and y-axis\n\nOverall, the image shows a MATLAB code snippet that generates a graphical representation of unit-ramp responses for compensated systems. The code defines variables, plots functions, and adds labels to the plot.  \n\nIn examining these response curves notice that the compensated system designed by Method 1 exhibits a little bit larger overshoot in the step response than the compensated system designed by Method 2. However, the former has better response characteristics for the ramp input than the latter. So it is difficult to say which one is better.The decision on which one to choose should be made by the response requirements (such as smaller overshoots for step type inputs or smaller steady-state errors in following ramp or changing inputs) expected in the designed system. If both smaller overshoots in step inputs and smaller steady-state errors in following changing inputs are required, then we might use a lag–lead compensator. (See Section 6–8 for the lag–lead compensation techniques.)  \n\n# 6–7 LAG COMPENSATION  \n\nElectronic Lag Compensator Using Operational Amplifiers. The configuration of the electronic lag compensator using operational amplifiers is the same as that for the lead compensator shown in Figure 6–36. If we choose $R_{2}C_{2}>R_{1}C_{1}$ in the circuit shown in Figure 6–36, it becomes a lag compensator. Referring to Figure 6–36, the transfer function of the lag compensator is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\hat{K}_{c}\\beta\\frac{T s+1}{\\beta T s+1}=\\hat{K}_{c}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nT\\,=\\,R_{1}C_{1},\\qquad\\beta T\\,=\\,R_{2}C_{2},\\qquad\\beta\\,=\\frac{R_{2}C_{2}}{R_{1}C_{1}}>1,\\qquad\\hat{K}_{c}=\\frac{R_{4}C_{1}}{R_{3}C_{2}}\n$$  \n\nNote that we use $\\beta$ instead of $\\alpha$ in the above expressions. [In the lead compensator we A Bused $\\alpha$ to indicate the ratio $R_{2}C_{2}/\\big(R_{1}C_{1}\\big)$ ,which was less than 1, or $0<\\alpha<1.]$ In this book we always assume that $0<\\alpha<1$ and $\\beta>1$ .  \n\nLag Compensation Techniques Based on the Root-Locus Approach. Consider the problem of finding a suitable compensation network for the case where the system exhibits satisfactory transient-response characteristics but unsatisfactory steady-state characteristics. Compensation in this case essentially consists of increasing the openloop gain without appreciably changing the transient-response characteristics.This means that the root locus in the neighborhood of the dominant closed-loop poles should not be changed appreciably, but the open-loop gain should be increased as much as needed. This can be accomplished if a lag compensator is put in cascade with the given feedforward transfer function.  \n\nTo avoid an appreciable change in the root loci, the angle contribution of the lag network should be limited to a small amount, say less than $5^{\\circ}$ . To assure this, we place the pole and zero of the lag network relatively close together and near the origin of the $s$ plane.Then the closed-loop poles of the compensated system will be shifted only slightly from their original locations. Hence, the transient-response characteristics will be changed only slightly.  \n\nConsider a lag compensator $G_{c}(s)$ ,where  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,\\hat{K}_{c}\\beta\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\beta T s\\,+\\,1}=\\hat{K}_{c}\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\n$$  \n\nIf we place the zero and pole of the lag compensator very close to each other, then at $s\\implies s_{1}$ ,where $s_{1}$ is one of the dominant closed-loop poles,the magnitudes $s_{1}+\\,(1/T)$ and $s_{1}+\\left[1/(\\beta T)\\right]$ are almost equal, or  \n\n$$\n|G_{c}(s_{1})|\\,=\\,\\left|\\hat{K}_{c}\\,\\frac{s_{1}+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T}}{s_{1}+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\\right|\\div\\hat{K}_{c}\n$$  \n\nTo make the angle contribution of the lag portion of the compensator small, we require  \n\n$$\n-5^{\\circ}<\\left\\langle\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T}}{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}<0^{\\circ}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThis implies that if gain $\\hat{K}_{c}$ of the lag compensator is set equal to 1, the alteration in the transient-response characteristics will be very small,despite the fact that the overall gain of the open-loop transfer function is increased by a factor of $\\beta$ , where $\\beta>1$ .If the pole and zero are placed very close to the origin, then the value of $\\beta$ can be made large. (A large value of $\\beta$ may be used,provided physical realization of the lag compensator is possible.) It is noted that the value of $T$ must be large, but its exact value is not critical. However, it should not be too large in order to avoid difficulties in realizing the phase-lag compensator by physical components.  \n\nAn increase in the gain means an increase in the static error constants. If the openloop transfer function of the uncompensated system is $G(s)$ ,then the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ of the uncompensated system is  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s G(s)\n$$  \n\nIf the compensator is chosen as given by Equation (6–19), then for the compensated system with the open-loop transfer function $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ the static velocity error constant $\\hat{K}_{v}$ becomes  \n\n$$\n\\hat{K}_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}G_{c}(s)K_{v}\\,=\\,\\hat{K}_{c}\\beta K_{v}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K_{v}$ is the static velocity error constant of the uncompensated system.  \n\nThus if the compensator is given by Equation (6–19), then the static velocity error constant is increased by a factor of $\\hat{K}_{c}\\,\\bar{\\beta}$ ,where $\\hat{K}_{c}$ is approximately unity.  \n\nThe main negative effect of the lag compensation is that the compensator zero that will be generated near the origin creates a closed-loop pole near the origin.This closedloop pole and compensator zero will generate a long tail of small amplitude in the step response, thus increasing the settling time.  \n\nDesign Procedures for Lag Compensation by the Root-Locus Method. The procedure for designing lag compensators for the system shown in Figure 6–47 by the root-locus method may be stated as follows (we assume that the uncompensated system meets the transient-response specifications by simple gain adjustment; if this is not the case, refer to Section 6–8):  \n\n1. Draw the root-locus plot for the uncompensated system whose open-loop transfer function is $G(s)$ .Based on the transient-response specifications, locate the dominant closed-loop poles on the root locus. 2. Assume the transfer function of the lag compensator to be given by Equation (6–19):  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,\\hat{K}_{c}\\beta\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\beta T s\\,+\\,1}=\\hat{K}_{c}\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\n$$  \n\nThen the open-loop transfer function of the compensated system becomes $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ .  \n\n3. Evaluate the particular static error constant specified in the problem.   \n4. Determine the amount of increase in the static error constant necessary to satisfy the specifications.   \n5. Determine the pole and zero of the lag compensator that produce the necessary increase in the particular static error constant without appreciably altering the original root loci. (Note that the ratio of the value of gain required in the specifications and the gain found in the uncompensated system is the required ratio between the distance of the zero from the origin and that of the pole from the origin.)   \n6. Draw a new root-locus plot for the compensated system. Locate the desired dominant closed-loop poles on the root locus. (If the angle contribution of the lag network is very small—that is, a few degrees—then the original and new root loci are almost identical. Otherwise, there will be a slight discrepancy between them.Then locate, on the new root locus, the desired dominant closed-loop poles based on   \n7. Adjust gain the transient-response specifications.) $\\hat{K}_{c}$ of the compensator from the magnitude condition so that the domA Binant closed-loop poles lie at the desired location. $\\hat{K}_{c}$ will be approximately 1.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a signal flow graph, which is a graphical representation of a system's dynamics. The diagram consists of several blocks and arrows that illustrate the flow of signals through the system.\n\n**Blocks:**\n\n*   **G(s)**: This block represents a transfer function or a linear time-invariant (LTI) system.\n*   **Gc(s)**: This block represents another transfer function or an LTI system.\n\n**Arrows:**\n\n*   The arrow pointing from the left to **G(s)** indicates that the input signal flows into this block.\n*   The arrow pointing from **G(s)** to **Gc(s)** indicates that the output of one block becomes the input to the other block.\n*   The arrow pointing from **Gc(s)** to the right indicates that the final output is produced by this block.\n\n**Overall Structure:**\n\nThe diagram shows a cascaded structure, where the output of one block is fed into another block. This suggests that the system consists of two stages or subsystems connected in series. The input signal enters the first stage (represented by **G(s)**), and its output is processed further by the second stage (represented by **Gc(s)**) before producing the final output.\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThe diagram implies that the overall system behavior can be analyzed by examining the properties of each individual block. The transfer functions represented by **G(s)** and **Gc(s)** determine how the input signal is transformed at each stage. Understanding these transformations allows us to analyze the system's frequency response, stability, and other important characteristics.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a simple yet informative representation of a signal flow graph, highlighting the sequential processing of signals within an LTI system. By analyzing the individual blocks and their interactions, we can gain insights into the system's dynamics and behavior. 6–47 Control system.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 6–48(a).The feedforward transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{1.06}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nThe root-locus plot for the system is shown in Figure 6–48(b).

The diagram provides a visual representation of how these elements interact within the system, allowing for analysis and understanding of its behavior. 6–49 Compensated system.  \n\nThe angle contribution of this lag network near a dominant closed-loop pole is about $4^{\\circ}$ . Because this angle contribution is not very small, there is a small change in the new root locus near the desired dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the compensated system then becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\hat{K}_{c}\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.05}{s\\,+\\,0.005}\\frac{1.06}{s\\,(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}\\\\ {=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,0.05)}{s\\left(s\\,+\\,0.005\\right)\\left(s\\,+\\,1\\right)\\left(s\\,+\\,2\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nK=1.06\\hat{K}_{c}\n$$  \n\nThe block diagram of the compensated system is shown in Figure 6–49.The root-locus plot for the compensated system near the dominant closed-loop poles is shown in Figure 6–50(a),together with the original root-locus plot. Figure 6–50(b) shows the root-locus plot of the compensated system  \n\nThe image presents a graph with multiple lines, axes, and labels. The purpose of the image is to illustrate the relationship between real and imaginary components in a complex system.\n\n* A graph with multiple lines:\n\t+ There are two main curves: one solid and one dotted.\n\t+ Both curves intersect at several points.\n\t+ The solid curve has a more pronounced slope than the dotted curve.\n* Labels on the axes:\n\t+ The x-axis is labeled \"Real Axis\" and ranges from -2 to 1.\n\t+ The y-axis is labeled \"Imag Axis\" and also ranges from -2 to 1.\n\t+ There are additional labels at specific points on the graph, including \"Compensated system\", \"Original closed-loop pole\", and \"New closed-loop pole\".\n* A title that reads \"Compensated System\":\n\t+ The title is centered at the top of the image.\n\t+ It provides context for the graph below.\n\nThe main finding from this image is that it illustrates the relationship between real and imaginary components in a compensated system, highlighting the differences between the original closed-loop pole and the new closed-loop pole. There are no significant changes or comparisons to note within this image.  \nRoot-Locus Plots of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems  \n\nThe image presents a graph with axes labeled \"Real Axis\" and \"Imag Axis\", featuring two distinct shapes: a parabola and a circle.\n\n*   **Parabolic Shape**\n    *   The parabola is located at the bottom of the y-axis, extending from approximately -0.4 to 0.4 on the x-axis.\n    *   It has a concave shape, opening upwards.\n    *   Its vertex appears to be at (0, -0.1), and it reaches its maximum height around (0, -0.05).\n*   **Circular Shape**\n    *   The circle is positioned in the middle of the graph, centered around the origin (0, 0).\n    *   It has a radius of approximately 0.2.\n    *   The circle intersects with the x-axis at two points: one on either side of the y-axis.\n\nThe graph seems to represent a mathematical relationship between real and imaginary axes, possibly related to complex numbers or functions. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the specific purpose or meaning behind this representation.  \nRoot-Locus Plot of Compensated System near the Origin   \nFigure 6–50 (a) Root-locus plots of the compensated system and uncompensated system; (b) root-locus plot of compensated system near the origin.  \n\nnear the origin.The MATLAB program to generate the root-locus plots shown in Figures 6–50(a) and (b) is given in MATLAB Program 6–11.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB script designed to generate root-locus plots of compensated and uncompensated systems. The script is organized into sections, each contributing to the creation of these plots.\n\n*   **Root-Locus Plots Generation**\n    *   The first section defines two functions: `numc` and `denc`, which represent the numerator and denominator coefficients for the uncompensated system.\n        *   These coefficients are used in the construction of the root-locus plot, indicating stability or instability characteristics without compensation.\n    *   Another function, `numcc` and `dencc`, represents the numerator and denominator coefficients for the compensated system.\n        *   These coefficients reflect changes made to improve system performance after applying compensation techniques.\n*   **Plotting Compensated System**\n    *   The script then creates a root-locus plot for both systems using the `rlocus` function from MATLAB's control systems toolbox.\n        *   This function plots the loci of roots as a parameter varies, providing insight into how the system responds to different conditions or inputs.\n*   **Plotting Uncompensated System**\n    *   Following the compensation plot, it generates the root-locus plot for the uncompensated system using similar parameters but without any modifications.\n        *   This allows for comparison between the compensated and uncompensated systems, highlighting improvements made by applying compensation techniques.\n*   **Final Plotting Command**\n    *   The final step combines both plots into a single figure, displaying them side-by-side or one above the other for easy visual comparison.\n        *   By presenting these two scenarios together, users can quickly assess the impact of compensation on system stability and performance.\n\nIn summary, this script leverages MATLAB's control systems tools to generate informative root-locus plots that compare the stability and response characteristics of both compensated and uncompensated systems.  \n\nIf the damping ratio of the new dominant closed-loop poles is kept the same, then these poles are obtained from the new root-locus plot as follows:  \n\n$$\ns_{1}=-0.31\\,+\\,j0.55,\\qquad s_{2}=-0.31\\,-\\,j0.55\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop gain $K$ is determined from the magnitude condition as follows:  \n\n$$\nK=\\left|\\frac{s(s\\mathrm{~+~}0.005)(s\\mathrm{~+~}1)(s\\mathrm{~+~}2)}{s\\mathrm{~+~}0.05}\\right|_{s=-0.31+j0.55}\n$$  \n\nThen the lag compensator gain $\\hat{K}_{c}$ is determined as  \n\n$$\n\\hat{K}_{c}=\\frac{K}{1.06}=\\frac{1.0235}{1.06}=0.9656\n$$  \n\nThus the transfer function of the lag compensator designed is  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,0.9656\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.05}{s\\,+\\,0.005}=\\,9.656\\,\\frac{20s\\,+\\,1}{200s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThen the compensated system has the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{G_{1}(s)=\\displaystyle\\frac{1.0235(s~+~0.05)}{s(s~+~0.005)(s~+~1)(s~+~2)}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{5.12(20s~+~1)}{s(200s~+~1)(s~+~1)(0.5s~+~1)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s G_{1}(s)\\,=\\,5.12\\sec^{-1}\n$$  \n\nIn the compensated system, the static velocity error constant has increased to $5.12\\ s e c^{-1}$ ,or $5.12/0.53\\,=\\,9.66$ times the original value. (The steady-state error with ramp inputs has decreased to about $10\\%$ of that of the original system.) We have essentially accomplished the design objective of increasing the static velocity error constant to $5\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ .  \n\nNote that, since the pole and zero of the lag compensator are placed close together and are located very near the origin, their effect on the shape of the original root loci has been small. Except for the presence of a small closed root locus near the origin,the root loci of the compensated and the uncompensated systems are very similar to each other.However,the value of the static velocity error constant of the compensated system is 9.66 times greater than that of the uncompensated system.  \n\nThe two other closed-loop poles for the compensated system are found as follows:  \n\n$$\ns_{3}=-2.326,\\qquad s_{4}=-0.0549\n$$  \n\nThe addition of the lag compensator increases the order of the system from 3 to 4, adding one additional closed-loop pole close to the zero of the lag compensator. (The added closed-loop pole at $s\\,=\\,-0.0549$ is close to the zero at $s\\,=\\,-0.05.$ .) Such a pair of a zero and pole creates a long tail of small amplitude in the transient response, as we will see later in the unit-step response. Since the pole at $s=-2.326$ is very far from the $j\\omega$ axis compared with the dominant closed-loop poles, the effect of this pole on the transient response is also small. Therefore, we may consider the closed-loop poles at $s\\,=\\,-0.31\\,\\pm\\,j0.55$ to be the dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\nThe undamped natural frequency of the dominant closed-loop poles of the compensated system is 0.631 rad 'sec.This value is about $6\\%$ less than the original value, 0.673 rad 'sec.This implies that the transient response of the compensated system is slower than that of the original system. The response will take a longer time to settle down.The maximum overshoot in the step response will increase in the compensated system. If such adverse effects can be tolerated, the lag compensation as discussed here presents a satisfactory solution to the given design problem.  \n\nNext, we shall compare the unit-ramp responses of the compensated system against the uncompensated system and verify that the steady-state performance is much better in the compensated system than the uncompensated system.  \n\nTo obtain the unit-ramp response with MATLAB, we use the step command for the system $C(s)/[s R(s)]$ .Since $C(s)/[s R(\\bar{s})]$ for the compensated system is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{C(s)}{s R(s)}=\\frac{1.0235(s+0.05)}{s\\big[s(s+0.005)(s+1)(s+2)+1.0235(s+0.05)\\big]}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle=\\frac{1.0235s+0.0512}{s^{5}+3.005s^{4}+2.015s^{3}+1.0335s^{2}+0.0512s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\nAlso, $C(s)/[s R(s)]$ for the uncompensated system is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\frac{C(s)}{s R(s)}=\\frac{1.06}{s\\left[s(s+1)(s+2)\\right.+\\left.1.06\\right]}}}\\\\ {{=\\frac{1.06}{s^{4}\\,+\\,3s^{3}\\,+\\,2s^{2}\\,+\\,1.06s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\textsf{n u m}=\\left[1.06\\right]}&{{}}\\\\ {\\textsf{d e n}=\\left[1\\ \\ 3\\ \\ 2\\ \\ 1.06\\ \\ 0\\right]}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 6–12 produces the plot of the unit-ramp response curves. Figure 6–51 shows the result. Clearly, the compensated system shows much smaller steady-state error (one-tenth of the original steady-state error) in following the unit-ramp input.  \n\n# MATLAB Program 6–12  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet for a MATLAB program, specifically designed to generate unit-ramp responses of compensated and uncompensated systems. The code is written in a clear and concise manner, with comments provided to explain each section's purpose.\n\n*   **Title**: The title at the top of the page reads \"MATLAB Program 6-12\" in black text.\n*   **Code Snippet**:\n    *   The code begins with a series of percent signs (%), indicating that these lines are comments and will not be executed by MATLAB.\n    *   The first line of actual code defines the unit-ramp response as the output of the compensated system, denoted by C(s).\n    *   The second line defines the uncompensated system's response, represented by U(s).\n    *   The third line calculates the difference between the two responses, resulting in a new variable D(s).\n    *   The fourth line plots the unit-ramp responses of both systems using the \"step\" function.\n    *   The fifth line displays the title and labels for the plot.\n*   **Comments**:\n    *   Comments are provided throughout the code to explain each section's purpose, making it easier for readers to understand the program's functionality.\n    *   These comments include descriptions of the unit-ramp response, uncompensated system response, difference calculation, plotting, and title display.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a MATLAB program designed to generate unit-ramp responses of compensated and uncompensated systems. The code is well-structured, with clear comments explaining each section's purpose. The program calculates and plots the unit-ramp responses of both systems, providing a visual representation of their differences. Overall, the image effectively communicates the program's functionality through its clear and concise code structure.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two lines, each representing a different system: \"Compensated System\" and \"Uncompensated System\". The graph is divided into two sections by a vertical line at x = 25. \n\n*   The left side of the graph shows the outputs c1 and c2 for both systems.\n    *   The compensated system has an output that increases steadily from approximately (0, 0) to (50, 45).\n    *   The uncompensated system also starts at (0, 0) but its output increases more slowly than the compensated system, reaching a value of around (50, 40) by t = 25.\n*   The right side of the graph displays the outputs c1 and c2 for both systems after t = 25.\n    *   Both systems continue to increase in output over time but at different rates.\n    *   By t = 50, the compensated system has an output of approximately (100, 85), while the uncompensated system's output is around (80, 75).\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates how the outputs of both systems change over time, with the compensated system performing better than the uncompensated system. 6–51 Unit-ramp responses of compensated and uncompensated systems.

[The compensator is given by Equation (6–20).]  \n\n$s\\,=\\,-0.05$ generates a long tail of small amplitude in the transient response. If a larger maximum overshoot and a slower response are not desired, we need to use a lag–lead compensator as presented in Section 6–8.  \n\nComments. It is noted that under certain circumstances, however, both lead compensator and lag compensator may satisfy the given specifications (both transientresponse specifications and steady-state specifications.) Then either compensation may be used.  \n\n# 6–8 LAG–LEAD COMPENSATION  \n\nLead compensation basically speeds up the response and increases the stability of the system. Lag compensation improves the steady-state accuracy of the system, but reduces the speed of the response.  \n\nIf improvements in both transient response and steady-state response are desired, then both a lead compensator and a lag compensator may be used simultaneously.Rather than introducing both a lead compensator and a lag compensator as separate units, however, it is economical to use a single lag–lead compensator.  \n\nLag–lead compensation combines the advantages of lag and lead compensations. Since the lag–lead compensator possesses two poles and two zeros, such a compensation increases the order of the system by 2, unless cancellation of pole(s) and zero(s) occurs in the compensated system.  \n\nElectronic Lag–Lead Compensator Using Operational Amplifiers.

(Infinitely many sets of $T_{1}$ and $\\gamma$ are possible.) Then determine the value of $K_{c}$ from the magnitude condition:  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}{s_{1}+\\frac{\\gamma}{T_{1}}}G(s_{1})\\Bigg|\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\n4.

Hence, given the value of $K_{v}$ , the value of $\\beta$ can be determined from this last equation. Then, using the value of $\\beta$ thus determined, choose the value of $T_{2}$ such that  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}\\right|\\doteq1\n$$  \n\n$$\n-5^{\\circ}<\\left\\langle\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}<0^{\\circ}\\right.\n$$  \n\n(The preceding design procedure is illustrated in Example 6–8.)  \n\nCase 2. $\\gamma=\\beta$ .If $\\gamma=\\beta$ is required in Equation (6–23), then the preceeding design procedure for the lag–lead compensator may be modified as follows:  \n\n1.

The lag–lead compensator given by Equation (6–23) is modified to  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\,{\\frac{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}{\\displaystyle{\\left({\\frac{T_{1}}{\\beta}}\\,s\\,+\\,1\\right)}(\\beta T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}}=\\,K_{c}\\,{\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}\\right)}\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}\\right)}{\\displaystyle{\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{\\beta}{T_{1}}}\\right)}\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}\\right)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta>1$ .The open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ .If the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is specified, determine the value of constant $K_{c}$ from the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)}}\\\\ {{\\ =\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s K_{c}G(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n3. To have the dominant closed-loop poles at the desired location, calculate the angle contribution $\\phi$ needed from the phase-lead portion of the lag–lead compensator.  \n\n4. For the lag–lead compensator, we later choose $T_{2}$ sufficiently large so that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}\n$$  \n\nis approximately unity, where $s\\,=\\,s_{1}$ is one of the dominant closed-loop poles. Determine the values of $T_{1}$ and $\\beta$ from the magnitude and angle conditions:  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\Bigg(\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}{s_{1}+\\frac{\\beta}{T_{1}}}\\Bigg)G(s_{1})\\Bigg|\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\left\\langle{\\frac{s_{1}+{\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}}{s_{1}+{\\frac{\\beta}{T_{1}}}}}=\\phi\n$$  \n\n5. Using the value of $\\beta$ just determined, choose $T_{2}$ so that  \n\n$$\n\\left.{\\frac{s_{1}+{\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}}{s_{1}+{\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}}}\\right|_{\\div}+1\n$$  \n\n$$\n-5^{\\circ}<\\left\\langle\\frac{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s_{1}+\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}<0^{\\circ}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe value of $\\beta T_{2}$ ,the largest time constant of the lag–lead compensator, should not be too large to be physically realized. (An example of the design of the lag–lead compensator when $\\gamma=\\beta$ is given in Example 6–9.)  \n\nConsider the control system shown in Figure 6–55.The feedforward transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{4}{s(s+0.5)}}\n$$  \n\nThis system has closed-loop poles at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-0.2500\\,\\pm\\,j1.9843\n$$  \n\nThe damping ratio is 0.125, the undamped natural frequency is 2 rad/sec, and the static velocity error constant is $8\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ .  \n\nIt is desired to make the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles equal to 0.5 and to increase the undamped natural frequency to 5 rad 'sec and the static velocity error constant to $80\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ . Design an appropriate compensator to meet all the performance specifications.  \n\nLet us assume that we use a lag–lead compensator having the transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\left(\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}{s+\\frac{\\gamma}{T_{1}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}\\right)\\qquad(\\gamma>1,\\beta>1)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is not equal to $\\beta$ .Then the compensated system will have the open-loop transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)=K_{c}\\left({\\frac{s+{\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}}{s+{\\frac{\\gamma}{T_{1}}}}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{s+{\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}}{s+{\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}}}\\right)G(s)\n$$  \n\nFrom the performance specifications, the dominant closed-loop poles must be at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-2.50\\,\\pm\\,j4.33\n$$  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\left/{\\frac{4}{s(s\\,+\\,0.5)}}\\,\\right|_{s=-2.50+j4.33}=-235^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nthe phase-lead portion of the lag–lead compensator must contribute $55^{\\circ}$ so that the root locus passes through the desired location of the dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\nTo design the phase-lead portion of the compensator, we first determine the location of the zero and pole that will give $55^{\\circ}$ contribution. There are many possible choices, but we shall here choose the zero at $s\\,=\\,-0.5$ so that this zero will cancel the pole at $s=-0.5$ of the plant. Once the zero is chosen, the pole can be located such that the angle contribution is $55^{\\circ}$ . By simple calculation or graphical analysis, the pole must be located at $s\\,=\\,-5.02$ .Thus, the phase-lead portion of the lag–lead compensator becomes  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation and its corresponding block diagram, which is likely used to represent a control system or signal processing circuit.\n\n*   The top half of the image displays an equation with variables Kc, s, T1, γ, and T2.\n    *   This equation appears to be describing a relationship between these variables in terms of their mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n    *   Without additional context or information about what each variable represents, it's challenging to provide further details on the specific meaning behind this equation.\n*   The bottom half of the image shows a block diagram with various components connected by arrows.\n    *   This block diagram illustrates how different parts of a system interact with one another.\n    *   Each component in the block diagram corresponds to an element or operation within the mathematical equation above it.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a mathematical equation that describes relationships between variables and their operations, alongside a block diagram that visually represents these same elements in terms of their interactions. The exact nature and purpose of this representation depend on the specific context and application being considered. 6–55 Control system.  \n\nThus  \n\n$$\nT_{1}=2,~~~~~~\\gamma=\\frac{5.02}{0.5}=10.04\n$$  \n\nNext we determine the value of $K_{c}$ from the magnitude condition:  \n\n$$\n\\left|K_{c}\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.5}{s\\,+\\,5.02}\\frac{4}{s(s\\,+\\,0.5)}\\right|_{s=-2.5+j4.33}\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\left|\\frac{(s\\,+\\,5.02)s}{4}\\right|_{s=-2.5+j4.33}=\\,6.26\n$$  \n\nThe phase-lag portion of the compensator can be designed as follows: First the value of $\\beta$ is determined to satisfy the requirement on the static velocity error constant:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K_{v}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s K_{c}\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\,G(s)}}\\\\ {{\\,\\,\\,}}\\\\ {{=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s(6.26)\\,\\displaystyle\\frac{\\beta}{10.04}\\frac{4}{s(s+0.5)}=4.988\\beta=80}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence, $\\beta$ is determined as  \n\n$$\n\\beta=16.04\n$$  \n\nFinally, we choose the value $T_{2}$ such that the following two conditions are satisfied:  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s+\\frac{1}{16.04T_{2}}}\\right|_{s=-2.5+j4.33}\\ \\doteq1,\\qquad-5^{\\circ}<\\left|\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}{s+\\frac{1}{16.04T_{2}}\\right|_{s=-2.5+j4.33}}<0^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nWe may choose several values for $T_{2}$ and check if the magnitude and angle conditions are satisfied.After simple calculations we find for $T_{2}=5$  \n\n$$\n1>\\mathrm{magnitude}>0.98,~~~~~~~~~-2.10^{\\circ}<\\mathrm{angle}<0^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nSince $T_{2}=5$ satisfies the two conditions, we may choose  \n\n$$\nT_{2}=5\n$$  \n\nNow the transfer function of the designed lag–lead compensator is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,(6.26)\\left(\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{2}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{10.04}{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{5}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{16.04\\times5}}\\right)}\\\\ {\\displaystyle}\\\\ {\\displaystyle}\\\\ {\\,=\\,6.26\\bigg(\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.5}{s\\,+\\,5.02}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.2}{s\\,+\\,0.01247}\\bigg)}\\\\ {\\displaystyle}\\\\ {\\displaystyle}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe compensated system will have the open-loop transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\frac{25.04(s\\,+\\,0.2)}{s(s\\,+\\,5.02)(s\\,+\\,0.01247)}\n$$  \n\nBecause of the cancellation of the $(s+0.5)$ terms,the compensated system is a third-order system. (Mathematically, this cancellation is exact, but practically such cancellation will not be exact because some approximations are usually involved in deriving the mathematical model of the system and, as a result, the time constants are not precise.) The root-locus plot of the compensated system is shown in Figure 6–56(a).An enlarged view of the root-locus plot near the origin is shown in Figure 6–56(b). Because the angle contribution of the phase lag portion of the lag–lead compensator is quite small, there is only a small change in the location of the dominant closedloop poles from the desired location, $s=-2.5\\,\\pm\\,j4.33$ .The characteristic equation for the compensated system is  \n\n$$\ns(s\\,+\\,5.02)(s\\,+\\,0.01247)\\,+\\,25.04(s\\,+\\,0.2)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,5.0325s^{2}\\,+\\,25.1026s\\,+\\,5.008\n$$  \n\n$$\n=(s\\,+\\,2.4123\\,+\\,j4.2756)(s\\,+\\,2.4123\\,-\\,j4.2756)(s\\,+\\,0.2078)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nHence the new closed-loop poles are located at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-2.4123\\,\\pm\\,j4.2756\n$$  \n\nThe new damping ratio is $\\zeta=0.491$ .Therefore the compensated system meets all the required performance specifications. The third closed-loop pole of the compensated system is located at $s=-0.2078$ .Since this closed-loop pole is very close to the zero at $s=-0.2$ ,the effect of this pole on the response is small. (Note that, in general, if a pole and a zero lie close to each other on the negative real axis near the origin, then such a pole-zero combination will yield a long tail of small amplitude in the transient response.)  \n\nThe image presents a Root-Locus Plot of a Compensated System, which is a graphical representation used to analyze and design control systems.

The plot displays the behavior of the system's poles in the complex plane, with two poles initially plotted at (-5+0j) and (0-5j). After applying a compensator, two new poles are added at (-2+2j) and (2+2j), resulting in four poles in total. The loci of these poles under various gain settings are plotted as solid lines connecting the poles in each quadrant.  \n  \nFigure 6–56 (a) Root-locus plot of the compensated system; (b) root-locus plot near the origin.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, the x-axis and y-axis. The x-axis is labeled \"RealAxis\" and ranges from -0.5 to 0.25, while the y-axis is labeled \"Imag Axis\" and spans from -0.25 to 0.25.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Circle:** A circle with a radius of approximately 1 unit centered at the origin (0, 0) on the graph.\n*   **Axes Labels:** The x-axis is labeled as \"RealAxis,\" indicating that it represents the real part of complex numbers. Similarly, the y-axis is labeled as \"Imag Axis,\" signifying that it represents the imaginary part of complex numbers.\n*   **Range:** The range of values on both axes is from -0.5 to 0.25 for RealAxis and from -0.25 to 0.25 for Imag Axis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph appears to be a representation of the complex plane, with the x-axis representing the real part and the y-axis representing the imaginary part of complex numbers. The circle likely represents some mathematical concept or relationship involving these axes, but without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine its specific meaning.  \n\nThe graph shows unit-step responses of compensated and uncompensated systems. The y-axis is labeled 'Outputs' with values ranging from 0 to 1.8, while the x-axis represents time in seconds, spanning from 0 to 8.\n\n**Graph Description:**\n\n*   Two curves are plotted on the graph:\n    *   **Uncompensated System:** This curve has a steeper slope at the start and reaches its peak output value faster than the compensated system. However, it also drops off more rapidly, resulting in a lower steady-state value compared to the compensated system.\n    *   **Compensated System:** The curve for this system starts with a gentler slope but takes longer to reach its maximum output value. It then settles at a higher steady-state value than the uncompensated system.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   Both curves start from zero and increase over time, indicating that both systems respond to the input signal.\n*   The uncompensated system reaches its peak output value faster but drops off more rapidly, resulting in a lower steady-state value.\n*   In contrast, the compensated system takes longer to reach its maximum output value but settles at a higher steady-state value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph illustrates the differences in unit-step responses between an uncompensated and a compensated system. The compensated system exhibits better stability and accuracy by reaching a higher steady-state value while maintaining a more consistent output over time.  \nUnit-Ramp Responses of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems  \n\nThe image presents a line graph comparing the outputs of two systems, one compensated and one uncompensated. The graph is labeled \"Outputs\" on the y-axis and \"t Sec\" on the x-axis.\n\n*   **Steady-state error of compensated system = 0.0125**\n    *   This section provides information about the steady-state error of the compensated system.\n    *   The steady-state error is a measure of how well the system can track changes in its input over time.\n    *   A lower steady-state error indicates better performance and stability.\n*   **Steady-state error of uncompensated system = 0.125**\n    *   This section provides information about the steady-state error of the uncompensated system.\n    *   The steady-state error is a measure of how well the system can track changes in its input over time.\n    *   A lower steady-state error indicates better performance and stability.\n*   **Compensated system**\n    *   This section highlights the compensated system's performance.\n    *   The compensated system has a lower steady-state error compared to the uncompensated system, indicating improved stability and tracking ability.\n    *   The compensated system's output is closer to the ideal response, demonstrating better overall performance.\n*   **Uncompensated system**\n    *   This section highlights the uncompensated system's performance.\n    *   The uncompensated system has a higher steady-state error compared to the compensated system, indicating reduced stability and tracking ability.\n    *   The uncompensated system's output deviates further from the ideal response, demonstrating poorer overall performance.\n\nIn summary, the graph effectively illustrates the advantages of using compensation techniques in control systems. By comparing the outputs of the compensated and uncompensated systems, it is clear that compensation significantly improves the system's ability to track changes in its input over time, leading to better stability and performance. 6–57 Transient-response curves for the compensated system and uncompensated system.

The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" (real part), while the y-axis is labeled \"Im\" (imaginary part). A complex number z can be expressed as z = Re + Imi.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Origin:** The origin of the graph is located at the point (0, 0).\n*   **Complex Number Plotting:** The complex number is plotted using two perpendicular lines that extend from the origin. The x-axis represents the real part of the complex number, and the y-axis represents the imaginary part.\n*   **Magnitude:** The magnitude of the complex number is represented by the distance between the origin and the point where the two perpendicular lines intersect.\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n*   **Complex Number Representation:** The graph provides a visual representation of how to plot a complex number on a plane, making it easier to understand and work with these numbers in mathematics and engineering.\n*   **Applications:** This type of graph is commonly used in electrical engineering to represent impedance and admittance, as well as in other fields such as signal processing and control systems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image effectively illustrates the concept of plotting a complex number on a plane, providing a clear understanding of how to represent these numbers using graphical methods. 6–58 Determination of the desired pole-zero location.  \n\nBy simple calculations, we find that if we choose $T_{2}=5$ , then  \n\n$$\n1>\\mathrm{magnitude}>0.98,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;-1.5^{\\circ}<\\mathrm{{\\;angle}<0^{\\circ}}\n$$  \n\nand if we choose $T_{2}=10$ , then  \n\n$$\n1>\\mathrm{magnitude}>0.99,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;-1^{\\circ}<\\mathrm{angle}<0^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nSince $T_{2}$ is one of the time constants of the lag–lead compensator, it should not be too large. If $T_{2}=10$ can be acceptable from practical viewpoint, then we may choose $T_{2}=10.$ . Then  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}=\\frac{1}{3.503\\times10}=0.0285\n$$  \n\nThus, the lag–lead compensator becomes  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,(10)\\bigg(\\frac{s\\,+\\,2.38}{s\\,+\\,8.34}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.1}{s\\,+\\,0.0285}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nThe compensated system will have the open-loop transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\frac{40(s\\,+\\,2.38)(s\\,+\\,0.1)}{(s\\,+\\,8.34)(s\\,+\\,0.0285)s(s\\,+\\,0.5)}\n$$  \n\nNo cancellation occurs in this case, and the compensated system is of fourth order. Because the angle contribution of the phase lag portion of the lag–lead network is quite small, the dominant closed-loop poles are located very near the desired location. In fact, the location of the dominant closed-loop poles can be found from the characteristic equation as follows: The characteristic equation of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\n(s\\,+\\,8.34)(s\\,+\\,0.0285)s(s\\,+\\,0.5)\\,+\\,40(s\\,+\\,2.38)(s\\,+\\,0.1)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwhich can be simplified to  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{s^{4}+8.8685s^{3}+44.4219s^{2}+99.3188s+9.52}\\\\ &{=(s+2.4539+j4.3099)(s+2.4539-j4.3099)(s+0.1003)(s+3.8604)=0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThe dominant closed-loop poles are located at  \n\n$$\ns=-2.4539\\,\\pm\\,j4.3099\n$$  \n\nThe other closed-loop poles are located at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-0.1003;\\qquad s\\,=\\,-3.8604\n$$  \n\nSince the closed-loop pole at $s\\,=\\,-0.1003$ is very close to a zero at $s=-0.1$ ,they almost cancel each other.Thus, the effect of this closed-loop pole is very small.The remaining closed-loop pole ($s=-3.8604\\$ )does not quite cancel the zero at $s=-2.4.$ .The effect of this zero is to cause a larger overshoot in the step response than a similar system without such a zero. The unit-step response curves of the compensated and uncompensated systems are shown in Figure 6–59(a).The unit-ramp response curves for both systems are depicted in Figure 6–59(b).  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the unit-step responses of compensated and uncompensated systems. The graph features two lines, one representing the compensated system and the other representing the uncompensated system.\n\n*   **Compensated System:**\n    *   The compensated system is represented by a solid black line.\n    *   It exhibits a rapid initial response, followed by a gradual decrease in output as time progresses.\n    *   The graph indicates that the compensated system reaches its maximum output value at approximately 1.5 seconds.\n*   **Uncompensated System:**\n    *   The uncompensated system is represented by a dotted black line.\n    *   It displays a slower initial response compared to the compensated system, with a more gradual increase in output over time.\n    *   The graph shows that the uncompensated system reaches its maximum output value at around 3 seconds.\n\nIn summary, the graph effectively compares the unit-step responses of compensated and uncompensated systems, highlighting their differences in terms of response speed and output values.  \nUnit-Ramp Responses of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems  \n\nThe image presents a line graph comparing the performance of two systems, labeled as \"Compensated System\" and \"Uncompensated System.\" The x-axis represents time in seconds (t Sec), while the y-axis displays outputs ranging from 0 to 4.\n\n**Graph Features:**\n\n*   **Lines:** Two lines are plotted on the graph:\n    *   A black line representing the uncompensated system\n    *   A gray line representing the compensated system\n*   **Labels:** The x and y axes are labeled accordingly:\n    *   X-axis (bottom): t Sec\n    *   Y-axis (left): Outputs\n*   **Data Points:** No data points or markers are visible on the graph.\n*   **Scale:** The scale of both axes is uniform, with each major tick mark representing a value of 0.5 for the x-axis and 1 for the y-axis.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   The compensated system consistently outputs higher values than the uncompensated system throughout the observed time period.\n*   The difference between the two systems' outputs increases as time progresses, indicating that the compensation has a more significant impact on performance at longer durations.\n*   There are no visible data points or markers to indicate specific times or output values for either system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph illustrates the comparative performance of compensated and uncompensated systems over time. The compensated system outperforms its uncompensated counterpart, with the difference in outputs increasing as time elapses. However, without additional context or information about the nature of these systems or their intended applications, it is challenging to draw more specific conclusions from this data alone. 6–59 (a) Unit-step response curves for the compensated and uncompensated systems; (b) unit-ramp response curves for both systems.  \n\nThe maximum overshoot in the step response of the compensated system is approximately $38\\%$ . (This is much larger than the maximum overshoot of $21\\%$ in the design presented in Example 6–8.) It is possible to decrease the maximum overshoot by a small amount from $38\\%$ , but not to $20\\%$ if $\\gamma=\\beta$ is required, as in this example. Note that by not requiring $\\gamma=\\beta$ , we have an additional parameter to play with and thus can reduce the maximum overshoot.  \n\n# 6–9 PARALLEL COMPENSATION  \n\nThus far we have presented series compensation techniques using lead, lag, or lag–lead compensators.In this section we discuss parallel compensation technique.Because in the parallel compensation design the controller (or compensator) is in a minor loop, the design may seem to be more complicated than in the series compensation case. It is, however, not complicated if we rewrite the characteristic equation to be of the same form as the characteristic equation for the series compensated system. In this section we present a simple design problem involving parallel compensation.  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C}{R}=\\frac{G_{c}G}{1+G_{c}G H}\n$$  \n\nBasic Principle for Designing Parallel Compensated System. Referring to Figure 6–60(a), the closed-loop transfer function for the system with series compensation is  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G_{c}G H\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nGiven $G$ and $H$ , the design problem becomes that of determining the compensator $G_{c}$ that satisfies the given specification.  \n\nThe image presents two flowcharts, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to illustrate a system or process involving various components. The charts are composed of boxes representing different elements and arrows indicating the flow of information between them.\n\n*   **Chart (a)**:\n    *   The chart consists of six boxes: R, Gc(s), G(s), H(s), C, and an additional box labeled G1(s).\n    *   Arrows connect these boxes in a specific order, suggesting a sequential process.\n    *   Notably, the boxes are connected to form a loop, indicating a feedback mechanism within the system.\n*   **Chart (b)**:\n    *   This chart also features six boxes: R, Gc(s), H(s), G1(s), C, and another box labeled G2(s).\n    *   Similar to Chart (a), the boxes are connected by arrows in a specific sequence.\n    *   The presence of loops in both charts implies that the system is designed to monitor and adjust its performance based on feedback from the output.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts two flowcharts representing a system or process with multiple components and feedback mechanisms. While the exact nature of these systems cannot be determined without additional context, they appear to involve some form of control or regulation based on input data (R) and output results (C). 6–60 (a) Series compensation; (b) parallel or feedback compensation.  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function for the system with parallel compensation [Figure 6–60(b)] is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C}{R}=\\frac{G_{1}G_{2}}{1\\,+\\,G_{2}G_{c}\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}H}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}H\\,+\\,G_{2}G_{c}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nBy dividing this characteristic equation by the sum of the terms that do not involve $G_{c}$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,\\frac{G_{c}G_{2}}{1\\,+\\,G_{1}G_{2}H}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nIf we define  \n\n$$\nG_{f}=\\frac{G_{2}}{1+G_{1}G_{2}H}\n$$  \n\nthen Equation (6–25) becomes  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G_{c}G_{f}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nSince $G_{f}$ is a fixed transfer function, the design of $G_{c}$ becomes the same as the case of series compensation. Hence the same design approach applies to the parallel compensated system.  \n\nVelocity Feedback Systems. A velocity feedback system (tachometer feedback system) is an example of parallel compensated systems.The controller (or compensator) in such a system is a gain element.The gain of the feedback element in a minor loop must be determined properly so that the entire system satisfies the given design specifications.The characteristic of such a velocity feedback system is that the variable parameter does not appear as a multiplying factor in the open-loop transfer function, so that direct application of the root-locus design technique is not possible. However, by rewriting the characteristic equation such that the variable parameter appears as a multiplying factor, then the root-locus approach to the design is possible.  \n\nAn example of control system design using parallel compensation technique is presented in Example 6–10.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 6–10  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 6–61. Draw a root-locus diagram.Then determine the value of $k$ such that the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles is 0.4.  \n\nHere the system involves velocity feedback.The open-loop transfer function is  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the transfer function of a control system. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the input section and the output section.\n\n**Input Section**\n\n*   A signal, represented by an arrow labeled \"R(s)\", enters the system from the left side.\n*   This signal passes through a summer, denoted by the symbol \"+\" inside a circle with a cross on top.\n*   The summer combines the input signal with another signal generated within the system.\n\n**Output Section**\n\n*   The combined signal is then processed by a transfer function block labeled \"20/(s + 1)(s + 4)\".\n*   This block represents the dynamics of the control system and determines how it responds to changes in the input signal.\n*   The processed signal emerges from this block and enters another transfer function block labeled \"k\".\n*   This additional processing step allows for further refinement or adjustment of the output signal.\n\n**Key Components**\n\n*   **R(s)**: The input signal entering the system.\n*   **20/(s + 1)(s + 4)**: The primary transfer function block, representing the core dynamics of the control system.\n*   **k**: An additional processing step that refines or adjusts the output signal.\n*   **C(s)**: The final output signal leaving the system.\n\n**Overall Structure**\n\nThe diagram outlines a basic structure for a control system, where an input signal is processed through a series of transfer functions to produce an output signal. This setup allows for the design and analysis of control systems using Laplace transform techniques. 6–61 Control system.  \n\nNotice that the adjustable variable $k$ does not appear as a multiplying factor.

Notice that the open-loop poles are located at $s\\,=\\,j2,s\\,=\\,-j2,s\\,=\\,-5$ ,and the open-loop zero is located at $s\\,=\\,0$ .The root locus exists on the real axis between 0 and $^{-5}$ .Since  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\infty}{\\frac{K s}{(s\\,+\\,j2)(s\\,-\\,j2)(s\\,+\\,5)}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\infty}{\\frac{K}{s^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Angles\\;of\\;asymptote}\\;=\\frac{\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k\\:+\\:1)}{2}=\\;\\pm\\:90^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe intersection of the asymptotes with the real axis can be found from  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\frac{K s}{s^{3}\\,+\\,5s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,20}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\frac{K}{s^{2}\\,+\\,5s\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\frac{K}{(s\\,+\\,2.5)^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nas  \n\n$$\ns=-2.5\n$$  \n\nThe angle of departure (angle $\\theta$ ) from the pole at $s\\,=\\,j2$ is obtained as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\theta\\,=\\,180^{\\circ}\\,-\\,90^{\\circ}\\,-\\,21.8^{\\circ}\\,+\\,90^{\\circ}\\,=\\,158.2^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThus, the angle of departure from the pole $s\\,=\\,j2$ is $158.2^{\\circ}$ . Figure 6–62 shows a root-locus plot for the system. Notice that two branches of the root locus originate from the poles at $s=\\pm j2$ and terminate on the zeros at infinity. The remaining one branch originates from the pole at $s=-5$ and terminates on the zero at $s\\,=\\,0$ .  \n\nNote that the closed-loop poles with $\\zeta=0.4$ must lie on straight lines passing through the origin and making the angles $\\pm66.42^{\\circ}$ with the negative real axis. In the present case, there are two intersections of the root-locus branch in the upper half $s$ plane and the straight line of angle $66.42^{\\circ}$ .Thus,two values of $K$ will give the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of the closed-loop poles equal to 0.4.At point $P$ ,the value of $K$ is  \n\n$$\nK=\\left.\\left|\\frac{(s\\,+\\,j2)(s\\,-\\,j2)(s\\,+\\,5)}{s}\\right|_{s=-1.0490+j2.4065}=8.9801\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nk={\\frac{K}{20}}=0.4490\\qquad{\\mathrm{at~point~}}P\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical diagram, comprising multiple components that convey intricate relationships between various variables.

By analyzing its components, one can gain insights into the properties and behaviors of these mathematical constructs. 6–62 Root-locus plot for the system shown in Figure 6–61.  \n\nAt point $Q$ , the value of $K$ is  \n\n$$\nK=\\left.\\left|\\frac{(s\\,+\\,j2)(s\\,-\\,j2)(s\\,+\\,5)}{s}\\right|_{s=-2.1589+j4.9652}=28.260\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nk={\\frac{K}{20}}=1.4130\\qquad{\\mathrm{at~point}}\\,Q\n$$  \n\nThus, we have two solutions for this problem.

This is evident, because the original system shown in Figure 6–61 does not have a closed-loop zero, since  \n\n$$\n\\frac{G(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{20}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)\\,+\\,20(1\\,+\\,k s)}\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop zero at $s\\,=\\,0$ was introduced in the process of modifying the characteristic equation such that the adjustable variable $K=20k$ was to appear as a multiplying factor.  \n\nWe have obtained two different values of $k$ to satisfy the requirement that the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles be equal to 0.4.

In this case, the response characteristic is primarily determined by the real closed-loop pole.  \n\nLet us compare the unit-step responses of both systems. MATLAB Program 6–14 may be used for plotting the unit-step response curves in one diagram. The resulting unit-step response curves $\\bar{[c_{1}(t)}$ for $k\\,=\\,0.4490$ and $c_{2}(t)$ for $k=1.4130^{^{\\circ}}$ are shown in Figure 6–63.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for generating unit-step responses of two systems. The code is written in black text on a white background and includes comments that explain the purpose of each section.\n\n*   **Header**\n    *   The first line of the code reads `MATLAB Program 6-14`, which suggests that this is an assignment or exercise from a textbook or course.\n    *   Below the title, there are two blank lines followed by `%` symbols, indicating comments in MATLAB.\n*   **Comments and Header**\n    *   The next section of code starts with `%%` symbols, which indicate comments in MATLAB.\n    *   These comments explain that the program will generate unit-step responses of two systems using the transfer functions `[1 s+2]/[s^3 + 4*s^2 + 5*s + 6]` and `[s+3]/[s^3 - s^2 - 10*s - 12]`.\n*   **Transfer Functions**\n    *   The next section of code defines the transfer functions for the two systems using the `tf` function.\n    *   The first transfer function is defined as `[1 s+2]/[s^3 + 4*s^2 + 5*s + 6]`, and the second transfer function is defined as `[s+3]/[s^3 - s^2 - 10*s - 12]`.\n*   **Unit-Step Response**\n    *   The next section of code uses the `lsim` function to generate the unit-step response of each system.\n    *   The output of the first system is stored in the variable `y1`, and the output of the second system is stored in the variable `y2`.\n*   **Plotting**\n    *   The final section of code uses the `plot` function to plot the unit-step responses of both systems.\n    *   The resulting plots are displayed on a single graph, with the first system's response shown as a solid line and the second system's response shown as a dashed line.\n\nOverall, this program generates the unit-step responses of two systems and plots them together for comparison.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with two curves, each representing the outputs of two different functions. The x-axis is labeled \"t Sec\" and ranges from 0 to 10 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled \"Outputs e1 and e2\" and spans from 0 to 1.2.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   Two curved lines are plotted on the graph.\n    *   One curve has a peak at approximately 0.8 on the y-axis around t = 2 seconds, then gradually decreases towards the end of the time period shown.\n    *   The other curve increases steadily from approximately 0.4 on the y-axis until it reaches its maximum value just after t = 3 seconds and remains there for some time before decreasing back down to its starting point by the end of the time period shown.\n*   A small grid pattern is visible in the background, which may be intended to aid in reading off specific values from the graph but does not significantly impact the overall appearance or meaning of the plot.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe line graph provides a visual representation of two functions over a specified time period. The curves exhibit distinct behaviors, with one peaking and then decreasing, while the other steadily increases before reaching its maximum value and gradually decreasing back down to its starting point by the end of the time period shown. 6–63 Unit-step response curves for the system shown in Figure 6–61 when the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of the dominant closedloop poles is set equal to 0.4. (Two possible values of $k$ give the damping ratio $\\zeta$ equal to 0.4.)  \n\nFrom Figure 6–63 we notice that the response of the system with $k\\,=\\,0.4490$ is oscillatory. (The effect of the closed-loop pole at $s\\,=\\,-2.9021$ on the unit-step response is small.) For the system with $k=1.4130$ ,the oscillations due to the closed-loop poles at $s\\,=\\,-2.1589\\,\\pm\\,j4.9652$ damp out much faster than purely exponential response due to the closed-loop pole at $s=-0.6823$ .  \n\nThe system with $k\\,=\\,0.4490$ (which exhibits a faster response with relatively small overshoot) has a much better response characteristic than the system with $k=1.4130$ (which exhibits a slow overdamped response).Therefore, we should choose $k\\,=\\,0.4490$ for the present system.  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–6–1. Sketch the root loci for the system shown in Figure 6–64(a). (The gain $K$ is assumed to be positive.) Observe that for small or large values of $K$ the system is overdamped and for medium values of $K$ it is underdamped.  \n\nSolution. The procedure for plotting the root loci is as follows:  \n\n1. Locate the open-loop poles and zeros on the complex plane. Root loci exist on the negative real axis between 0 and $-1$ and between $^{-2}$ and $^{-3}$ .  \n2. The number of open-loop poles and that of finite zeros are the same.This means that there are no asymptotes in the complex region of the $s$ plane.   \n3. Determine the breakaway and break-in points.The characteristic equation for the system is  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,{\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}}=0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,\\frac{s(s\\,+\\,1)}{(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical concept, likely related to signal processing or control systems. The diagram is divided into two sections: a flowchart at the top and a graph at the bottom.\n\n**Flowchart:**\n\n*   The flowchart consists of three rectangular boxes connected by arrows.\n*   Each box contains an equation or formula:\n    *   The first box has the equation \"R(s)\" with an arrow pointing to the second box.\n    *   The second box has the equation \"K(s+2)\" with an arrow pointing to the third box.\n    *   The third box has the equation \"(s+3)/(s+1)\" with no arrows leaving it.\n*   Above the flowchart, there is a circle with a cross inside it, labeled \"R(s)\".\n\n**Graph:**\n\n*   Below the flowchart is a graph featuring a circle and several lines and symbols.\n*   The circle has two points marked on its circumference:\n    *   One point is at -3 on the x-axis and 14 on the y-axis (K=14).\n    *   Another point is at -2 on the x-axis and 0.0718 on the y-axis (K=0.0718).\n*   The graph also includes several lines, including a horizontal line at y=-1, a vertical line at x=-1, and a diagonal line from (-3,-14) to (-2,-0.0718).\n\n**Overall:**\n\n*   The image appears to be a visual representation of a mathematical concept or algorithm.\n*   The flowchart likely represents the steps involved in applying this concept, while the graph may represent the output or results of these steps.\n*   The presence of complex equations and formulas suggests that the concept being represented is advanced and technical. 6–64 (a) Control system; (b) root-locus plot.  \n\nThe breakaway and break-in points are determined from  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{d K}{d s}=-\\,\\frac{(2s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)\\,-\\,s(s\\,+\\,1)(2s\\,+\\,5)}{\\big[(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)\\big]^{2}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\qquad=-\\,\\frac{4(s\\,+\\,0.634)(s\\,+\\,2.366)}{\\big[(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)\\big]^{2}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\qquad=\\,0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nas follows:  \n\n$$\ns\\,=-0.634,\\qquad s\\,=-2.366\n$$  \n\nNotice that both points are on root loci. Therefore, they are actual breakaway or break-in points.At point $s=-0.634$ ,the value of $K$ is  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,{\\frac{(-0.634)(0.366)}{(1.366)(2.366)}}=0.0718\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, at $s=-2.366$ ,  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,{\\frac{(-2.366)(-1.366)}{(-0.366)(0.634)}}=14\n$$  \n\n(Because point $s=-0.634$ lies between two poles, it is a breakaway point, and because point $s=-2.366$ lies between two zeros, it is a break-in point.)  \n\n4. Determine a sufficient number of points that satisfy the angle condition. (It can be found that the root loci involve a circle with center at $-1.5$ that passes through the breakaway and break-in points.) The root-locus plot for this system is shown in Figure 6–64(b).  \n\nNote that this system is stable for any positive value of $K$ since all the root loci lie in the lefthalf $s$ plane.  \n\nSmall values of $K$ ($0<K<0.0718)$ )correspond to an overdamped system. Medium values of $K$ $(0.0718<K<14)$ )correspond to an underdamped system. Finally, large values of $K$ $(14<K)$ )correspond to an overdamped system.With a large value of $K$ , the steady state can be reached in much shorter time than with a small value of $K$ .  \n\nThe value of $K$ should be adjusted so that system performance is optimum according to a given performance index.  \n\nA–6–2. Sketch the root loci for the system shown in Figure 6–65(a).  \n\nSolution. A root locus exists on the real axis between points $s=-1$ and $s=-3.6$ .The asymptotes can be determined as follows:  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Angles~of~asymptotes}}={\\frac{\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k+1)}{3-1}}=90^{\\circ},-90^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe intersection of the asymptotes and the real axis is found from  \n\n$$\ns\\,=-\\,{\\frac{0\\,+\\,0\\,+\\,3.6\\,-\\,1}{3\\,-\\,1}}=-1.3\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a diagram of a control system, comprising two primary components: (a) a block diagram and (b) a frequency response plot. The block diagram illustrates the flow of signals through the system, while the frequency response plot displays the magnitude and phase shift of the output signal as a function of frequency.\n\n**Block Diagram:**\n\n*   The block diagram consists of several blocks, each representing a different component or operation within the system.\n*   The input signal is represented by an arrow pointing into the first block.\n*   The output signal from each block is represented by an arrow pointing out of that block and into the next one in the sequence.\n*   The system includes filters, amplifiers, and other components to manipulate the signal before it reaches its final destination.\n\n**Frequency Response Plot:**\n\n*   The frequency response plot shows how the magnitude and phase shift of the output signal change as the input frequency increases or decreases.\n*   The x-axis represents the logarithm of the frequency, while the y-axis represents both the magnitude (in decibels) and phase shift (in degrees).\n*   The plot reveals that at low frequencies, the magnitude is high and the phase shift is small, but as the frequency increases, the magnitude decreases and the phase shift becomes larger.\n\nIn summary, the diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the control system's architecture and its performance characteristics. It highlights the various components involved in processing the input signal and their impact on the output signal's magnitude and phase shift across different frequencies.  \n\n# Figure 6–65  \n\n(a) Control system; (b) root-locus plot.  \n\nSince the characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,3.6s^{2}\\,+\\,K(s\\,+\\,1)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\nK=-\\,\\frac{s^{3}\\,+\\,3.6s^{2}}{s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe breakaway and break-in points are found from  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d K}{d s}}=-\\,{\\frac{\\left(3s^{2}\\,+\\,7.2s\\right)\\!(s\\,+\\,1)\\,-\\,\\left(s^{3}\\,+\\,3.6s^{2}\\right)}{(s\\,+\\,1)^{2}}}=0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,3.3s^{2}\\,+\\,3.6s\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nfrom which we get  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,0,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-1.65\\,+\\,j0.9367,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-1.65\\,-\\,j0.9367\n$$  \n\nPoint $s=0$ corresponds to the actual breakaway point. But points $s\\,=\\,1.65\\,\\pm\\,j0.9367$ are neither breakaway nor break-in points, because the corresponding gain values $K$ become complex quantities.  \n\nTo check the points where root-locus branches may cross the imaginary axis, substitute $s=j\\omega$ into the characteristic equation, yielding.  \n\n$$\n(j\\omega)^{3}\\,+\\,3.6(j\\omega)^{2}\\,+\\,K j\\omega\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\big(K\\,-\\,3.6\\omega^{2}\\big)\\,+\\,j\\omega\\big(K\\,-\\,\\omega^{2}\\big)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nNotice that this equation can be satisfied only if $\\omega=0,K=0.$ .Because of the presence of a double pole at the origin, the root locus is tangent to the $j\\omega$ axis at $\\omega\\,=\\,0,$ The root-locus branches do not cross the $j\\omega$ axis. Figure 6–65(b) is a sketch of the root loci for this system.  \n\nA–6–3. Sketch the root loci for the system shown in Figure 6–66(a).  \n\nSolution. A root locus exists on the real axis between point $s=-0.4$ and $s=-3.6.$ The angles of asymptotes can be found as follows:  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{Angles~of~asymptotes}}={\\frac{\\pm180^{\\circ}(2k+1)}{3-1}}=90^{\\circ},-90^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe intersection of the asymptotes and the real axis is obtained from  \n\n$$\ns\\,=-\\,\\frac{0\\,+\\,0\\,+\\,3.6\\,-\\,0.4}{3\\,-\\,1}=-1.6\n$$  \n\nNext we shall find the breakaway points.

A block labeled \"K(s+0.4)/(s+3.6)\" represents the transfer function, while another block features a \"+\" sign. The image includes several lines with arrows pointing in different directions, likely representing signals flowing through the system. This section appears to be a diagrammatic representation of a control system's architecture and signal flow.\n\n**Section (b)** is a graph displaying a waveform that oscillates between positive and negative values on both the x-axis and y-axis. The waveform exhibits symmetry about the origin, suggesting it represents an even function. Notably, the waveform reaches its maximum value at approximately 1 unit on the y-axis, indicating a magnitude of 1. Additionally, the graph includes labels for the y-axis and x-axis, which are denoted as \"jo\" and \"σ,\" respectively. These labels suggest that the graph is plotting a complex function, with the real part (σ) plotted against the imaginary part (jo). This section provides a visual representation of mathematical concepts related to waveforms and functions.\n\nIn summary, the image presents two distinct sections, each illustrating different aspects of mathematical concepts. Section (a) depicts a control system's architecture and signal flow, while Section (b) displays a waveform that oscillates between positive and negative values on both axes. The inclusion of labels and notation provides context for understanding the underlying mathematical principles represented in the image. 6–66 (a) Control system; (b) root-locus plot.  \n\nThe breakaway and break-in points are found from  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d K}{d s}}=-\\,{\\frac{\\left(3s^{2}\\,+\\,7.2s\\right)\\!(s\\,+\\,0.4)\\,-\\,\\left(s^{3}\\,+\\,3.6s^{2}\\right)}{(s\\,+\\,0.4)^{2}}}=0\n$$  \n\nfrom which we get  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,2.4s^{2}\\,+\\,1.44s\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ns(s\\,+\\,1.2)^{2}=0\n$$  \n\nThus, the breakaway or break-in points are at $s=0$ and $s=-1.2$ .Note that A B$s=-1.2$ is a double root.When a double root occurs in ${d K}/{d s}=0$ at point $s\\,=-1.2,d^{2}K/(d s^{2})\\,=\\,0$ at this point.The value of gain $K$ at point $s=-1.2$ is  \n\n$$\nK=-\\left.\\frac{s^{3}\\,+\\,3.6s^{2}}{s\\,+\\,4}\\,\\right|_{s=-1.2}=4.32\n$$  \n\nThis means that with $K=4.32$ the characteristic equation has a triple root at point $s=-1.2.$ .This can be easily verified as follows:  \n\n$$\ns^{3}+3.6s^{2}+4.32s+1.728=(s\\,+\\,1.2)^{3}=0\n$$  \n\nHence, three root-locus branches meet at point $s=-1.2$ .The angles of departures at point $s=-1.2$ of the root locus branches that approach the asymptotes are $\\pm180^{\\circ}/3$ that is, $60^{\\circ}$ and $-60^{\\circ}$ . (See Problem A–6–4 .)  \n\nFinally,we shall examine if root-locus branches cross the imaginary axis.By substituting $s=j\\omega$ into the characteristic equation, we have  \n\n$$\n(j\\omega)^{3}\\,+\\,3.6(j\\omega)^{2}\\,+\\,K(j\\omega)\\,+\\,0.4K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\big(0.4K\\,-\\,3.6\\omega^{2}\\big)\\,+\\,j\\omega\\big(K\\,-\\,\\omega^{2}\\big)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThis equation can be satisfied only if $\\omega\\,=\\,0,K\\,=\\,0.$ At point $\\omega=0$ ,the root locus is tangent to the jvaxis because of the presence of a double pole at the origin.There are no points where rootlocus branches cross the imaginary axis.  \n\nA sketch of the root loci for this system is shown in Figure 6–66(b).  \n\nA–6–4.

Even though the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles is 0.5, the amount of overshoot is very much higher than expected.A closer look at the root-locus plot reveals that the presence of the zero at $s=-1$ is increasing the amount of the maximum overshoot. [In general, if a closed-loop zero or zeros (compensator zero or zeros) lie to the right of the dominant pair of the complex poles, then the dominant poles are no longer dominant.] If large maximum overshoot cannot be tolerated, the compensator zero(s) should be shifted sufficiently to the left.  \n\nIn the current design, it is desirable to modify the compensator and make the maximum overshoot smaller.

Consider the system shown in Figure 6–90. Design a lag–lead compensator such that the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is $50~\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$ of the dominant closedloop poles is 0.5. (Choose the zero of the lead portion of the lag–lead compensator to cancel the pole at $s=-1$ of the plant.)

The main points are:\n\n• **Transfer Function**\n\t+ A box labeled \"Gc(s)\" represents the transfer function.\n\t+ An arrow pointing to the right indicates that this is an output.\n\t+ The equation inside the box is 1 / (s + 5), which suggests that the system has a single pole at -5.\n\n• **Controller**\n\t+ A circle with a cross inside it, often referred to as a \"lead\" or \"differentiator\", represents the controller.\n\t+ An arrow pointing to the left indicates that this is an input.\n\t+ The equation inside the circle is s + 1, which suggests that the controller introduces a zero at -1 and a pole at infinity.\n\n• **Overall System**\n\t+ The transfer function Gc(s) is multiplied by the controller, resulting in a new transfer function.\n\t+ The overall system can be represented as G(s) = (s + 1) / (s^2 + 6s + 5), where s represents the Laplace variable.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a simple control system consisting of a transfer function and a controller. The transfer function has a single pole at -5, while the controller introduces a zero at -1 and a pole at infinity. The overall system has a more complex dynamics due to the multiplication of the two components.  \n\nSolution.

The plot provides valuable insights into the behavior of the system's poles and their relationship with the compensator gain. By examining the various features of the plot, such as the closed-loop poles, asymptotes, and centroid, one can gain a deeper understanding of the system's dynamics and optimize its performance accordingly.  \nRoot-Locus Plot of Compensated System near the Origin  \n\nThe image depicts a graph featuring the complex plane, specifically focusing on the real and imaginary axes. This representation is crucial for understanding complex numbers, which combine both real and imaginary parts.\n\n**Key Elements:**\n\n*   **Axes:** The x-axis represents the real part (Re), while the y-axis denotes the imaginary part (Im). These axes are fundamental in plotting complex numbers.\n*   **Origin:** Located at the center of the graph, the origin serves as a reference point for both real and imaginary parts, marked by \"0\".\n*   **Graphical Representation:** Complex numbers can be visualized on this plane. For example, the number 3 + 4i is represented by a point three units to the right of the origin on the x-axis (real part) and four units up from the origin along the y-axis (imaginary part).\n*   **Circle:** A circle centered at the origin is also visible in the graph. This circle has a radius of one unit, indicating that it represents all possible complex numbers with an absolute value (magnitude) less than or equal to one.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe graph provides a visual tool for understanding and manipulating complex numbers. It helps in recognizing patterns and relationships between different complex numbers. The inclusion of the circle highlights the concept of magnitude in the context of complex numbers, which is essential for various mathematical operations and analyses involving these quantities.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a graphical representation of the complex plane, emphasizing its significance in understanding and working with complex numbers. 6–91 (a) Root-locus plot of compensated system; (b) rootlocus plot near the origin.  \n\nFigures 6–92(a) and (b) show the unit-step response and unit-ramp response of the designed system, respectively. Note that the closed-loop pole at $s\\,=\\,-0.1684$ almost cancels the zero at $s\\,=\\,-0.16025$ .However, this pair of closed-loop pole and zero located near the origin produces a long tail of small amplitude. Since the closed-loop pole at $s\\,=\\,-17.205$ is located very much farther to the left compared to the closed-loop poles at $s\\,=-1.8308\\,\\pm\\,j3.2359$ the effect of this real pole on the system response is very small. Therefore, the closed-loop poles at $s\\,=-1.8308\\,\\pm\\,j3.2359$ are indeed dominant closed-loop poles that determine the response characteristics of the closed-loop system. In the unit-ramp response, the steady-state error in following the unit-ramp input eventually becomes $1/K_{v}\\stackrel{\\star}{=}\\frac{1}{50}\\stackrel{\\star}{=}0.02$  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a single function, which is represented by a solid black line. The graph's axes are labeled as follows:\n\n*   **Y-axis (Output):** 0 to 1.4\n*   **X-axis (t Sec):** 0 to 14\n\nThe graph features several key points and trends:\n\n*   The function starts at approximately (0, 0) and rises rapidly.\n*   It reaches a peak around (2, 1.3) before decreasing slightly.\n*   From t = 4 to t = 6, the function remains relatively stable, with minimal variation.\n*   Afterward, it begins to decrease more gradually until reaching approximately (14, 1).\n\nOverall, the graph illustrates a single function that exhibits an initial rapid increase, followed by a period of stability and then a gradual decline.  \nUnit-Ramp Response of Compensated System  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a title that reads \"Unit-Ramp Response of Compensated System\". The graph is set against a white background and features black text.\n\nHere are the key elements of the graph:\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   The title, \"Unit-Ramp Response of Compensated System\", is displayed in bold font at the top of the image.\n    *   It provides context for the data being presented in the graph.\n*   **X-axis (Horizontal Axis)**\n    *   The x-axis represents time, with values ranging from 0 to 10 seconds.\n    *   The axis is labeled \"t Sec\" and features tick marks at intervals of 1 second.\n*   **Y-axis (Vertical Axis)**\n    *   The y-axis represents output, with values ranging from 0 to 10 units.\n    *   The axis is labeled \"Output\" and features tick marks at intervals of 1 unit.\n*   **Line Graph**\n    *   A single black line runs through the graph, starting at (0, 0) and ending at (10, 9.8).\n    *   The line exhibits a gentle upward slope, indicating a gradual increase in output over time.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a line graph showing the unit-ramp response of a compensated system over a period of 10 seconds. The graph reveals a steady increase in output from 0 to approximately 9.8 units during this time frame. 6–92 (a) Unit-step response of the compensated system; (b) unit-ramp response of the compensated system.  \n\nA–6–18.

The response shows highfrequency oscillations at the beginning of the response due to the poles at $s\\,=\\,-0.0417\\,\\pm\\,j2.4489$ The response is dominated by the pole at $s\\,=\\,-0.0167.$ .The settling time is approximately 240 sec.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, specifically an aircraft's autopilot system. The diagram shows the flow of signals and components involved in controlling the aircraft's altitude.\n\n**Components:**\n\n*   **Hydraulic Servo:** This component is responsible for converting electrical signals into hydraulic pressure to actuate the elevator or rudder.\n*   **Aircraft:** The aircraft itself, which responds to the control inputs from the servo.\n*   **Rate Gyro:** This component measures the angular rate of rotation about a specific axis (pitch, roll, or yaw).\n*   **Control System:** A system that continuously monitors and adjusts the aircraft's altitude based on feedback from sensors.\n\n**Signal Flow:**\n\n*   The input to the control system is the desired altitude setpoint (R(s)).\n*   The output of the control system is the actual altitude (C(s)), which is compared to the setpoint using a subtractor block.\n*   The error signal from the subtractor block drives the hydraulic servo, which adjusts the elevator or rudder accordingly.\n*   The rate gyro measures the angular rate of rotation and feeds it back into the control system.\n\n**Mathematical Representation:**\n\nThe diagram can be mathematically represented as follows:\n\nR(s) - C(s) = G(s)\n\nwhere R(s) is the desired altitude setpoint, C(s) is the actual altitude, and G(s) is the transfer function of the control system.\n\nIn this case, the transfer function of the hydraulic servo and aircraft dynamics can be modeled using a first-order transfer function:\n\nG(s) = 1 / (s + 1)\n\nThis means that the system has a single pole at s = -1, indicating a single time constant. The rate gyro's output is added to the error signal to provide feedback compensation.\n\nOverall, the block diagram illustrates a simple yet effective control strategy for maintaining stable altitude in an aircraft. By continuously monitoring and adjusting the elevator or rudder based on feedback from sensors, the system can maintain precise control over the aircraft's altitude.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with the title \"Unit-Step Response of Uncompensated System\" at the top, set against a white background.

The graph's axes are labeled, and it features a single line that exhibits exponential growth over time, reaching its maximum value at approximately 1. 6–93 (a) Attitude-rate control system; (b) unit-step response.  \n\nIt is desired to speed up the response and also eliminate the oscillatory mode at the beginning of the response.

This suggests that the value 'a' and the signal 's' are being combined or processed within this initial block.\n\nMoving to the right, we encounter the second block, denoted as \"(2/s^2) (s+2)\". This indicates a transformation involving multiplication by a factor related to both the input signal 's' and a constant term '2', followed by an exponentiation operation. It is important to note that without explicit information about the nature of these operations or their mathematical context, we can only infer that this block represents a complex signal processing step.\n\nFinally, at the far right of the diagram, there exists another block with no visible label or content.

In frequency-response methods, we vary the frequency of the input signal over a certain range and study the resulting response.  \n\nIn this chapter we present frequency-response approaches to the analysis and design of control systems.The information we get from such analysis is different from what we get from root-locus analysis. In fact, the frequency response and root-locus approaches complement each other. One advantage of the frequency-response approach is that we can use the data obtained from measurements on the physical system without deriving its mathematical model. In many practical designs of control systems both approaches are employed. Control engineers must be familiar with both.  \n\nFrequency-response methods were developed in 1930s and 1940s by Nyquist, Bode, Nichols, and many others. The frequency-response methods are most powerful in conventional control theory.They are also indispensable to robust control theory.  \n\nThe Nyquist stability criterion enables us to investigate both the absolute and relative stabilities of linear closed-loop systems from a knowledge of their open-loop frequencyresponse characteristics. An advantage of the frequency-response approach is that frequency-response tests are, in general, simple and can be made accurately by use of readily available sinusoidal signal generators and precise measurement equipment.Often the transfer functions of complicated components can be determined experimentally by frequency-response tests. In addition, the frequency-response approach has the advantages that a system may be designed so that the effects of undesirable noise are negligible and that such analysis and design can be extended to certain nonlinear control systems.  \n\nAlthough the frequency response of a control system presents a qualitative picture of the transient response,the correlation between frequency and transient responses is indirect,except for the case of second-order systems. In designing a closed-loop system, we adjust the frequency-response characteristic of the open-loop transfer function by using several design criteria in order to obtain acceptable transient-response characteristics for the system.  \n\nObtaining Steady-State Outputs to Sinusoidal Inputs. We shall show that the steady-state output of a transfer function system can be obtained directly from the sinusoidal transfer function—that is, the transfer function in which $s$ is replaced by $j\\omega$ ,where $\\omega$ is frequency.  \n\nConsider the stable,linear,time-invariant system shown in Figure 7–1.The input and output of the system,whose transfer function is $G(s)$ ,are denoted by $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ ,respectively. If the input $x(t)$ is a sinusoidal signal, the steady-state output will also be a sinusoidal signal of the same frequency, but with possibly different magnitude and phase angle.  \n\nLet us assume that the input signal to the system is given by  \n\n$$\nx(t)\\,=\\,X\\sin\\omega t\n$$  \n\n[In this book “ $\\mathbf{\\omega}^{\\bullet}\\omega^{\\bullet}$ is always measured in rad/sec. When the frequency is measured in cycle/sec, we use notation $\\mathbf{\\nabla}^{\\ast}\\!f^{\\ast}$ ”.That is, $\\omega=2\\pi f$ .]  \n\nSuppose that the transfer function $G(s)$ of the system can be written as a ratio of two polynomials in $s$ ; that is,  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,={\\frac{p(s)}{q(s)}}={\\frac{p(s)}{(s\\,+\\,s_{1})(s\\,+\\,s_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,s_{n})}}\n$$  \n\nThe Laplace-transformed output $Y(s)$ of the system is then  \n\n$$\nY(s)=G(s)X(s)={\\frac{p(s)}{q(s)}}\\,X(s)\n$$  \n\nwhere $X(s)$ is the Laplace transform of the input $x(t)$ .  \n\nIt will be shown that, after waiting until steady-state conditions are reached, the frequency response can be calculated by replacing $s$ in the transfer function by $j\\omega$ . It will also be shown that the steady-state response can be given by  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,M e^{j\\phi}\\,=\\,M\\,\\bigl/\\phi\n$$  \n\nwhere $M$ is the amplitude ratio of the output and input sinusoids and $\\phi$ is the phase shift between the input sinusoid and the output sinusoid. In the frequency-response test, the input frequency $\\omega$ is varied until the entire frequency range of interest is covered.  \n\nThe steady-state response of a stable, linear, time-invariant system to a sinusoidal input does not depend on the initial conditions. (Thus, we can assume the zero initial condition.) If $Y(s)$ has only distinct poles, then the partial fraction expansion of Equation (7–1) when $x(t)=X$ sin vtyields  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{Y(s)=G(s)X(s)\\,=\\,G(s)\\,{\\frac{\\omega X}{s^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}}}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\cfrac{a}{s\\,+\\,j\\omega}}+{\\cfrac{a}{s\\,-\\,j\\omega}}+{\\cfrac{b_{1}}{s\\,+\\,s_{1}}}+{\\cfrac{b_{2}}{s\\,+\\,s_{2}}}+\\cdots+{\\cfrac{b_{n}}{s\\,+\\,s_{n}}}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–1 Stable, linear, timeinvariant system.  \n\nwhere $a$ and the $b_{i}$ (where $i=1,2,\\dots,n)$ )are constants and $\\bar{a}$ –is the complex conjugate of $a$ .The inverse Laplace transform of Equation (7–2) gives  \n\n$$\ny(t)=a e^{-j\\omega t}+\\bar{a}e^{j\\omega t}+b_{1}e^{-s_{1}t}+b_{2}e^{-s_{2}t}+\\cdots+b_{n}e^{-s_{n}t}\\qquad(t\\geq0)\n$$  \n\nFor a stable system, $-s_{1},-s_{2},\\ldots,-s_{n}$ have negative real parts.Therefore, as $t$ approaches infinity, the terms $e^{-s_{1}t}$ ,$e^{-s_{2}t},\\ldots$ ,and $e^{-s_{n}t}$ approach zero.Thus, all the terms on the righthand side of Equation (7–3), except the first two, drop out at steady state.  \n\nIf $Y(s)$ involves multiple poles $s_{j}$ of multiplicity $m_{j}$ ,then $y(t)$ will involve terms such as $t^{h_{j}}e^{-s_{j}t}\\bigl(h_{j}=0,1,2,\\ldots,m_{j}-1\\bigr)$ .For a stable system, the terms $t^{h_{j}}e^{-s_{j}t}$ approach zero as $t$ approaches infinity.  \n\nThus, regardless of whether the system is of the distinct-pole type or multiple-pole type, the steady-state response becomes  \n\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)\\,=\\,a e^{-j\\omega t}\\,+\\,\\bar{a}e^{j\\omega t}\n$$  \n\nwhere the constant $a$ can be evaluated from Equation (7–2) as follows:  \n\n$$\na\\,=\\,G(s)\\,\\frac{\\omega X}{s^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}}\\left(s\\,+\\,j\\omega\\right)\\bigg|_{s=-j\\omega}=-\\,\\frac{X G(-j\\omega)}{2j}\n$$  \n\nNote that  \n\n$$\n{\\bar{a}}=G(s)\\,{\\frac{\\omega X}{s^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}}}\\left(s\\,-\\,j\\omega\\right)\\left|_{s=j\\omega}={\\frac{X G(j\\omega)}{2j}}\n$$  \n\nSince $G(j\\omega)$ is a complex quantity, it can be written in the following form:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|e^{j\\phi}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ represents the magnitude and $\\phi$ represents the angle of $G(j\\omega)$ ; that is,  \n\n$$\n\\phi\\,=\\,\\underbrace{\\big/G(j\\omega)}_{\\mathrm{Teal}\\;\\mathrm{part}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;G(j\\omega)}\\_\n$$  \n\nThe angle $\\phi$ may be negative, positive, or zero. Similarly, we obtain the following expression for $G(-j\\omega)$ :  \n\n$$\nG(-j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\left|G(-j\\omega)\\right|e^{-j\\phi}\\,=\\,\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|e^{-j\\phi}\n$$  \n\nThen, noting that  \n\n$$\na={\\it\\Delta}-\\frac{X|G(j\\omega)|e^{-j\\phi}}{2j},~~~~~\\bar{a}=\\frac{X|G(j\\omega)|e^{j\\phi}}{2j}\n$$  \n\nEquation (7–4) can be written  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\lefteqn{y_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)\\,=\\,X\\bigl|G(j\\omega)\\bigr|\\,\\frac{e^{j(\\omega t+\\phi)}\\,-\\,e^{-j(\\omega t+\\phi)}}{2j}}}\\\\ &{=\\,X\\bigl|G(j\\omega)\\bigr|\\,\\sin{(\\omega t\\,+\\,\\phi)}}\\\\ &{=\\,Y\\sin{(\\omega t\\,+\\,\\phi)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a graph of two waves, with the top wave labeled \"X\" and the bottom wave labeled \"Y\". The waves are sinusoidal in shape, with the X wave having a slightly higher amplitude than the Y wave. Both waves have an identical wavelength.\n\n*   **Waves**\n    *   Two waves are present in the image.\n    *   One wave is labeled as \"X\" and the other as \"Y\".\n    *   The waves have sinusoidal shapes.\n*   **Amplitude**\n    *   The X wave has a slightly higher amplitude than the Y wave.\n    *   Both waves have identical amplitudes.\n*   **Wavelength**\n    *   Both waves have an identical wavelength.\n\nIn summary, the image shows two waves with sinusoidal shapes, having different amplitudes but identical wavelengths. 7–2 Input and output sinusoidal signals.   \nOutput y(t)=Ysin ( vt+f)  \n\nwhere $Y\\,=\\,{\\cal X}\\big|G(j\\omega)\\big|$ .We see that a stable, linear, time-invariant system subjected to a   \nsinusoidal input will, at steady state, have a sinusoidal output of the same frequency as   \nthe input. But the amplitude and phase of the output will, in general, be different from   \nthose of the input. In fact, the amplitude of the output is given by the product of that of $\\left|\\bar{G}(j\\omega)\\right|$ , while the phase angle differs from that of the input by the amount   \n$\\phi\\,=\\,\\bigl/G\\bigl(j\\omega\\bigr).$ ). An example of input and output sinusoidal signals is shown in Figure 7–2. On the basis of this, we obtain this important result: For sinusoidal inputs,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{\\displaystyle{\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|=\\left|\\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)}\\right|=\\operatorname*{amplitude}_{\\mathrm{input}~s i n u s o i d}\\mathrm{of~the~output~sinuisoid~to~the~}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\left|G(j\\omega)=\\left|\\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)}=\\operatorname*{phase}_{\\mathrm{the~input}~s i n u s o i d}\\right|\\mathrm{ne~output~sinusoid~with~respect~}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence, the steady-state response characteristics of a system to a sinusoidal input can be obtained directly from  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(j\\omega)}{X(j\\omega)}=G(j\\omega)\n$$  \n\nThe function $G(j\\omega)$ is called the sinusoidal transfer function. It is the ratio of $Y(j\\omega)$ to $X(j\\omega)$ ,is a complex quantity, and can be represented by the magnitude and phase angle with frequency as a parameter.The sinusoidal transfer function of any linear system is obtained by substituting $j\\omega$ for $s$ in the transfer function of the system.  \n\nAs already mentioned in Chapter 6,a positive phase angle is called phase lead,and a negative phase angle is called phase lag.A network that has phase-lead characteristics is called a lead network, while a network that has phase-lag characteristics is called a lag network.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–1  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 7–3.The transfer function $G(s)$ is  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{K}{T s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nFor the sinusoidal input $x(t)\\,=\\,X\\sin\\omega t$ , the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)$ can be found as follows: Substituting $j\\omega$ for $s$ in $G(s)$ yields  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{K}{j T\\omega\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–3 First-order system.  \n\n$$\n\\xrightarrow{x}\\cdots\\Biggl[\\frac{X}{T s+1}\\xrightarrow{y}\n$$  \n\nThe amplitude ratio of the output to the input is  \n\n$$\n\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|=\\frac{K}{\\sqrt{1+T^{2}\\omega^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nwhile the phase angle $\\phi$ is  \n\n$$\n\\phi\\,=\\,\\left/G(j\\omega)\\right.=-\\tan^{-1}T\\omega\n$$  \n\nThus, for the input $x(t)\\,=\\,X\\sin\\omega t$ , the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)$ can be obtained from Equation (7–5) as follows:  \n\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)=\\frac{X K}{\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,T^{2}\\omega^{2}}}\\sin\\!\\left(\\omega t\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}T\\omega\\right)\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation (7–6), it can be seen that for small $\\omega$ , the amplitude of the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)$ is almost equal to $K$ times the amplitude of the input.The phase shift of the output is small for small $\\omega$ . For large $\\omega$ , the amplitude of the output is small and almost inversely proportional to $\\omega$ .The phase shift approaches $-90^{\\circ}$ as $\\omega$ approaches infinity.This is a phase-lag network.  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–2 Consider the network given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}\n$$  \n\nDetermine whether this network is a lead network or lag network.  \n\nFor the sinusoidal input $x(t)\\,=\\,X\\sin\\omega t$ , the steady-state output $y_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)$ can be found as follows: Since  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{j\\omega+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}{j\\omega+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}=\\frac{T_{2}(1+T_{1}j\\omega)}{T_{1}\\big(1+T_{2}j\\omega\\big)}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n\\bigl|G(j\\omega)\\bigr|\\,=\\frac{T_{2}\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,T_{1}^{2}\\omega^{2}}}{T_{1}\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,T_{2}^{2}\\omega^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\phi\\,=\\,\\left/G(j\\omega)\\right.=\\,\\tan^{-1}T_{1}\\omega\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}T_{2}\\omega\n$$  \n\nThus the steady-state output is  \n\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}}(t)\\,=\\frac{X T_{2}\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,T_{1}^{2}\\omega^{2}}}{T_{1}\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,T_{2}^{2}\\omega^{2}}}\\,\\mathrm{sin}(\\omega t\\,+\\,\\tan^{-1}T_{1}\\omega\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}T_{2}\\omega)\n$$  \n\nFrom this expression, we find that if $T_{1}>T_{2}$ ,then $\\tan^{-1}T_{1}\\omega\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}T_{2}\\omega>0.$ .Thus, if $T_{1}>T_{2}$ ,then the network is a lead network. If $T_{1}<T_{2}$ ,then the network is a lag network.  \n\nPresenting Frequency-Response Characteristics in Graphical Forms. The sinusoidal transfer function, a complex function of the frequency $\\omega$ , is characterized by its magnitude and phase angle, with frequency as the parameter. There are three commonly used representations of sinusoidal transfer functions:  \n\n1. Bode diagram or logarithmic plot   \n2. Nyquist plot or polar plot   \n3. Log-magnitude-versus-phase plot (Nichols plots)  \n\nWe shall discuss these representations in detail in this chapter. We shall include the MATLAB approach to obtain Bode diagrams, Nyquist plots, and Nichols plots.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. Section 7–1 has presented introductory material on the frequency response. Section 7–2 presents Bode diagrams of various transfer-function systems. Section 7–3 treats polar plots of transfer functions. Section 7–4 discusses log-magnitude-versus-phase plots. Section 7–5 gives a detailed account of the Nyquist stability criterion. Section 7–6 discusses the stability analysis based on the Nyquist stability criterion. Section 7–7 introduces measures of relative stability analysis. Section 7–8 presents a method for obtaining the closed-loop frequency response from the open-loop frequency response by use of the M and N circles. The Nichols chart is introduced here. Section 7–9 treats experimental determination of transfer functions. Section 7–10 presents introductory aspects of control systems design by the frequency-response approach. Sections 7–11, 7–12, and 7–13 give detailed accounts of lead compensation, lag compensation, and lag–lead compensation techniques, respectively.  \n\n# 7–2 BODE DIAGRAMS  \n\nBode Diagrams or Logarithmic Plots. A Bode diagram consists of two graphs: One is a plot of the logarithm of the magnitude of a sinusoidal transfer function; the other is a plot of the phase angle; both are plotted against the frequency on a logarithmic scale.  \n\nThe standard representation of the logarithmic magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ is $20\\log\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ ,where the base of the logarithm is 10.The unit used in this representation of the magnitude is the decibel, usually abbreviated dB. In the logarithmic representation, the curves are drawn on semilog paper, using the log scale for frequency and the linear scale for either magnitude (but in decibels) or phase angle (in degrees). (The frequency range of interest determines the number of logarithmic cycles required on the abscissa.)  \n\nThe main advantage of using the Bode diagram is that multiplication of magnitudes can be converted into addition. Furthermore, a simple method for sketching an approximate log-magnitude curve is available. It is based on asymptotic approximations. Such approximation by straight-line asymptotes is sufficient if only rough information on the frequency-response characteristics is needed. Should the exact curve be desired, corrections can be made easily to these basic asymptotic plots. Expanding the low-frequency range by use of a logarithmic scale for the frequency is highly advantageous, since characteristics at low frequencies are most important in practical systems. Although it is not possible to plot the curves right down to zero frequency because of the logarithmic frequency $\\operatorname{log}0\\,=\\,-\\infty)$ ), this does not create a serious problem.  \n\nNote that the experimental determination of a transfer function can be made simple if frequency-response data are presented in the form of a Bode diagram.  \n\nBasic Factors of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ .As stated earlier, the main advantage in using the logarithmic plot is the relative ease of plotting frequency-response curves. The basic factors that very frequently occur in an arbitrary transfer function $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ are  \n\n1. Gain $K$  \n\n2. Integral and derivative factors $\\left(j\\omega\\right)^{\\mp1}$   \n3. First-order factors $(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)^{\\mp1}$ D  \n4. Quadratic factors $\\left[1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\bigl(j\\omega/\\omega_{n}\\bigr)\\,+\\,\\bigl(j\\omega/\\omega_{n}\\bigr)^{2}\\right]^{\\mp1}$  \n\nOnce we become familiar with the logarithmic plots of these basic factors, it is possible to utilize them in constructing a composite logarithmic plot for any general form of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ by sketching the curves for each factor and adding individual curves graphically, because adding the logarithms of the gains corresponds to multiplying them together.  \n\nThe Gain K. A number greater than unity has a positive value in decibels, while a number smaller than unity has a negative value.The log-magnitude curve for a constant gain $K$ is a horizontal straight line at the magnitude of $20\\log K$ decibels.The phase angle of the gain $K$ is zero. The effect of varying the gain $K$ in the transfer function is that it raises or lowers the log-magnitude curve of the transfer function by the corresponding constant amount, but it has no effect on the phase curve.  \n\nA number–decibel conversion line is given in Figure 7–4. The decibel value of any number can be obtained from this line. As a number increases by a factor of 10, the corresponding decibel value increases by a factor of 20. This may be seen from the following:  \n\n$$\n20\\log(K\\times10)=20\\log K\\,+\\,20\n$$  \n\nSimilarly,  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\bigl(K\\,\\times\\,10^{n}\\bigr)\\,=\\,20\\log K\\,+\\,20n\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, featuring a grid pattern. The vertical axis is labeled \"Decibels (dB)\" and extends from -40 to 20 decibels, while the horizontal axis is labeled \"Numbers\" and ranges from 0.01 to 10.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The graph displays a diagonal line that runs from the bottom left corner to the top right corner.\n*   The line passes through several points on both axes, indicating a direct relationship between decibels and numbers.\n*   There are no other notable features or markings on the graph.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe graph appears to be a simple representation of a mathematical concept or relationship. Without additional context or information about the data being represented, it is difficult to provide further interpretation or analysis. 7–4 Number–decibel conversion line.  \n\nNote that, when expressed in decibels, the reciprocal of a number differs from its value only in sign; that is, for the number $K$ ,  \n\n$$\n20\\log K=-20\\log{\\frac{1}{K}}\n$$  \n\nIntegral and Derivative Factors $(j\\omega)^{\\mp1}$ .The logarithmic magnitude of $1/j\\omega$ in decibels is  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|\\frac{1}{j\\omega}\\right|\\,=-20\\log\\omega\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThe phase angle of $1/j\\omega$ is constant and equal to $-90^{\\circ}$ .  \n\nIn Bode diagrams, frequency ratios are expressed in terms of octaves or decades.An octave is a frequency band from $\\omega_{1}$ to $2\\omega_{1}$ , where $\\omega_{1}$ is any frequency value.A decade is a frequency band from $\\omega_{1}$ to $10\\omega_{1}$ , where again $\\omega_{1}$ is any frequency. (On the logarithmic scale of semilog paper, any given frequency ratio can be represented by the same horizontal distance. For example, the horizontal distance from $\\omega=1$ to $\\omega\\,=\\,10$ is equal to that from $\\omega=3$ to $\\omega\\,=\\,30.$ .)  \n\nIf the log magnitude $-20\\log\\omega$ dB is plotted against $\\omega$ on a logarithmic scale, it is a straight line.To draw this straight line,we need to locate one point $(0\\,\\mathrm{dB},\\omega=1)$ )on it.Since  \n\n$$\n(-20\\log10\\omega)\\;\\mathrm{dB}\\,=\\,(-20\\log\\omega\\,-\\,20)\\;\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nthe slope of the line is $-20$ dB 'decade (or $^{-6}$ dB 'octave). Similarly, the log magnitude of $j\\omega$ in decibels is  \n\n$$\n20\\log|j\\omega|\\,=\\,20\\log\\omega\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThe phase angle of $j\\omega$ is constant and equal to $90^{\\circ}$ .The log-magnitude curve is a straight line with a slope of $20\\ \\mathrm{dB}$ 'decade. Figures 7–5(a) and (b) show frequency-response curves for $1/j\\omega$ and $j\\omega$ , respectively. We can clearly see that the differences in the frequency responses of the factors $1/j\\omega$ and $j\\omega$ lie in the signs of the slopes of the logmagnitude curves and in the signs of the phase angles. Both log magnitudes become equal to $\\mathrm{0~dB}$ at $\\omega=1$ .  \n\nIf the transfer function contains the factor $(1/j\\omega)^{n}$ or $(j\\omega)^{n}$ , the log magnitude becomes, respectively,  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|{\\frac{1}{(j\\omega)^{n}}}\\right|=-n\\,\\times\\,20\\log|j\\omega|\\,=\\,-20n\\log\\omega\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|(j\\omega)^{n}\\right|\\,=\\,n\\,\\times\\,20\\log|j\\omega|\\,=\\,20n\\log\\omega\\;\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThe slopes of the log-magnitude curves for the factors $(1/j\\omega)^{n}$ and ${\\left(j\\omega\\right)}^{n}$ are thus $-20n$ dB 'decade and $20n$ dB 'decade, respectively.The phase angle of $(1/j\\omega)^{n}$ is equal to $-90^{\\circ}\\times n$ over the entire frequency range, while that of $(j\\omega)^{n}$ is equal to $90^{\\circ}\\times n$ over the entire frequency range. The magnitude curves will pass through the point $\\mathrm{~0~dB},\\omega=1)$ .  \n\nThe image presents a comparison of two Bode diagrams, labeled as (a) and (b), which illustrate the frequency response characteristics of two different systems. The diagrams are displayed side-by-side, allowing for a direct visual comparison of their respective features.\n\n**Diagram (a)**:\n\n*   **Frequency Response**: The diagram shows a downward-sloping line that intersects the x-axis at approximately 100 Hz, indicating a cutoff frequency.\n*   **Magnitude Plot**: The magnitude plot is depicted as an inverted right triangle, with its apex at 0 dB and its base on the negative side of the y-axis. This represents a low-pass filter characteristic, where the amplitude decreases as the frequency increases beyond the cutoff point.\n*   **Phase Response**: The phase response is shown as a horizontal line at 0°, indicating no phase shift across all frequencies.\n\n**Diagram (b)**:\n\n*   **Frequency Response**: Similar to Diagram (a), this diagram also features an upward-sloping line that intersects the x-axis at approximately 100 Hz, again representing a cutoff frequency.\n*   **Magnitude Plot**: The magnitude plot is depicted as a right triangle, with its apex at 0 dB and its base on the positive side of the y-axis. This represents a high-pass filter characteristic, where the amplitude increases as the frequency increases beyond the cutoff point.\n*   **Phase Response**: The phase response is shown as a horizontal line at 90°, indicating a constant phase shift across all frequencies.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**:\n\nBy comparing the two diagrams, it becomes evident that they represent complementary systems. Diagram (a) corresponds to a low-pass filter, while Diagram (b) represents a high-pass filter. The magnitude plots and frequency responses demonstrate these characteristics, with the phase responses indicating no phase shift for the low-pass filter and a constant 90° phase shift for the high-pass filter.\n\nIn summary, the image effectively illustrates the frequency response characteristics of two distinct systems using Bode diagrams, providing a clear visual representation of their respective magnitudes and phases. 7–5 (a) Bode diagram of $G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,1/j\\omega;$ ;(b) Bode diagram of $G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,j\\omega$ .  \n\nFirst-Order Factors $(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)^{\\mp1}$ .The log magnitude of the first-order factor $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ is  \n\n$$\n20\\,\\mathrm{log}\\left|\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}\\right|\\,=\\,-20\\,\\mathrm{log}\\,\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nFor low frequencies, such that $\\omega\\ll1/T$ , the log magnitude may be approximated by  \n\n$$\n-20\\log\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}\\doteq-20\\log1\\,=\\,0\\:\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThus, the log-magnitude curve at low frequencies is the constant 0-dB line. For high frequencies, such that $\\omega\\gg1/T$ ,  \n\n$$\n-20\\log{\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}}\\doteq-20\\log\\omega T\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThis is an approximate expression for the high-frequency range. At $\\omega=1/T$ , the log magnitude equals 0 dB; at $\\omega\\,=\\,10/T$ , the log magnitude is $-20$ dB. Thus, the value of $-20\\log\\omega T$ dB decreases by $20\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ for every decade of $\\omega.\\operatorname{For}\\omega\\gg1/T$ ,the log-magnitude curve is thus a straight line with a slope of $-20\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ /decade (or $^{-6}$ dB /octave).  \n\nOur analysis shows that the logarithmic representation of the frequency-response curve of the factor $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ can be approximated by two straight-line asymptotes, one a straight line at 0 dB for the frequency range $0<\\omega<1/T$ and the other a straight line with slope $-20$ dB/decade (or $^{-6}$ dB 'octave) for the frequency range $1/T<\\omega<\\infty.$ .The exact log-magnitude curve, the asymptotes, and the exact phase-angle curve are shown in Figure 7–6.  \n\nThe frequency at which the two asymptotes meet is called the corner frequency or break frequency. For the factor $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ , the frequency $\\omega=1/T$ is the corner frequency, since at $\\omega=1/T$ the two asymptotes have the same value. (The low-frequency asymptotic expression at $\\omega=1/T$ is $20\\ \\mathrm{log}\\ 1\\ \\mathrm{dB}=\\,0$ dB, and the high-frequency asymptotic expression at $\\omega=1/T$ is also $20\\log1\\ \\mathrm{dB}=0$ dB.) The corner frequency divides the frequency-response curve into two regions: a curve for the low-frequency region and a curve for the high-frequency region.The corner frequency is very important in sketching logarithmic frequency-response curves.  \n\nThe graph presents a comparison of four different curves: asymptote, exact curve, corner frequency, and another asymptote. The x-axis is labeled \"ω\" and spans from 1/20T to 20/T, while the y-axis is labeled \"dB\" and ranges from -90° to 10 dB.\n\nEach curve is distinguished by a unique label:\n\n*   **Asymptote**: A straight line that approaches but never intersects the exact curve.\n*   **Exact Curve**: The actual response of the system being analyzed.\n*   **Corner Frequency**: A point on the graph where the slope changes, often indicating a shift from one type of behavior to another.\n*   **Another Asymptote**: A second straight line that also approaches but never intersects the exact curve.\n\nThe graph provides a visual representation of how these different curves relate to each other, allowing for a better understanding of the system's response characteristics. 7–6 Log-magnitude curve, together with the asymptotes, and phase-angle curve of $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ .  \n\nThe exact phase angle $\\phi$ of the factor $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\phi=-\\mathrm{tan}^{-1}\\omega T\n$$  \n\nAt zero frequency, the phase angle is $0^{\\circ}$ .At the corner frequency, the phase angle is  \n\n$$\n\\phi=-\\mathsf{t a n}^{-1}\\frac{T}{T}=-\\mathsf{t a n}^{-1}1=-45^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nAt infinity, the phase angle becomes $-90^{\\circ}$ . Since the phase angle is given by an inversetangent function, the phase angle is skew symmetric about the inflection point at $\\phi=-45^{\\circ}$ .  \n\nThe error in the magnitude curve caused by the use of asymptotes can be calculated. 1 The maximum error occurs at the corner frequency and is approximately equal to $^{-3}$ dB, since  \n\n$$\n-20\\log\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,1}\\,+\\,20\\log1\\,=\\,-10\\log2\\,=\\,-3.03\\;\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThe error at the frequency one octave below the corner frequency—that is, at $\\omega=1/(2T)$ —is  \n\n$$\n-20\\log{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+1}}\\,+\\,20\\log1=-20\\log{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}}=-0.97\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThe error at the frequency one octave above the corner frequency—that is,at $\\omega=2/T.$ —is  \n\n$$\n-20\\log{\\sqrt{2^{2}+1}}\\,+\\,20\\log2\\,=-20\\log{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}}=-0.97\\,{\\mathrm{dB}}\n$$  \n\nThus, the error at one octave below or above the corner frequency is approximately equal to $-1$ dB. Similarly, the error at one decade below or above the corner frequency is approximately $-0.04$ dB. The error in decibels involved in using the asymptotic expression for the frequency-response curve of $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ is shown in Figure 7–7. The error is symmetric with respect to the corner frequency.  \n\nSince the asymptotes are quite easy to draw and are sufficiently close to the exact curve, the use of such approximations in drawing Bode diagrams is convenient in establishing the general nature of the frequency-response characteristics quickly with a minimum amount of calculation and may be used for most preliminary design work. If accurate frequency-response curves are desired, corrections may easily be made by referring to the curve given in Figure 7–7. In practice, an accurate frequency-response curve can be drawn by introducing a correction of $3\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ at the corner frequency and a correction of 1 dB at points one octave below and above the corner frequency and then connecting these points by a smooth curve.  \n\nNote that varying the time constant $T$ shifts the corner frequency to the left or to the right, but the shapes of the log-magnitude and the phase-angle curves remain the same.  \n\nThe transfer function $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ has the characteristics of a low-pass filter. For frequencies above $\\omega=1/T$ , the log magnitude falls off rapidly toward $-\\infty,$ .This is essentially due to the presence of the time constant. In the low-pass filter, the output can follow a sinusoidal input faithfully at low frequencies. But as the input frequency is increased, the output cannot follow the input because a certain amount of time is required for the system to build up in magnitude. Thus, at high frequencies, the amplitude of the output approaches zero and the phase angle of the output approaches $-90^{\\circ}$ .Therefore, if the input function contains many harmonics, then the low-frequency components are reproduced faithfully at the output, while the highfrequency components are attenuated in amplitude and shifted in phase.Thus, a firstorder element yields exact, or almost exact, duplication only for constant or slowly varying phenomena.  \n\nAn advantage of the Bode diagram is that for reciprocal factors—for example, the factor $1+j\\omega T$ —the log-magnitude and the phase-angle curves need only be changed in sign, since  \n\n$$\n20\\log|1\\,+\\,j\\omega T|\\,=\\,-20\\log\\left|\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}\\right|\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each displaying different types of curves. The top section features a curve labeled \"Corner frequency\" accompanied by an arrow pointing downwards, while the bottom section contains a small graph.\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n*   **Curve:** A single curve is depicted in this section.\n*   **Labeling:** The curve is labeled as \"Corner frequency.\"\n*   **Arrow:** An arrow points downwards from the label to indicate the direction of measurement or calculation.\n*   **Graph:** The background of the top section resembles graph paper, with dotted lines and numbers.\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n*   **Graph:** A small graph is present in this section.\n*   **Content:** Unfortunately, the contents of the bottom graph are not clearly visible due to its small size and low resolution.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two sections: one featuring a curve labeled \"Corner frequency\" with an arrow pointing downwards on a graph paper-like background, and another containing a smaller, unclear graph. 7–7 Log-magnitude error in the asymptotic expression of the frequency-response curve of $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ .  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\left/1\\,+\\,j\\omega T=\\tan^{-1}\\omega T=-\\left/\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}\\right.\n$$  \n\nThe corner frequency is the same for both cases. The slope of the high-frequency asymptote of $1+j\\omega T$ is $20\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ 'decade,and the phase angle varies from $0^{\\circ}$ to $90^{\\circ}$ as the frequency $\\omega$ is increased from zero to infinity. The log-magnitude curve, together with the asymptotes, and the phase-angle curve for the factor $1+j\\omega T$ are shown in Figure 7–8.  \n\nTo draw a phase curve accurately, we have to locate several points on the curve.The phase angles of $(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)^{\\mp1}$ are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c}{\\displaystyle\\mp45^{\\circ}}&{\\mathrm{~at~}}&{\\displaystyle\\omega=\\frac{1}{T}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\mp26.6^{\\circ}}&{\\mathrm{~at~}}&{\\displaystyle\\omega=\\frac{1}{2T}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\mp5.7^{\\circ}}&{\\mathrm{~at~}}&{\\displaystyle\\omega=\\frac{1}{10T}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\mp63.4^{\\circ}}&{\\mathrm{~at~}}&{\\displaystyle\\omega=\\frac{2}{T}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\mp84.3^{\\circ}}&{\\mathrm{~at~}}&{\\displaystyle\\omega=\\frac{10}{T}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor the case where a given transfer function involves terms like $\\left(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T\\right)^{\\mp n}$ ,a similar asymptotic construction may be made.The corner frequency is still at $\\omega=1/T$ , and the asymptotes are straight lines.The low-frequency asymptote is a horizontal straight line  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating the relationship between frequency and amplitude response in signal processing. The diagram is divided into two main sections, each displaying different aspects of this relationship.\n\n**Section 1: Bode Plot**\n\n*   **Frequency Response**: This section shows how the amplitude of a signal changes as its frequency increases.\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency (in Hz), while the y-axis represents amplitude (in decibels).\n    *   The graph features three distinct regions:\n        *   Low-frequency region: A flat line indicating no change in amplitude at low frequencies.\n        *   Transition band: A gradual increase in amplitude as frequency increases, followed by a steep slope where the amplitude rises sharply.\n        *   High-frequency region: Another flat line showing minimal change in amplitude beyond a certain point.\n*   **Asymptotes**: The diagram includes asymptotic lines that intersect the x-axis at specific frequencies. These asymptotes represent the maximum and minimum amplitudes of the signal's frequency response.\n\n**Section 2: Phase Response**\n\n*   **Phase Angle vs. Frequency**: This section examines how the phase angle of a signal changes with increasing frequency.\n    *   The x-axis again represents frequency (in Hz), while the y-axis measures phase angle in degrees.\n    *   The graph displays two distinct regions:\n        *   Low-frequency region: A horizontal line indicating no change in phase angle at low frequencies.\n        *   High-frequency region: A linear increase in phase angle as frequency increases.\n\n**Key Points and Observations**\n\n*   **Frequency Response**: The diagram illustrates the amplitude response of a signal across different frequency ranges, highlighting regions where the amplitude remains constant or changes significantly.\n*   **Phase Response**: The section on phase response demonstrates how the phase angle of a signal evolves with increasing frequency, showing regions where the phase remains stable and areas where it increases linearly.\n*   **Asymptotes**: The inclusion of asymptotic lines in both sections provides insight into the upper and lower bounds of the amplitude response, offering valuable information for filtering or manipulating signals.\n\nIn summary, the diagram effectively visualizes the interplay between frequency and amplitude/phase responses in signal processing. By analyzing these relationships, engineers can better understand how to optimize filter designs, enhance signal quality, and address various applications in fields like audio engineering, telecommunications, and data analysis. 7–8 Log-magnitude curve, together with the asymptotes, and phase-angle curve for $1+j\\omega T$ .  \n\nat $\\mathrm{0~dB}$ , while the high-frequency asymptote has the slope of $-20n$ dB 'decade or $20n$ dB 'decade.

If $0<\\zeta<1$ , this quadratic factor is the product of two complexconjugate factors.Asymptotic approximations to the frequency-response curves are not accurate for a factor with low values of $\\zeta.$ . This is because the magnitude and phase of the quadratic factor depend on both the corner frequency and the damping ratio $\\zeta$ .  \n\nThe asymptotic frequency-response curve may be obtained as follows: Since  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|\\frac{1}{1+2\\zeta\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)\\,+\\,\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)^{2}}\\right|\\,=\\,-20\\log\\sqrt{\\bigg(1\\,-\\,\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}\\bigg)^{2}\\,+\\,\\bigg(2\\zeta\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nfor low frequencies such that $\\omega\\ll\\omega_{n}$ , the log magnitude becomes  \n\n$$\n-20\\log1=0\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThe low-frequency asymptote is thus a horizontal line at 0 dB.

Near the frequency $\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}$ , a resonant peak occurs, as may be expected from Equation (7–7). The damping ratio $\\zeta$ determines the magnitude of this resonant peak. Errors obviously exist in the approximation by straight-line asymptotes. The magnitude of the error depends on the value of $\\zeta.$ . It is large for small values of $\\zeta.$ . Figure 7–9 shows the exact log-magnitude curves, together with the straight-line asymptotes and the exact phase-angle curves for the quadratic factor given by Equation (7–7) with several values of rection at a sufficient number of frequency points may be obtained from Figure $\\zeta$ .

From Equation (7–12), it can be seen that for $\\zeta>0.707$ ,there is no resonant peak.The magnitude $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ decreases monotonically with increasing frequency $\\omega$ . (The magnitude is less than 0 dB for all values of $\\omega>0,$ . Recall that, for $0.7<\\zeta<1$ , the step response is oscillatory, but the oscillations are well damped and are hardly perceptible.)  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a single curve, which appears to be a plot of some function against an unspecified variable.

MATLAB provides an easy way to plot Bode diagrams. (The MATLAB approach is presented later in this section.) Here, however, we consider the case where we want to draw Bode diagrams manually without using MATLAB.  \n\nFirst rewrite the sinusoidal transfer function $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ as a product of basic factors discussed above.Then identify the corner frequencies associated with these basic factors. Finally,draw the asymptotic log-magnitude curves with proper slopes between the corner frequencies. The exact curve, which lies close to the asymptotic curve, can be obtained by adding proper corrections.  \n\nThe phase-angle curve of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ can be drawn by adding the phase-angle curves of individual factors.  \n\nThe use of Bode diagrams employing asymptotic approximations requires much less time than other methods that may be used for computing the frequency response of a transfer function. The ease of plotting the frequency-response curves for a given transfer function and the ease of modification of the frequency-response curve as compensation is added are the main reasons why Bode diagrams are very frequently used in practice.  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{10(j\\omega+3)}{(j\\omega)(j\\omega+2)\\big[(j\\omega)^{2}+j\\omega+2\\big]}\n$$  \n\nMake corrections so that the log-magnitude curve is accurate.  \n\nTo avoid any possible mistakes in drawing the log-magnitude curve,it is desirable to put $G(j\\omega)$ in the following normalized form, where the low-frequency asymptotes for the first-order factors and the second-order factor are the 0-dB line:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{7.5\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\frac{j\\omega}{3}+1\\bigg)}{(j\\omega)\\bigg(\\displaystyle\\frac{j\\omega}{2}+1\\bigg)\\bigg[\\displaystyle\\frac{(j\\omega)^{2}}{2}+\\frac{j\\omega}{2}+1\\bigg]}\n$$  \n\nThis function is composed of the following factors:  \n\n$$\n7.5,~~~~~(j\\omega)^{-1},~~~~~1+j\\frac{\\omega}{3},~~~~~\\bigg(1+j\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\bigg)^{-1},~~~~~\\bigg[1+j\\frac{\\omega}{2}+\\frac{(j\\omega)^{2}}{2}\\bigg]^{-1}\n$$  \n\nThe corner frequencies of the third, fourth, and fifth terms are $\\omega\\,=\\,3,\\,\\omega\\,=\\,2$ , and $\\omega=\\sqrt{2}$ ,respectively. Note that the last term has the damping ratio of 0.3536.  \n\nTo plot the Bode diagram, the separate asymptotic curves for each of the factors are shown 1 1 in Figure 7–11.The composite curve is then obtained by algebraically adding the individual curves, also shown in Figure 7–11. Note that when the individual asymptotic curves are added at each frequency, the slope of the composite curve is cumulative. Below $\\omega={\\sqrt{2}}$ 2, the plot has the slope of $-20$ dB 'decade.At the first corner frequency $\\omega=\\sqrt{2}$ 2, the slope changes to $-60$ dB 'decade and continues to the next corner frequency $\\omega=2$ , where the slope becomes $-80$ dB 'decade. At the last corner frequency $\\omega=3$ , the slope changes to $-60$ dB 'decade.  \n\nOnce such an approximate log-magnitude curve has been drawn, the actual curve can be obtained by adding corrections at each corner frequency and at frequencies one octave below and above the corner frequencies. For first-order factors $(1+\\,j\\omega T)^{\\mp1}$ , the corrections are $\\pm3$ dB at the corner frequency and $\\pm1$ dB at the frequencies one octave below and above the corner frequency. Corrections necessary for the quadratic factor are obtained from Figure 7–9.The exact log-magnitude curve for $G(j\\omega)$ is shown by a dashed curve in Figure 7–11.  \n\nNote that any change in the slope of the magnitude curve is made only at the corner frequencies of the transfer function $G(j\\omega)$ . Therefore, instead of drawing individual magnitude curves and adding them up, as shown, we may sketch the magnitude curve without sketching individual curves. We may start drawing the lowest-frequency portion of the straight line (that is, the straight line with the slope $-20\\ \\mathrm{dB}$ 'decade for $\\omega<\\sqrt{2}$ ). As the frequency is increased, we get the effect of the complex-conjugate poles (quadratic term) at the corner frequency $\\omega={\\sqrt{2}}$ .The complex-conjugate poles cause the slopes of the magnitude curve to change from $-20$ to $-60\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ 'decade. At the next corner frequency, $\\omega=2$ , the effect of the pole is to change the slope to $-80$ dB 'decade. Finally, at the corner frequency $\\omega=3$ , the effect of the zero is to change the slope from $-80$ to $-60\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ 'decade.  \n\nFor plotting the complete phase-angle curve, the phase-angle curves for all factors have to be sketched. The algebraic sum of all phase-angle curves provides the complete phase-angle curve, as shown in Figure 7–11.  \n\nThe image presents a pair of graphs, each featuring five distinct curves. The top graph is labeled \"Exact curve\" and includes four additional curves denoted as G(jω), 1, 3, 4, and 5. The bottom graph features two curves: G(jω) and an unlabeled curve identified by the number 5.\n\n**Top Graph:**\n\n*   **Exact Curve:** This curve serves as a reference point for comparison with the other four curves.\n*   **G(jω):** This curve is closely related to the exact curve but exhibits some deviations.\n*   **Curve 1:** Although not explicitly labeled, this curve appears to be similar in shape and magnitude to curve G(jω).\n*   **Curve 3:** Similar to curve 1, curve 3 shares similarities with curve G(jω) but differs slightly.\n*   **Curve 4:** Curve 4 is the closest match to the exact curve among all five curves.\n*   **Curve 5:** This curve deviates significantly from both the exact curve and curve G(jω).\n\n**Bottom Graph:**\n\n*   **G(jω):** The graph displays the same curve as in the top graph, with a focus on its relationship to the unlabeled curve.\n*   **Unlabeled Curve (5):** This curve is similar in shape to curve 5 from the top graph but does not follow the exact curve or curve G(jω) as closely.\n\nIn summary, the image compares various curves, including an \"exact\" reference curve, with four other curves labeled G(jω), 1, 3, and 4. The bottom graph highlights the relationship between these curves, particularly focusing on the deviation of the unlabeled curve from the others. 7–11 Bode diagram of the system considered in Example 7–3.  \n\nMinimum-Phase Systems and Nonminimum-Phase Systems. Transfer functions having neither poles nor zeros in the right-half $s$ plane are minimum-phase transfer functions, whereas those having poles and/or zeros in the right-half $s$ plane are nonminimum-phase transfer functions. Systems with minimum-phase transfer functions are called minimum-phase systems, whereas those with nonminimum-phase transfer functions are called nonminimum-phase systems.  \n\nFor systems with the same magnitude characteristic, the range in phase angle of the minimum-phase transfer function is minimum among all such systems, while the range in phase angle of any nonminimum-phase transfer function is greater than this minimum.  \n\nIt is noted that for a minimum-phase system, the transfer function can be uniquely determined from the magnitude curve alone. For a nonminimum-phase system, this is not the case. Multiplying any transfer function by all-pass filters does not alter the magnitude curve, but the phase curve is changed.  \n\nConsider as an example the two systems whose sinusoidal transfer functions are, respectively,  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(j\\omega)=\\frac{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{1}},\\qquad G_{2}(j\\omega)=\\frac{1\\,-\\,j\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{1}},\\qquad0<T<T_{1}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a visual representation of mathematical equations, specifically Fourier transform pairs. The diagram is divided into two sections, each representing a different pair of equations.\n\n*   **Section 1:**\n    *   This section displays a graphical representation of the equation G1(s) = 1 + Ts / (1 + T1s).\n    *   The graph shows how the function changes as s varies from -∞ to ∞.\n    *   The x-axis represents the variable s, and the y-axis represents the value of the function G1(s).\n    *   The graph is symmetric about the origin, indicating that the function has even symmetry.\n*   **Section 2:**\n    *   This section displays a graphical representation of the equation G2(s) = (1 - Ts) / (1 + T1s).\n    *   The graph shows how the function changes as s varies from -∞ to ∞.\n    *   The x-axis represents the variable s, and the y-axis represents the value of the function G2(s).\n    *   The graph is also symmetric about the origin, indicating that the function has even symmetry.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a visual representation of two Fourier transform pairs, G1(s) and G2(s), which are related to each other through the equations provided. The graphs show how the functions change as s varies from -∞ to ∞, highlighting their symmetries and properties. 7–12 Pole–zero configurations of a minimum-phase system $G_{1}(s)$ and nonminimum-phase system $G_{2}(s)$ .  \n\nThe pole–zero configurations of these systems are shown in Figure 7–12.The two sinusoidal transfer functions have the same magnitude characteristics, but they have different phase-angle characteristics, as shown in Figure 7–13.These two systems differ from each other by the factor  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{1-j\\omega T}{1+j\\omega T}\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude of the factor $(1\\,-\\,j\\omega T)/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ is always unity. But the phase angle equals $-2\\tan^{-1}\\omega T$ and varies from $0^{\\circ}$ to $-180^{\\circ}$ as $\\omega$ is increased from zero to infinity.  \n\nAs stated earlier, for a minimum-phase system, the magnitude and phase-angle characteristics are uniquely related. This means that if the magnitude curve of a system is specified over the entire frequency range from zero to infinity, then the phase-angle curve is uniquely determined, and vice versa. This, however, does not hold for a nonminimum-phase system.  \n\nNonminimum-phase situations may arise in two different ways. One is simply when a system includes a nonminimum-phase element or elements. The other situation may arise in the case where a minor loop is unstable.  \n\nFor a minimum-phase system, the phase angle at $\\omega=\\infty$ becomes $-90^{\\circ}(q\\mathrm{~-~}p)$ ,where $p$ and $q$ are the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials of the transfer function, respectively. For a nonminimum-phase system, the phase angle at $\\omega=\\infty$ differs from $-90^{\\circ}(q\\mathrm{~-~}p)$ . In either system, the slope of the log-magnitude curve at $\\omega=\\infty$ is equal to $-20(q\\mathrm{~-~}p)$ dB 'decade. It is therefore possible to detect whether the system is minimum phase by examining both the slope of the high-frequency asymptote of the log-magnitude curve and the phase angle at $\\omega=\\infty.$ If the slope of the log-magnitude curve as $\\omega$ approaches infinity is $-20(q\\mathrm{~-~}p)$ dB 'decade and the phase angle at $\\omega=\\infty$ is equal to $-90^{\\circ}(q\\mathrm{~-~}p)$ , then the system is minimum phase.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two curves, G1(jω) and G2(jω), plotted against ω on the x-axis and phase angle (in degrees) on the y-axis. The graph is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different range of values for ω.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **G1(jω):** This curve starts at 0° at low frequencies and increases to approximately 45° as ω approaches infinity.\n*   **G2(jω):** This curve begins at -90° and decreases gradually, approaching -180° as ω becomes very large.\n*   **Quadrants:** Each quadrant represents a specific range of values for ω:\n    *   Quadrant I: Low frequencies (0 < ω < 1)\n    *   Quadrant II: Intermediate frequencies (1 < ω < 10)\n    *   Quadrant III: High frequencies (10 < ω < 100)\n    *   Quadrant IV: Very high frequencies (ω > 100)\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   Both curves exhibit a linear relationship between ω and phase angle.\n*   The magnitude of the phase angles for G1(jω) is much smaller than that of G2(jω), indicating a greater impact on the overall system response.\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates the phase responses of two transfer functions, G1(jω) and G2(jω), over different ranges of frequencies. The curves provide valuable insights into the behavior of these systems under various conditions. 7–13 Phase-angle characteristics of the systems $G_{1}(s)$ and $G_{2}(s)$ shown in Figure 7–12.   \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nNonminimum-phase systems are slow in responding because of their faulty behavior at the start of a response. In most practical control systems, excessive phase lag should be carefully avoided.In designing a system,if fast speed of response is of primary importance, we should not use nonminimum-phase components. (A common example of nonminimum-phase elements that may be present in control systems is transport lag or dead time.)  \n\nIt is noted that the techniques of frequency-response analysis and design to be presented in this and the next chapter are valid for both minimum-phase and nonminimum-phase systems.  \n\nTransport Lag. Transport lag, which is also called dead time, is of nonminimumphase behavior and has an excessive phase lag with no attenuation at high frequencies. Such transport lags normally exist in thermal, hydraulic, and pneumatic systems.  \n\nConsider the transport lag given by  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,e^{-j\\omega T}\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude is always equal to unity, since  \n\n$$\n\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|\\,=\\,\\left|\\cos\\omega T\\,-\\,j\\sin\\omega T\\right|\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the log magnitude of the transport lag $e^{-j\\omega T}$ is equal to 0 dB. The phase angle of the transport lag is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\left/G(j\\omega)=-\\omega T\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{(radians)}\\right.}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle=-57.3\\;\\omega T\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{(degrees)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe phase angle varies linearly with the frequency $\\omega,$ .The phase-angle characteristic of transport lag is shown in Figure 7–14.  \n\nThe image displays a graph with two axes and a title.\n\n*   The x-axis is labeled \"ωT\" and ranges from 0.1 to 10.\n    *   It has major ticks at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.\n*   The y-axis is labeled \"e^(-jωT)\" and ranges from -600° to 0°.\n    *   It has major ticks at -600°, -500°, -400°, -300°, -200°, -100°, and 0°.\n\nThe graph appears to be a plot of the magnitude response of a signal or system, with the x-axis representing frequency (ω) and the y-axis representing amplitude. The title is not visible in the image, but based on the labels and formatting, it is likely related to signal processing or filter design.\n\nOverall, the graph provides information about the behavior of a signal or system across different frequencies, which can be useful for understanding its characteristics and performance. 7–14 Phase-angle characteristic of transport lag.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–4  \n\nDraw the Bode diagram of the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{e^{-j\\omega L}}{1+j\\omega T}\n$$  \n\nThe log magnitude is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{20\\log\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|\\,=\\,20\\log\\left|e^{-j\\omega L}\\right|\\,+\\,20\\log\\left|{\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}}\\right|}\\\\ &{=\\,0\\,+\\,20\\log\\left|{\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}}\\right|}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThe phase angle of $G(j\\omega)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{\\slash G(j\\omega)}{\\slash{G}(j\\omega)}=\\ \\Big\\langle e^{-j\\omega L}\\ +\\ \\middle/{\\frac{1}{1\\ +\\ j\\omega T}}}}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{=-\\omega L-\\ \\tan^{-1}{\\omega T}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe log-magnitude and phase-angle curves for this transfer function with $L\\,=\\,0.5$ and $T=1$ are shown in Figure 7–15.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode plot, a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The x-axis represents the logarithmic frequency (ω) in radians per second, while the y-axis represents the magnitude and phase angle in decibels (dB). \n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Magnitude Response:** The magnitude response is plotted on a linear scale, with the magnitude in dB on the y-axis. There are four distinct curves corresponding to different transfer functions.\n*   **Phase Angle Response:** The phase angle response is also plotted on a linear scale, with the phase angle in degrees on the right-hand side of the plot. \n*   **Transfer Functions:** Four distinct transfer functions are represented by separate lines:\n    *   **e^(-0.5jω)/ (1 + jω)**: This transfer function has a magnitude response that decreases rapidly at low frequencies and remains relatively constant at high frequencies.\n    *   **e^(-0.5jω) / (1 - jω)**: This transfer function exhibits a similar behavior to the first one, but with opposite phase shift.\n    *   **1 / (1 + jω)**: This transfer function has a magnitude response that decreases gradually at low frequencies and becomes more rapid at high frequencies.\n    *   **1 / (1 - jω)**: Similar to the third transfer function, but with an opposite phase shift.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the Bode plot provides valuable insights into the frequency response of a system. The magnitude and phase angle responses can be used to analyze the behavior of the system over different frequencies, allowing designers to optimize their systems for specific applications. 7–15 Bode diagram for the system $e^{-\\bar{j}\\omega L}/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ with $L=0.5$ and $T=1$  \n\nRelationship between System Type and Log-Magnitude Curve. Consider the unity-feedback control system.The static position, velocity, and acceleration error constants describe the low-frequency behavior of type 0, type 1, and type 2 systems, respectively. For a given system, only one of the static error constants is finite and significant. (The larger the value of the finite static error constant, the higher the loop gain is as $\\omega$ approaches zero.)  \n\nThe type of the system determines the slope of the log-magnitude curve at low frequencies. Thus, information concerning the existence and magnitude of the steadystate error of a control system to a given input can be determined from the observation of the low-frequency region of the log-magnitude curve.  \n\nDetermination of Static Position Error Constants. Consider the unity-feedback control system shown in Figure 7–16. Assume that the open-loop transfer function is given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{K\\bigl(T_{a}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(T_{b}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(T_{m}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}{s^{N}\\bigl(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(T_{p}s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{K\\bigl(T_{a}j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(T_{b}j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(T_{m}j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}{(j\\omega)^{N}\\bigl(T_{1}j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\bigl(T_{2}j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(T_{p}j\\omega\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–17 shows an example of the log-magnitude plot of a type 0 system. In such a system, the magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ equals $K_{p}$ at low frequencies, or  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to0}G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,K\\,=\\,K_{p}\n$$  \n\nIt follows that the low-frequency asymptote is a horizontal line at $20\\log K_{p}$ dB.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is used to analyze and design feedback control systems. The diagram consists of several blocks that represent different components of the system.\n\n*   **Input (R(s))**: This is the input signal to the system, represented by the variable R(s).\n*   **Transfer Function (G(s))**: This block represents the transfer function of the system, which describes how the output responds to changes in the input. The transfer function G(s) takes the input R(s) and produces an output C(s).\n*   **Output (C(s))**: This is the output signal of the system, represented by the variable C(s).\n\nThe diagram also shows that there is a feedback loop from the output back to the input through the error detector block E(s). The error detector measures the difference between the desired output and the actual output, and this error signal is fed back into the system.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a simple control system with an input, a transfer function, an output, and a feedback loop. This type of diagram is commonly used in control engineering to analyze and design feedback control systems. 7–16 Unity-feedback control system.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a logarithmic scale on both axes, featuring two distinct regions:\n\n*   **Region 1:** The leftmost portion of the graph exhibits a horizontal line at a value of 20 log Kp dB. This region is labeled as \"dB\" and includes an arrow pointing to the top-right corner.\n*   **Region 2:** Moving to the right, the graph transitions into a curved section that slopes downward. This area is characterized by a label reading \"-20 dB/decade,\" accompanied by an arrow pointing towards the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Additional Labels:**\n\n*   The x-axis is labeled as \"ω in log s.\"\n*   A second label appears on the right side of the graph, indicating \"-40 dB/decade\" with another arrow directed towards the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   The graph displays a clear distinction between two regions, each with its own unique characteristics and labels.\n*   The use of logarithmic scales on both axes allows for a more nuanced representation of the data, enabling the visualization of complex relationships and patterns. 7–17 Log-magnitude curve of a type 0 system.  \n\nDetermination of Static Velocity Error Constants. Consider the unity-feedback control system shown in Figure 7–16.Figure 7–18 shows an example of the log-magnitude plot of a type 1 system. The intersection of the initial –20 -dB 'decade segment (or its extension) with the line $\\omega=1$ has the magnitude $20\\log K_{v}$ .This may be seen as follows: In a type 1 system  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{K_{v}}{j\\omega},~~~~~\\mathrm{for}\\;\\omega\\;\\ll\\;1\n$$  \n\nThus,  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|\\frac{K_{v}}{j\\omega}\\right|_{\\omega=1}=20\\log K_{v}\n$$  \n\nThe intersection of the initial –20 -dB 'decade segment (or its extension) with the 0-dB line has a frequency numerically equal to $K_{v}$ . To see this, define the frequency at this intersection to be $\\omega_{1}$ ; then  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{K_{v}}{j\\omega_{1}}\\right|\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK_{v}\\,=\\,\\omega_{1}\n$$  \n\nAs an example, consider the type 1 system with unity feedback whose open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{K}{s(J s\\,+\\,F)}\n$$  \n\nIf we define the corner frequency to be $\\omega_{2}$ and the frequency at the intersection of the –40 -dB 'decade segment (or its extension) with 0-dB line to be $\\omega_{3}$ , then  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{2}=\\frac{F}{J},~~~~~~\\omega_{3}^{2}=\\frac{K}{J}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes: the x-axis (ω) and the y-axis (dB). The graph features several lines, each representing a different function or relationship between ω and dB. \n\n*   **Lines on the Graph**\n    *   There are four distinct lines on the graph:\n        1.  A line labeled \"-20 dB/decade\" that starts at approximately -40 dB on the y-axis and increases to around -60 dB as it moves from left to right along the x-axis.\n        2.  A line marked \"20 log K_v\" that begins at roughly -10 dB on the y-axis and decreases to about -30 dB as it extends from left to right along the x-axis.\n        3.  A line labeled \"-40 dB/decade\" that starts near -80 dB on the y-axis and continues to decrease, reaching approximately -100 dB towards the end of its span along the x-axis.\n        4.  A line denoted as \"ω = 1\" that is horizontal, indicating no change in the value being measured (dB) along the x-axis.\n\n*   **Labels on the Axes**\n    *   The y-axis is labeled \"dB\", representing decibels, while the x-axis is labeled \"ω\", which could stand for frequency or another variable depending on the context of the graph. \n    *   The origin of both axes is at (0, 0), where ω = 1 and dB = 0.\n\n*   **Intersection Points**\n    *   Three intersection points are visible:\n        1.  One intersection occurs between the \"-20 dB/decade\" line and the \"ω = 1\" line, located near -30 dB on the y-axis.\n        2.  Another intersection is observed where the \"20 log K_v\" line crosses the \"ω = 1\" line, positioned roughly at -15 dB on the y-axis.\n        3.  The third intersection point is situated between the \"-40 dB/decade\" line and the \"ω = 1\" line, located near -50 dB on the y-axis.\n\n*   **Overall Interpretation**\n    *   Without specific labels or context for ω (e.g., frequency), it's challenging to provide a detailed explanation of what each line represents in terms of physical phenomena. However, based solely on their mathematical descriptions:\n        1.  The \"-20 dB/decade\" and \"-40 dB/decade\" lines likely describe the rate at which signal power or amplitude decreases as a function of increasing ω (frequency).\n        2.  The \"20 log K_v\" line might be related to gain, attenuation, or another variable's dependence on ω.\n\nIn summary, while the graph offers insights into the relationships between dB and ω, further clarification is necessary to accurately interpret these findings within a specific context or field of study. 7–18 Log-magnitude curve of a type 1 system.   \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}=K_{v}=\\frac{K}{F}\n$$  \n\nit follows that  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}\\omega_{2}=\\omega_{3}^{2}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega_{1}}{\\omega_{3}}=\\frac{\\omega_{3}}{\\omega_{2}}\n$$  \n\nOn the Bode diagram,  \n\n$$\n\\log\\omega_{1}\\,-\\,\\log\\omega_{3}\\,=\\,\\log\\omega_{3}\\,-\\,\\log\\omega_{2}\n$$  \n\nThus, the $\\omega_{3}$ point is just midway between the $\\omega_{2}$ and $\\omega_{1}$ points.The damping ratio $\\zeta$ of the system is then  \n\n$$\n\\zeta={\\frac{F}{2{\\sqrt{K J}}}}={\\frac{\\omega_{2}}{2\\omega_{3}}}\n$$  \n\nDetermination of Static Acceleration Error Constants.

The command bode computes magnitudes and phase angles of the frequency response of continuous-time, linear, timeinvariant systems.  \n\nWhen the command bode (without left-hand arguments) is entered in the computer, MATLAB produces a Bode plot on the screen. Most commonly used bode commands are  \n\nbode(num,den)bode(num,den,w)bode(A,B,C,D) bode(A,B,C,D,w) bode(A,B,C,D,iu,w) bode(sys)  \n\nWhen invoked with left-hand arguments, such as  \n\n$$\n[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(num,den,w)}\n$$  \n\nbode returns the frequency response of the system in matrices mag ,phase , and w. No plot is drawn on the screen.The matrices mag and phase contain magnitudes and phase angles of the frequency response of the system, evaluated at user-specified frequency points.The phase angle is returned in degrees.The magnitude can be converted to decibels with the statement  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{magdB}=20^{*}|\\mathrm{og}10(\\mathrm{mag})\n$$  \n\nOther Bode commands with left-hand arguments are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(num,den)}}}\\\\ {{[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(num,den,w)}}}\\\\ {{[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(A,B,C,D)}}}\\\\ {{[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(A,B,C,D,w)}}}\\\\ {{[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(A,B,C,D,iu,w)}}}\\\\ {{[\\mathrm{mag,phase,w}]=\\mathrm{bode(sys)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTo specify the frequency range, use the command logspace(d1,d2) or logspace $\\left(\\mathrm{d}1,\\mathrm{d}2,\\boldsymbol{\\mathsf{n}}\\right)$ . logspace(d1,d2) generates a vector of 50 points logarithmically equally spaced between decades $1\\,0^{{\\mathrm{d}}1}$ and $10^{\\mathrm{d2}}$ . (50 points include both endpoints. There are 48 points between the endpoints.) To generate 50 points between 0.1 rad 'sec and 100 rad 'sec, enter the command  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{w}=\\mathsf{l o g s p a c e}(-1,2)\n$$  \n\nlogspace(dl,d2,n) generates $n$ points logarithmically equally spaced between decades $10^{\\mathrm{d1}}$ and $10^{\\mathrm{d2}}$ . ( $\\boldsymbol{n}$ points include both endpoints.) For example, to generate 100 points including both endpoints between 1 rad 'sec and 1000 rad 'sec,enter the following command:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{w}=|\\mathrm{ogspace}(0,3,100)\n$$  \n\nTo incorporate the user-specified frequency points when plotting Bode diagrams, the bode command must include the frequency vector w, such as bode(num,den,w) and [mag,phase,w] $=$ bode(A,B,C,D,w) .  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–5 Consider the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{25}{s^{2}+4s+25}}\n$$  \n\nPlot a Bode diagram for this transfer function.

[When the numerator and denominator contain the polynomial coefficients in descending powers of $s$ ,bode(num,den) draws the Bode diagram.] MATLAB Program 7–1 shows a program to plot the Bode diagram for this system.The resulting Bode diagram is shown in Figure 7–20.  \n\nThe image displays a code snippet for a line graph using MATLAB.

To create a line graph, additional commands or functions would be required to visualize the data associated with these parameters.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, comprising two graphs: one for magnitude and another for phase. The top graph illustrates the magnitude response of the system, while the bottom graph displays the phase response.\n\n**Key Features of the Diagram**\n\n*   **Magnitude Response**\n    *   The magnitude response is depicted in decibels (dB) on the y-axis.\n    *   Frequency is measured in radians per second (rad/sec) on the x-axis.\n    *   The plot shows a gradual decrease in magnitude as frequency increases, indicating a low-pass filter characteristic.\n*   **Phase Response**\n    *   The phase response is shown in degrees on the y-axis.\n    *   Frequency is again measured in rad/sec on the x-axis.\n    *   The plot reveals a linear increase in phase as frequency increases, suggesting a constant group delay.\n\n**System Characteristics**\n\n*   **Cutoff Frequency**: Approximately 10 rad/sec\n*   **Magnitude at Cutoff**: Around -20 dB\n*   **Phase at Cutoff**: Approximately -90 degrees\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagram illustrates the frequency response of a system with a low-pass filter characteristic, characterized by a gradual decrease in magnitude and a linear increase in phase as frequency increases. 7–20 Bode diagram of $G(s)={\\frac{25}{s^{2}+4s+25}}.$ .  \n\n#  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 7–21.The open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\frac{9\\Bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,0.2s\\,+\\,1\\Bigr)}{s\\Bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,1.2s\\,+\\,9\\Bigr)}\n$$  \n\nPlot a bode diagram.

The system is designed to process an input signal, represented by the arrow pointing into the top-left corner, which then passes through a series of blocks before being output.\n\n**Block 1: Adder**\n\n*   **Input:** s(t) - the input signal\n*   **Output:** s(t) + n(t) - the sum of the input and noise signals\n\n**Block 2: Integrator**\n\n*   **Input:** s(t) + n(t)\n*   **Output:** ∫(s(t) + n(t))dt - the integral of the input signal\n\n**Block 3: Differentiator**\n\n*   **Input:** ∫(s(t) + n(t))dt\n*   **Output:** (d/dt)(∫(s(t) + n(t))dt) - the derivative of the integral of the input signal\n\n**Block 4: Gain Amplifier**\n\n*   **Input:** (d/dt)(∫(s(t) + n(t))dt)\n*   **Output:** K(d/dt)(∫(s(t) + n(t))dt) - the amplified derivative of the integral of the input signal\n\n**Block 5: Output**\n\n*   **Input:** K(d/dt)(∫(s(t) + n(t))dt)\n*   **Output:** y(t) - the output signal, which is the result of processing the input signal through the system\n\nThe system consists of five blocks in a serial connection. The first block adds noise to the input signal, while the second and third blocks are integrators and differentiators that process the sum of the input and noise signals. The fourth block amplifies the derivative of the integral of the input signal, and the fifth block outputs the final result.\n\nIn summary, this system is designed to process an input signal by adding noise, integrating and differentiating the resulting signal, amplifying the derivative, and finally outputting the result.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: one for the magnitude (in dB) and another for the phase angle (in degrees). The x-axis represents the frequency in rad/sec, while the y-axis represents the magnitude in dB.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot:** The magnitude plot shows the gain of the system as a function of frequency. It indicates how much the signal is amplified or attenuated at different frequencies.\n*   **Phase Angle Plot:** The phase angle plot displays the shift in the phase of the signal with respect to time. A positive phase angle indicates that the signal leads, while a negative phase angle indicates it lags.\n*   **Frequency Axis:** The frequency axis ranges from 10^-2 rad/sec to 10^1 rad/sec, providing a comprehensive view of the system's behavior across various frequencies.\n*   **Magnitude and Phase Angle Labels:** The magnitude plot is labeled in dB, while the phase angle plot is labeled in degrees.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides valuable insights into the frequency response characteristics of the system. By examining the magnitude and phase angle plots, one can determine:\n\n*   **Gain at Specific Frequencies:** Identify the frequencies where the signal experiences significant amplification or attenuation.\n*   **Phase Shifts:** Determine the phase lead or lag at different frequencies, which is crucial for understanding signal processing applications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the Bode diagram offers a comprehensive visualization of a system's frequency response, enabling analysis and interpretation of its behavior across various frequencies. This tool is essential in fields such as electronics, control systems, and signal processing, where understanding the frequency characteristics of a system is vital for design and optimization purposes.  \n\nFigure 7–22   \nBode diagram of   \n$G(s)=\\frac{\\bar{9}\\bigl(s^{2}+0.2s\\,+\\,1\\bigr)}{s\\bigl(s^{2}+1.2s\\,+\\,9\\bigr)}.$  \n\nIf it is desired to plot the Bode diagram from 0.01 to 1000 rad 'sec, enter the following command:  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{w}=\\mathsf{l o g s p a c e}(-2,3,100)\n$$  \n\nThis command generates 100 points logarithmically equally spaced between 0.01 and 100 rad 'sec. (Note that such a vector wspecifies the frequencies in radians per second at which the frequency response will be calculated.)  \n\nIf we use the command bode(num,den,w)  \n\nthen the frequency range is as the user specified, but the magnitude range and phase-angle range will be automatically determined.

(More points are used when the response is changing rapidly.)  \n\nThe command bode(A,B,C,D,iu) , where iu is the i th input of the system, produces the Bode diagrams from the input iu to all the outputs $\\left({\\widehat{y}}_{1},y_{2},\\dots,y_{m}\\right)$ of the system, with a frequency range automatically determined. (The scalar iu is an index into the inputs of the system and specifies which input is to be used for plotting Bode diagrams). If the control vector $\\mathbf{u}$ has three inputs such that  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{u_{1}}\\\\ {u_{2}}\\\\ {u_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nthen iu must be set to either 1, 2, or 3.  \n\nIf the system has only one input $u$ , then either of the following commands may be used:  \n\nor  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–7 Consider the following system:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\left[\\dot{x}_{1}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{0}&{1}\\\\ {-25}&{-4}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{0}\\\\ {25}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!u}\\\\ {y=[1}&{0]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis system has one input $u$ and one output $y$ . By using the command  \n\nand entering MATLAB Program 7–4 into the computer, we obtain the Bode diagram shown in Figure 7–24.  \n\nThis image features a simple program written in MATLAB, presented in a monochrome format with black text on a white background. The code displays a clear structure, starting with the label \"MATLAB Program 7-4\" at the top.\n\nThe main content is organized into three sections:\n\n1. **Section A**: This section contains a single line of code: `A = [0 1;-25 -4];`. This defines a matrix named 'A' and initializes it with specific values.\n2. **Section B**: Another line of code is presented in this section: `B = [0;25];`. Similar to Section A, this defines a matrix named 'B' and assigns initial values.\n3. **Section C**: The final section includes two lines of code:\n   - `C = [1 0];`\n   - `D = [0];`\n\nThese definitions create matrices named 'C' and 'D', respectively, with their corresponding values.\n\nThe program concludes by specifying a title for the diagram: `\"Bode Diagram\"`. This suggests that the output of this MATLAB code is intended to be used in a Bode plot, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system.  \n\nIf we replace the command bode(A,B,C,D) in MATLAB Program 7–4 with  \n\nthen MATLAB will produce the Bode diagram identical to that shown in Figure 7–24.  \n\n# 7–3 POLAR PLOTS  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: one for magnitude and one for phase.\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot**\n    *   The magnitude plot shows the magnitude of the transfer function in decibels (dB) as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency, ranging from 10^0 rad/sec to 10^2 rad/sec.\n    *   The y-axis represents the magnitude in dB, ranging from -200 dB to 20 dB.\n    *   The plot shows a downward slope at low frequencies, indicating a decrease in magnitude as frequency increases.\n    *   There is a peak around 1000 rad/sec, followed by another drop-off towards higher frequencies.\n*   **Phase Plot**\n    *   The phase plot displays the phase angle of the transfer function in degrees as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency, ranging from 10^0 rad/sec to 10^2 rad/sec.\n    *   The y-axis represents the phase angle in degrees, ranging from -200° to 20°.\n    *   The plot shows a gradual increase in phase angle as frequency increases, with a more rapid change around 1000 rad/sec.\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response of a system, allowing for easy identification of its characteristics such as magnitude and phase. By analyzing these plots, one can gain insights into how the system responds to different frequencies and make informed decisions about its design or performance optimization. 7–24 Bode diagram of the system considered in Example 7–7.   \nFrequency (rad/sec)  \n\nThe polar plot of a sinusoidal transfer function $G(j\\omega)$ is a plot of the magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ versus the phase angle of $G(j\\omega)$ on polar coordinates as $\\omega$ is varied from zero to infinity.Thus, the polar plot is the locus of vectors $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|\\underbar{|G(j\\omega)|}$ as $\\omega$ is varied from zero to infinity. Note that in polar plots a positive (negative) phase angle is measured counterclockwise (clockwise) from the positive real axis.The polar plot is often called the Nyquist plot.An example of such a plot is shown in Figure 7–25. Each point on the polar plot of $G(j\\omega)$ represents the terminal point of a vector at a particular value of $\\omega$ . In the polar plot, it is important to show the frequency graduation of the locus. The projections of $G(j\\omega)$ on the real and imaginary axes are its real and imaginary components.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with multiple lines, curves, and arrows. The purpose of the graph is to illustrate the relationship between different variables.\n\n* A line:\n\t+ The line is straight and horizontal.\n\t+ It spans from -2 to 2 on the x-axis.\n\t+ There are no labels or annotations on this line.\n* An arrow:\n\t+ The arrow points upwards and to the right.\n\t+ It originates from the origin (0, 0) of the graph.\n\t+ The arrow has a length of approximately 3 units.\n* A curve:\n\t+ The curve is smooth and continuous.\n\t+ It starts at the point (-1, -1) and ends at the point (1, 1).\n\t+ There are no labels or annotations on this curve.\n\nThe graph appears to be a simple illustration of a mathematical concept, possibly related to geometry or trigonometry. The presence of an arrow suggests movement or direction, while the curve may represent a function or relationship between variables.  \n\nMATLAB may be used to obtain a polar plot $G(j\\omega)$ or to obtain $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ and $\\underline{{\\langle G(j\\omega)\\rangle}}$ accurately for various values of $\\omega$ in the frequency range of interest.  \n\nAn advantage in using a polar plot is that it depicts the frequency-response characteristics of a system over the entire frequency range in a single plot. One disadvantage is that the plot does not clearly indicate the contributions of each individual factor of the open-loop transfer function.  \n\nIntegral and Derivative Factors $(j\\omega)^{\\mp1}$ .The polar plot of $G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,1/j\\omega$ is the negative imaginary axis, since  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{1}{j\\omega}=-j\\,\\frac{1}{\\omega}=\\frac{1}{\\omega}\\,\\frac{-90^{\\circ}}{-90^{\\circ}}\n$$  \n\nThe polar plot of $G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,j\\omega$ is the positive imaginary axis.  \n\nFirst-Order Factors $(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)^{\\mp1}$ .For the sinusoidal transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}}\\:\\bigg\\lbrack{-\\mathrm{tan}^{-1}\\omega T}\\:\n$$  \n\nthe values of $G(j\\omega)$ at $\\omega\\,=\\,0$ and $\\omega=1/T$ are, respectively,  \n\n$$\nG(j0)\\,=\\,1\\,\\underline{{{/0^{\\circ}}}}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad G\\biggl(j\\,\\frac{1}{T}\\biggr)\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\,\\underline{{{/-45^{\\circ}}}}\n$$  \n\nIf $\\omega$ approaches infinity, the magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ approaches zero and the phase angle approaches $-90^{\\circ}$ .The polar plot of this transfer function is a semicircle as the frequency $\\omega$ is varied from zero to infinity, as shown in Figure 7–26(a).The center is located at 0.5 on the real axis, and the radius is equal to 0.5.  \n\nTo prove that the polar plot of the first-order factor $G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ is a semicircle, define  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,X\\,+\\,j Y\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with mathematical equations and symbols, likely from a mathematics or engineering context.

The diagram shows that as the radius approaches infinity, the circle becomes larger and larger without bound. This visual representation helps to clarify the abstract concept of infinity in mathematical terms.  \n(b)  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{X=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}=\\mathrm{{\\real\\,part\\,of}\\,}G(j\\omega)}}\\\\ {{Y=\\displaystyle\\frac{-\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}=\\mathrm{{\\imaginary\\,part\\,of}\\,}G(j\\omega)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"Im\" and \"Re\", which are commonly used to represent complex numbers.

The point plotted at (1,0) represents a real number with no imaginary component. The arrowhead symbol above this point suggests that the value of ω (likely representing the imaginary unit i) approaches infinity (∞).  \n\nFigure 7–27 Polar plot of $1+j\\omega T$ .  \n\nThen we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\left(X-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}+Y^{2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1-\\omega^{2}T^{2}}{1+\\omega^{2}T^{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{-\\omega T}{1+\\omega^{2}T^{2}}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$  \n\nThus, in the $X{-}Y$ plane $G(j\\omega)$ is a circle with center at $\\begin{array}{r}{X=\\frac{1}{2},Y=0}\\end{array}$ and with radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ ,as shown in Figure 7–26(b). The lower semicircle corresponds to $0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\infty$ , and the upper semicircle corresponds to $-\\infty\\leq\\omega\\leq0$ .  \n\nThe polar plot of the transfer function $1+j\\omega T$ is simply the upper half of the straight line passing through point (1,0) in the complex plane and parallel to the imaginary axis, as shown in Figure 7–27. The polar plot of $1+j\\omega T$ has an appearance completely different from that of $1/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)$ .  \n\nQuadratic Factors $\\left[1~+~2\\zeta(j\\omega/\\omega_{n})~+~(j\\omega/\\omega_{n})^{2}\\right]^{\\mp1}$ .The low- and high-frequency portions of the polar plot of the following sinusoidal transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{1}{\\,1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)\\,+\\,\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)^{2}},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\zeta>0\n$$  \n\nare given, respectively, by  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to0}G(j\\omega)=1\\big/0^{\\circ}\\quad\\mathrm{and}\\quad\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to\\infty}G(j\\omega)=0\\big/-180^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe polar plot of this sinusoidal transfer function starts at $1\\,\\mathrm{\\textmu}^{\\mathrm{1}}$ and ends at $0\\,{\\Big/}{\\underline{{-180^{\\circ}}}}$ as $\\omega$ increases from zero to infinity. Thus, the high-frequency portion of $G(j\\omega)$ is tangent to the negative real axis.  \n\nThe image presents a complex plane plot, featuring multiple curves and labels. The purpose of the image is to illustrate the relationship between different variables in a mathematical context.\n\n* A complex plane plot with several curves and labels:\n\t+ The x-axis represents the real part of the variable.\n\t+ The y-axis represents the imaginary part of the variable.\n* The plot has two main curves, one labeled \"ω=0\" and the other labeled \"ω=infinity\":\n\t+ The curve labeled \"ω=0\" is a horizontal line that passes through the origin (0, 0).\n\t+ The curve labeled \"ω=infinity\" is a vertical line that extends upwards from the origin.\n* There are also several smaller curves and labels scattered throughout the plot:\n\t+ A small circle with the label \"(ζ: Large)\" is located near the top-right corner of the plot.\n\t+ Several short horizontal lines with arrows pointing to the right are placed along the x-axis, labeled \"Im\" and \"Re\".\n* The background of the image is a light gray color.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be related to complex analysis or signal processing, as it features variables such as ω (omega) and ζ (zeta), which are commonly used in these fields. The plot suggests that there may be some relationship between the real and imaginary parts of the variable, although the exact nature of this relationship is not immediately clear from the image alone.  \n\n# Figure 7–28 Polar plots of $\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\!\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\right)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\right)^{2}}$ for $\\zeta>0$ .  \n\nExamples of polar plots of the transfer function just considered are shown in Figure 7–28. The exact shape of a polar plot depends on the value of the damping ratio $\\zeta$ , but the general shape of the plot is the same for both the underdamped case ($1>\\zeta>0$ )and overdamped case $(\\zeta>1)$ ).  \n\nFor the underdamped case at $\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}$ , we have $G(j\\omega_{n})\\,=\\,1/(j2\\zeta)$ , and the phase angle at $\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}$ is $-90^{\\circ}$ . Therefore, it can be seen that the frequency at which the $G(j\\omega)$ locus intersects the imaginary axis is the undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ . In the polar plot, the frequency point whose distance from the origin is maximum corresponds to the resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ . The peak value of $G(j\\omega)$ is obtained as the ratio of the magnitude of the vector at the resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ to the magnitude of the vector at $\\omega\\,=\\,0.$ The resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ is indicated in the polar plot shown in Figure 7–29.  \n\nFor the overdamped case, as $\\zeta$ increases well beyond unity, the $G(j\\omega)$ locus approaches a semicircle. This may be seen from the fact that, for a heavily damped system, the characteristic roots are real, and one is much smaller than the other. Since, for sufficiently large $\\zeta$ , the effect of the larger root (larger in the absolute value) on the response becomes very small, the system behaves like a first-order one.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a single curve, labeled as \"Resonant peak,\" which exhibits a distinctive shape. The graph features two axes: one horizontal and one vertical.\n\n*   **Horizontal Axis (Re):**\n    *   Labeled as \"Re\"\n    *   Ranges from 0 to infinity\n    *   Features an arrowhead at both ends, indicating that it extends beyond the visible range\n*   **Vertical Axis (Im):**\n    *   Labeled as \"Im\"\n    *   Also ranges from 0 to infinity\n    *   Like the horizontal axis, it has an arrowhead at each end, suggesting extension beyond the viewable area\n\nThe graph displays a continuous curve with no visible breaks or discontinuities. The curve starts at approximately (0, 0), then increases in both directions along the axes but remains within the visible range until reaching the edge of the plot. Notably, the curve does not intersect either axis, as it is entirely above them.\n\nA few key points on the graph are marked with small circles or dots:\n\n*   One point is located near the origin (0, 0) and labeled \"ωr\" (omega r).\n*   Another point is positioned at approximately (1, 3), also denoted by \"ωn\" (omega n).\n\nThe background of the graph is plain white, providing a clean visual backdrop for the plotted data. Overall, the graph appears to be illustrating some form of resonance or oscillation phenomenon, given the presence of the terms ωr and ωn in the labels. 7–29 Polar plot showing the resonant peak and resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ .  \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nPolar plot of $1\\,+\\,2\\dot{\\zeta}\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)\\,+\\,\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{for}\\;\\zeta>0.$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, x and y, where the x-axis is labeled \"Re\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Im\". The graph features a curved line that begins at the origin (0, 0) and extends upward and to the right. This curve is labeled as \"ω\".\n\n*   The x-axis is labeled \"Re\", which suggests that it represents the real component of a complex number.\n    *   The y-axis is labeled \"Im\", indicating that it represents the imaginary component of a complex number.\n    *   The graph shows a curved line starting from the origin (0, 0) and extending upward and to the right.\n        *   This curve is labeled as \"ω\", which likely represents an angular frequency or some other parameter related to wave propagation or oscillations.\n            *   The curve appears to be a semicircle, with its center at the origin (0, 0).\n                *   The radius of the semicircle seems to be increasing linearly with the angle ω.\n                    *   This suggests that as the angular frequency increases, the amplitude of the oscillation or wave also increases.\n\nIn summary, the graph depicts a relationship between an angular frequency and its corresponding real and imaginary components. The curved line represents how these components change as the angular frequency increases.  \n\nNext, consider the following sinusoidal transfer function:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\right)^{2}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\,\\left(1\\,-\\,\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}\\right)\\,+\\,j\\bigg(\\frac{2\\zeta\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe low-frequency portion of the curve is  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to0}G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,1\\,\\underline{{{/0^{\\circ}}}}\n$$  \n\nand the high-frequency portion is  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to\\infty}G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\infty\\,\\underline{{{/180^{\\circ}}}}\n$$  \n\nSince the imaginary part of $G(j\\omega)$ is positive for $\\omega>0$ and is monotonically increasing, and the real part of $G(j\\omega)$ is monotonically decreasing from unity, the general shape of the polar plot of $G(j\\omega)$ is as shown in Figure 7–30. The phase angle is between $0^{\\circ}$ and $180^{\\circ}$ .  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–8  \n\nConsider the following second-order transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{1}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}}\n$$  \n\nSketch a polar plot of this transfer function.  \n\nSince the sinusoidal transfer function can be written  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{1}{j\\omega(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)}=-\\,\\frac{T}{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}\\,-\\,j\\,\\frac{1}{\\omega\\big(1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}\\big)}\n$$  \n\nthe low-frequency portion of the polar plot becomes  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to0}G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,-T\\,-\\,j\\infty\n$$  \n\nand the high-frequency portion becomes  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to\\infty}G(j\\omega)\\,=\\,0\\,-\\,j0\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–31   \nPolar plot of   \n$1/\\[j\\omega(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T)].$ .  \n\nThe figure shows a complex plane with a single curve that starts at an infinite distance along the imaginary axis and ends at an infinite distance along the real axis. The curve is labeled with Greek letters, specifically omega (ω) and tau (τ). The curve begins on the left side of the imaginary axis, where the real part is zero, and moves to the right as it approaches the origin. At this point, the curve reaches its lowest point before turning upward again.\n\nThe curve then continues along the real axis until it reaches an infinite distance, at which point the imaginary part becomes zero once more. The entire curve forms a semicircle that spans from infinity on the left side of the imaginary axis to infinity on the right side of the real axis.  \n\nThe general shape of the polar plot of $G(j\\omega)$ is shown in Figure 7–31. The $G(j\\omega)$ plot is asymptotic to the vertical line passing through the point $(-T,0)$ . Since this transfer function involves an integrator $(1/s)$ ,the general shape of the polar plot differs substantially from those of second-order transfer functions that do not have an integrator.  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–9 Obtain the polar plot of the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{e^{-j\\omega L}}{1+j\\omega T}\n$$  \n\nSince $G(j\\omega)$ can be written  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\bigl(e^{-j\\omega L}\\bigr)\\biggl(\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}\\biggr)\n$$  \n\nthe magnitude and phase angle are, respectively,  \n\n$$\n\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|=\\left|e^{-j\\omega L}\\right|\\cdot\\left|\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}\\right|=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\left/G(j\\omega)\\right.=\\;\\left.\\underline{{{\\rho}}}^{-j\\omega L}\\right.+\\;\\left.\\left/\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}=-\\omega L\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}\\omega T\\right.\n$$  \n\nSince the magnitude decreases from unity monotonically and the phase angle also decreases monotonically and indefinitely, the polar plot of the given transfer function is a spiral, as shown in Figure 7–32.  \n\nFigure 7–32 Polar plot of $e^{-j\\omega L}/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T).$  \n\nThe image depicts a complex number plotted on the Argand diagram, which is a graphical representation of complex numbers. The Argand diagram is similar to the Cartesian plane but with two dimensions for real and imaginary parts instead of one dimension for both.\n\n*   **Complex Number:**\n    *   The complex number in question is represented by the point (1 + i0).\n    *   In this case, \"i\" stands for the imaginary unit, which satisfies i^2 = -1.\n    *   This means that our complex number can also be expressed as 1 - 1i or simply 1 since multiplying and dividing by a positive real number does not change the value of a complex number.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The point representing this complex number lies on the positive x-axis.\n*   It has no imaginary component (the y-coordinate is 0).\n*   This corresponds to a purely real number, which in this context is just the number 1 itself.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{G(j\\omega)=\\frac{K\\left(1\\right.+\\left.j\\omega T_{a}\\right)\\left(1\\right.+\\left.j\\omega T_{b}\\right)\\cdots}{\\left.\\left(j\\omega\\right)^{\\lambda}\\left(1\\right.+\\left.j\\omega T_{1}\\right)\\left(1\\right.+\\left.j\\omega T_{2}\\right)\\cdots}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{\\qquad=\\frac{b_{0}(j\\omega)^{m}\\,+\\,\\,b_{1}(j\\omega)^{m-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots}{a_{0}(j\\omega)^{n}\\,+\\,\\,a_{1}(j\\omega)^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $n>m$ or the degree of the denominator polynomial is greater than that of the numerator, will have the following general shapes:  \n\n1. For $\\lambda=0$ or type 0 systems: The starting point of the polar plot (which corresponds to $\\omega\\,=\\,0$ ) is finite and is on the positive real axis. The tangent to the polar plot at $\\omega\\,=\\,0$ is perpendicular to the real axis. The terminal point, which corresponds to $\\omega=\\infty$ , is at the origin, and the curve is tangent to one of the axes.  \n\n2. For $\\lambda=1$ or type 1 systems: the $j\\omega$ term in the denominator contributes $-90^{\\circ}$ to the total phase angle of $G(j\\omega)$ for $0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\infty$ .At $\\omega=0$ , the magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ is infinity, and the phase angle becomes $-90^{\\circ}$ .At low frequencies, the polar plot is asymptotic to a line parallel to the negative imaginary axis.At $\\omega=\\infty$ , the magnitude becomes zero, and the curve converges to the origin and is tangent to one of the axes.  \n\n3. For $\\lambda\\,=\\,2$ or type 2 systems: The $(j\\omega)^{2}$ term in the denominator contributes $-180^{\\circ}$ to the total phase angle of $G(j\\omega)$ for $0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\infty$ . At $\\omega\\,=\\,0$ , the magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ is infinity, and the phase angle is equal to $-180^{\\circ}$ . At low frequencies, the polar plot may be asymptotic to the negative real axis. At $\\omega=\\infty$ , the magnitude becomes zero, and the curve is tangent to one of the axes.  \n\nThe general shapes of the low-frequency portions of the polar plots of type 0, type 1, and type 2 systems are shown in Figure 7–33. It can be seen that, if the degree of the denominator polynomial of $G(j\\omega)$ is greater than that of the numerator, then the $G(j\\omega)$ loci converge to the origin clockwise.At $\\omega=\\infty$ , the loci are tangent to one or the other axes, as shown in Figure 7–34.  \n\nThe image depicts a complex plane diagram, showcasing two systems: \"Type 1 system\" and \"Type 2 system.\" The Type 1 system is represented by a continuous loop with an infinity symbol at one end, while the Type 2 system is depicted as a straight line. The diagram includes several symbols, including ω (omega), Re (real part), Im (imaginary part), and ∞ (infinity). The background of the image is white.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Complex Plane Diagram:** The image features a complex plane diagram, which is commonly used in mathematics to visualize and analyze functions that have both real and imaginary components.\n*   **Type 1 System:** Represented by a continuous loop with an infinity symbol at one end, this system appears to be a closed curve on the complex plane.\n*   **Type 2 System:** Depicted as a straight line, this system seems to represent a linear function on the complex plane.\n*   **Symbols:** The diagram includes several symbols, including ω (omega), Re (real part), Im (imaginary part), and ∞ (infinity). These symbols are likely used to label or identify specific points or regions on the complex plane.\n*   **Background:** The background of the image is white, providing a clean and neutral backdrop for the complex plane diagram.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe image appears to be a visual representation of two systems in the context of mathematics or physics. The Type 1 system seems to represent a closed curve on the complex plane, while the Type 2 system represents a linear function. The symbols ω, Re, Im, and ∞ may indicate specific properties or characteristics of these systems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image is a complex plane diagram that illustrates two distinct systems, each with its own unique representation. The inclusion of various symbols suggests that this diagram may be used to analyze or compare the properties of these systems. Overall, the image provides a clear and concise visual representation of these mathematical concepts. 7–33 Polar plots of type 0, type 1, and type 2 systems.  \n\nThe image depicts a complex function of two variables, represented by a graph on a Cartesian coordinate system. The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Im\". The graph exhibits a symmetrical shape with respect to both axes, featuring four distinct branches or curves that extend from the origin (0, 0) in different directions.\n\nEach branch has an arrow pointing outward at its terminus, indicating the direction of increasing x-value. The branches are numbered consecutively from n=1 to n=4, starting at the bottom right and moving counterclockwise around the graph. Additionally, each branch is labeled with a specific value of m, which appears to increase by 1 as you move around the graph.\n\nThe graph also includes several mathematical expressions written in a formal script near the origin. These equations appear to define the function being plotted, but their exact meaning and relationship to the graph are unclear without additional context or information. Overall, the image presents a visually striking representation of a complex function, inviting further exploration and analysis to understand its underlying structure and behavior. 7–34 Polar plots in the high-frequency range.  \n\nNote that any complicated shapes in the polar plot curves are caused by the numerator dynamics—that is, by the time constants in the numerator of the transfer function. Figure 7–35 shows examples of polar plots of transfer functions with numerator dynamics. In analyzing control systems, the polar plot of $G(j\\omega)$ in the frequency range of interest must be accurately determined.  \n\nTable 7–1 shows sketches of polar plots of several transfer functions.  \n\nThe image displays two line graphs depicting a complex function on a complex plane. The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Im.\" Each graph contains an illustration of the real axis, the imaginary axis, and several other mathematical symbols.\n\nBoth graphs have a similar shape in the top right-hand corner of the complex plane. They are both concave up with a single peak. The point where each curve peaks is marked with an arrow pointing towards it. The arrows are labeled \"ω=∞\" on the left graph, while they appear to be labeled \"ω=0\" on the right.\n\nThe graphs share another similarity in that they both begin at 0 on the Re axis and 0 on the Im axis, before increasing. However, these similarities stop there. The curves diverge immediately after their starting points, with the left curve dipping lower into the complex plane, while the right curve rises higher up it.\n\nThe difference between the two graphs may be due to the fact that they are using different scales along each axis. If this were the case, then we could expect to see a greater spread of values on one graph than the other.\n\nAdditionally, there are differences in their position and orientation within the complex plane. The left graph appears to have been flipped 90 degrees counter-clockwise, while its right counterpart has not. 7–35 Polar plots of transfer functions with numerator dynamics.  \n\nTable 7–1 Polar Plots of Simple Transfer Functions  \n\nThe image presents a collection of 9 graphs, each illustrating various mathematical concepts. The purpose of the image is to provide visual representations of different mathematical functions and relationships.\n\nHere are the detailed descriptions for each graph:\n\n*   **Graph 1:**\n    *   A line graph with an equation written on it.\n        *   The equation is not legible due to its small size.\n        *   The graph appears to be a linear function, but the exact relationship cannot be determined without the equation.\n*   **Graph 2:**\n    *   A bar graph with multiple bars of different heights.\n        *   There are no labels or titles on this graph.\n        *   The graph seems to represent some kind of comparison or distribution, but the specific data being compared is unclear.\n*   **Graph 3:**\n    *   A pie chart with a large slice and several smaller slices.\n        *   The largest slice accounts for approximately one-quarter of the total area.\n        *   The remaining slices are much smaller, indicating that they represent relatively minor portions.\n*   **Graph 4:**\n    *   A line graph with multiple lines intersecting at different points.\n        *   There is no clear pattern or trend in these lines.\n        *   They may represent different variables or functions interacting with each other.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a variety of graphs that illustrate various mathematical concepts and relationships. While some graphs provide clear visual representations, others are unclear due to their small size or lack of labels. Overall, the image suggests an exploration of different mathematical themes and ideas.  \n\nDrawing Nyquist Plots with MATLAB. Nyquist plots, just like Bode diagrams, are commonly used in the frequency-response representation of linear, time-invariant, feedback control systems. Nyquist plots are polar plots, while Bode diagrams are rectangular plots. One plot or the other may be more convenient for a particular operation, but a given operation can always be carried out in either plot.  \n\nThe MATLAB command nyquist computes the frequency response for continuoustime, linear, time-invariant systems.When invoked without left-hand arguments, nyquist produces a Nyquist plot on the screen.  \n\nThe command nyquist(num,den)  \n\ndraws the Nyquist plot of the transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{\\operatorname{num}(s)}{\\operatorname{den}(s)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere num and den contain the polynomial coefficients in descending powers of $s$ .Other commonly used nyquist commands are  \n\nnyquist(num,den,w) nyquist(A,B,C,D) nyquist(A,B,C,D,w) nyquist(A,B,C,D,iu,w) nyquist(sys)  \n\nThe command involving the user-specified frequency vector w, such as  \n\nnyquist(num,den,w)  \n\ncalculates the frequency response at the specified frequency points in radians per second.  \n\nWhen invoked with left-hand arguments such as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{[\\mathrm{re},\\mathrm{im},\\mathrm{w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})}\\\\ &{[\\mathrm{re},\\mathrm{im},\\mathrm{w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n},\\mathsf{w})}\\\\ &{[\\mathrm{re},\\mathrm{im},\\mathrm{w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D})}\\\\ &{[\\mathrm{re},\\mathrm{im},\\mathrm{w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D},\\mathsf{w})}\\\\ &{[\\mathrm{re},\\mathrm{im},\\mathsf{w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D},\\mathsf{i u},\\mathsf{w})}\\\\ &{[\\mathrm{re},\\mathrm{im},\\mathsf{w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t}(\\mathsf{s y s})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB returns the frequency response of the system in the matrices re ,im, and w.No plot is drawn on the screen. The matrices re and im contain the real and imaginary parts of the frequency response of the system, evaluated at the frequency points specified in the vector w. Note that re and im have as many columns as outputs and one row for each element in w.  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–10 Consider the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{1}{s^{2}+0.8s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nDraw a Nyquist plot with MATLAB. Since the system is given in the form of the transfer function, the command  \n\nnyquist(num,den)  \n\nmay be used to draw a Nyquist plot. MATLAB Program 7–5 produces the Nyquist plot shown in Figure 7–36. In this plot, the ranges for the real axis and imaginary axis are automatically determined.  \n\nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program designed to generate a Nyquist plot of a given transfer function, specifically G(s) = 1/(s^2 + 0.8s - 1). The purpose of this code is to visualize and analyze the stability and characteristics of the system represented by G(s).\n\n* A MATLAB program\n\t+ The program is written in a clear and concise manner.\n\t+ It includes comments for each section, making it easy to understand.\n\t+ The use of descriptive variable names enhances readability.\n* A Nyquist plot\n\t+ The plot displays the frequency response of the system.\n\t+ It shows the magnitude and phase angle of the transfer function at various frequencies.\n\t+ The plot provides valuable information about the stability and performance of the system.\n* A legend\n\t+ The legend explains the different components of the plot.\n\t+ It indicates which lines or symbols correspond to specific parts of the system's frequency response.\n\nThe MATLAB program effectively generates a Nyquist plot that can be used to analyze the behavior of the system. By examining the plot, engineers and researchers can determine whether the system is stable and meet other design requirements.  \n\nFigure 7–36   \nNyquist plot of   \n$G(s)={\\frac{1}{s^{2}+0.8s\\,+\\,1}}.$ .  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each displaying a different aspect of mathematical concepts.

The exact nature and significance of these graphs require further context or explanation to fully understand their meaning.  \nNyquist Plot of $G(s)=1/(s^{2}+0.8s+1)$  \n\nIf we wish to draw the Nyquist plot using manually determined ranges—for example, from $^{-2}$ to 2 on the real axis and from $^{-2}$ to 2 on the imaginary axis—enter the following command into the computer:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\sf v=[-2\\mathrm{~\\bf~2~}\\cdot2\\mathrm{~\\bf~2~}\\cdot}}\\\\ {{\\sf a x i s(v);}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor, combining these two lines into one,  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{a x i s}([-2\\textit{\\textbf{2}}\\!\\cdot\\!2\\textit{\\textbf{2}}]);\n$$  \n\nSee MATLAB Program 7–6 and the resulting Nyquist plot shown in Figure 7–37.  \n\nThe image displays a code snippet for MATLAB, with the title \"MATLAB Program 7-6\" at the top. The purpose of this program is to create a plot using the Nyquist diagram.\n\n*   The first line is a comment that explains what the function does.\n    *   It reads: \"% ---------- Nyquist plot ----------\"\n*   The second line defines an anonymous function with one input argument, `s`.\n    *   This function returns the transfer function of the system, which is 1/(s^2 + 0.8s + 1).\n*   The third line plots the frequency response of the system using the `nyquist` command.\n    *   It reads: \"num = [1 0.8 1];\"\n*   The fourth line defines a vector `den` that represents the denominator of the transfer function.\n    *   It reads: \"den = [1 0.8 1];\"\n*   The fifth line plots the Nyquist plot using the `nyquist` command again.\n    *   It reads: \"v = [-2 -2 -2; axis(v)\"\n*   The sixth line displays the grid of the plot.\n    *   It reads: \"title('Nyquist Plot of G(s) = 1/(s^2 + 0.8s + 1)')\"\n\nIn summary, this code snippet creates a Nyquist diagram for a given system using MATLAB's built-in `nyquist` function. The transfer function is defined as 1/(s^2 + 0.8s + 1), and the resulting plot shows the frequency response of the system in the complex plane.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a different type of plot. The top section is labeled \"Figure 7-37\" and displays a Nyquist plot, while the bottom section shows a second Nyquist plot.\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n* **Title:** Figure 7-37\n* **Plot Type:** Nyquist Plot\n* **X-Axis:** Real Axis\n* **Y-Axis:** Imaginary Axis\n* **Data Points:** A single data point is plotted at (0, -1), indicating a phase angle of 270 degrees or π radians.\n* **Grid Lines:** The x-axis and y-axis are labeled with grid lines, providing a clear visual representation of the plot.\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n* **Plot Type:** Nyquist Plot\n* **X-Axis:** Real Axis\n* **Y-Axis:** Imaginary Axis\n* **Data Points:** A single data point is plotted at (0, -1), indicating a phase angle of 270 degrees or π radians.\n* **Grid Lines:** The x-axis and y-axis are labeled with grid lines, providing a clear visual representation of the plot.\n\n**Additional Elements:**\n\n* **Equation:** The equation \"G(s) = s^2 + 0.8s + 1\" is provided below the top section, suggesting that it may be related to the data plotted in both sections.\n* **Grid Lines:** Both plots feature grid lines on their x and y axes, which can aid in interpreting the data.\n\nIn summary, the image presents two Nyquist plots, each featuring a single data point at (0, -1). The top section includes an equation that may be relevant to the plotted data. Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the complex frequency response of a system or filter.  \n\nCaution. In drawing a Nyquist plot,where a MATLAB operation involves “Divide by zero,” the resulting Nyquist plot may have an erroneous or undesirable appearance. For example, if the transfer function $G(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{1}{s(s+1)}}\n$$  \n\nthen the MATLAB command  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathrm{num}=[1];}\\\\ {\\mathrm{den}=[1\\ \\ 1\\ \\ 0];}\\\\ {\\mathrm{nyquist}(\\mathrm{num},\\mathrm{den})}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nproduces an undesirable Nyquist plot. An example of an undesirable Nyquist plot is shown in Figure 7–38. If such an undesirable Nyquist plot appears on the computer,  \n\nThe image depicts a Nyquist diagram, a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram is set against a white background.\n\nAt the top center of the image, the title \"Nyquist Diagram\" is displayed in black text.\n\nThe x-axis and y-axis are labeled as follows:\n\n*   X-axis: \"Real Axis\"\n*   Y-axis: \"Imaginary Axis\"\n\nThe axes range from -1.4 to 0 on both the real and imaginary axes.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   A single curve traverses the entire Nyquist diagram, oscillating between positive and negative values.\n*   The curve's amplitude remains relatively constant throughout its oscillations.\n*   There are no visible asymptotes or discontinuities in the curve.\n\n**Additional Elements:**\n\n*   A dotted line is present at the center of the graph, where the real and imaginary axes intersect.\n*   A small arrowhead is attached to the right side of the curve near the origin.\n*   The image has a clean and simple design, with no additional features or decorations.\n\nOverall, the Nyquist diagram appears to be a standard representation of a system's frequency response, with no notable anomalies or unusual characteristics.  \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nFigure 7–38   \nUndesirable Nyquist plot.  \n\nthen it can be corrected if we specify the axis(v) .

It defines variables and functions to generate the plot, includes comments and labels to explain each section, and employs built-in MATLAB functions and vector operations.  \n\nNotice that the Nyquist plot shown in Figure 7–39 includes the loci for both $\\omega>0$ and $\\omega<0$ .If we wish to draw the Nyquist plot for only the positive frequency region $[\\omega>0]$ ), then we need to use the command  \n\nThe image presents a Nyquist plot of a system's frequency response, which is a graphical representation of how the system responds to different frequencies. The plot shows the magnitude and phase angle of the system's transfer function as a function of frequency.\n\n*   **Title:** \"Nyquist Plot of G(s) = 1/[s(s+1)]\"\n    *   This indicates that the system being analyzed is represented by the transfer function G(s), which has been simplified to 1/s(s+1).\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   The x-axis represents the real axis, and the y-axis represents the imaginary axis.\n    *   The magnitude of the frequency response is plotted on the radial distance from the origin, while the phase angle is plotted as an angle in radians counterclockwise from the positive real axis.\n*   **Plot:**\n    *   The plot shows a single closed loop around the origin, indicating that the system has a single pole at s = -1 and no zeros.\n    *   The magnitude of the frequency response decreases as the frequency increases, with the lowest value occurring at high frequencies (near s = j∞).\n    *   The phase angle starts at approximately 90 degrees at low frequencies (near s = 0) and approaches 0 degrees at high frequencies.\n\nOverall, the Nyquist plot suggests that the system has a single dominant pole, which causes the frequency response to roll off as the frequency increases. However, without more information about the system's behavior at very low frequencies or in the presence of external disturbances, it is difficult to draw further conclusions from this plot alone. 7–39 Nyquist plot of $G(s)={\\frac{1}{s(s+1)}}.$  \n\nA MATLAB program using this nyquist command is shown in MATLAB Program 7–8. The resulting Nyquist plot is presented in Figure 7–40.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of the Nyquist plot for a transfer function, accompanied by its corresponding MATLAB code and an annotated graph. The top section displays the MATLAB code in a box, while the bottom section features a graph with annotations.\n\n*   **MATLAB Code**\n    *   The code defines a function to generate the Nyquist plot of a given transfer function.\n    *   It utilizes the `nyquist` command from the Control Systems Toolbox to create the plot.\n    *   The code includes input and output arguments, as well as optional parameters for customizing the plot.\n*   **Nyquist Plot**\n    *   The graph shows the Nyquist plot of a transfer function on an Argand diagram.\n    *   The plot consists of a semicircle in the left half-plane, which is enclosed by a circle centered at the origin with radius 1.\n    *   The circle represents the unit circle, and the semicircle inside it represents the region where the phase angle of the transfer function lies between -180° and 0°.\n*   **Annotations**\n    *   The graph includes annotations to highlight key features of the Nyquist plot.\n    *   A dashed line indicates the unit circle, while a solid line represents the semicircle inside it.\n    *   An arrow points to the origin (0+0j), and another arrow points to the point where the semicircle intersects the real axis (-1+0j).\n*   **Transfer Function**\n    *   The transfer function is represented as G(s) = 1/s(s+1), which can be rewritten in terms of s by multiplying both sides by s.\n    *   This results in a first-order system with one pole at the origin and one zero at -1.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a detailed analysis of the Nyquist plot for a transfer function G(s) = 1/s(s+1), along with its corresponding MATLAB code. The graph shows the semicircle in the left half-plane, enclosed by the unit circle, and includes annotations to highlight key features of the plot.  \n\nDrawing Nyquist Plots of a System Defined in State Space.

The command  \n\nproduces Nyquist plots from the single input iu to all the outputs of the system, with the frequency range determined automatically.The scalar iu is an index into the inputs of the system and specifies which input to use for the frequency response.  \n\nThe command  \n\nuses the user-supplied frequency vector w. The vector wspecifies the frequencies in radians per second at which the frequency response should be calculated.  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–12 Consider the system defined by  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{{\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}={\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l l}{\\;~~0}&{1{\\displaystyle\\prod_{-25}}x_{1}{\\\\\\ {-25}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}{\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}+{\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {25}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}u}\\\\ {y={\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{0{\\displaystyle\\right]}{\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}+\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}u}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nDraw a Nyquist plot.  \n\nThis system has a single input $u$ and a single output $y_{\\cdot}$ . A Nyquist plot may be obtained by entering the command  \n\nor  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–9 will provide the Nyquist plot. (Note that we obtain the identical result by using either of these two commands.) Figure 7–41 shows the Nyquist plot produced by MATLAB Program 7–9.  \n\nThe image shows a code snippet for a MATLAB program, specifically designed to create a Nyquist plot. The code is written in black text on a white background and consists of three lines:\n\n*   `A = [0 1;-25 -4];`\n*   `B = [0;25];`\n*   `C = [1 0];`\n\nThese lines define the coefficients of two polynomials, which are used to create a Nyquist plot. The Nyquist plot is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system, specifically designed to analyze the stability and behavior of control systems.\n\nThe code snippet provided generates the coefficients for the following polynomials:\n\n*   `A = [0 1;-25 -4];`: This represents the polynomial $a(s) = s^2 + (-4)s - 25$.\n*   `B = [0;25];`: This represents the polynomial $b(s) = s^2 + 25s$.\n*   `C = [1 0];`: This represents the polynomial $c(s) = s + 1$.\n\nThese polynomials are then used to create a Nyquist plot, which can be used to analyze the stability and behavior of control systems. The plot shows the frequency response of the system, with the x-axis representing the frequency and the y-axis representing the magnitude of the transfer function. The Nyquist plot is an important tool in control theory, as it allows engineers to visualize and understand the behavior of complex systems.\n\nOverall, the code snippet provided generates the coefficients for two polynomials, which are then used to create a Nyquist plot.

There are four sinusoidal output–input relationships: $Y_{1}(j\\omega)/U_{1}(j\\omega),\\,Y_{2}(j\\omega)/U_{1}(j\\omega),\\,Y_{1}(j\\omega)/U_{2}(j\\omega)$ and $Y_{2}(j\\omega)/U_{2}(j\\omega)$ .Draw Nyquist plots for the system. (When considering input $u_{1}$ , we assume that input $u_{2}$ is zero, and vice versa.)  \n\nThe four individual Nyquist plots can be obtained by the use of the command MATLAB Program 7–10 produces the four Nyquist plots.They are shown in Figure 7–42.  \n\nThis image is a code snippet from a MATLAB program. The code defines three variables: A, B, and C, which are initialized with values of -1, 6.5, and 1 respectively. Additionally, it defines variable D as an array containing zero values.\n\nThe image presents the code in a clear and organized manner, using proper formatting to facilitate readability. The use of descriptive variable names enhances the clarity of the code.  \n\nThe image presents a Nyquist plot system, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a control system.

If the plot encircles the point (-1, j0) in the complex plane, the system is unstable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image provides a clear visual representation of the frequency response of a control system, allowing for easy analysis and interpretation of its stability. By examining the magnitude and phase angle of the transfer function at different frequencies, engineers can determine whether the system is stable or not.  \n\n# 7–4 LOG-MAGNITUDE-VERSUS-PHASE PLOTS  \n\nAnother approach to graphically portraying the frequency-response characteristics is to use the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot, which is a plot of the logarithmic magnitude in decibels versus the phase angle or phase margin for a frequency range of interest. [The phase margin is the difference between the actual phase angle $\\phi$ and $-180^{\\circ}$ ; that is, $\\phi\\,-\\,\\left(-180^{\\circ}\\right)\\,=\\,180^{\\circ}\\,+\\,\\phi.]$ The curve is graduated in terms of the frequency $\\omega$ . Such log-magnitude-versus-phase plots are commonly called Nichols plots.  \n\nIn the Bode diagram, the frequency-response characteristics of $G(j\\omega)$ are shown on semilog paper by two separate curves, the log-magnitude curve and the phase-angle curve, while in the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot, the two curves in the Bode diagram are combined into one. In the manual approach the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot can easily be constructed by reading values of the log magnitude and phase angle from the Bode diagram. Notice that in the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot a change in the gain constant of $G(j\\omega)$ merely shifts the curve up (for increasing gain) or down (for decreasing gain), but the shape of the curve remains the same.  \n\nAdvantages of the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot are that the relative stability of the closed-loop system can be determined quickly and that compensation can be worked out easily.  \n\nThe log-magnitude-versus-phase plot for the sinusoidal transfer function $G(j\\omega)$ and that for $1/G(j\\omega)$ are skew symmetrical about the origin, since  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{1}{G(j\\omega)}\\right|\\mathrm{in\\,dB}=-\\bigl|G(j\\omega)\\bigr|\\,\\mathrm{in\\,dB}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents three graphs, labeled (a), (b), and (c), each displaying a distinct relationship between variables. The graphs are arranged in a column, with graph (a) at the top, followed by graphs (b) and (c).\n\n**Graph (a)**\n\n*   This graph features two curves: one for |G| dB vs ωn and another for Δφ vs ωn.\n*   The x-axis represents ωn, while the y-axis is divided into two sections: the left side displays |G| in dB, and the right side shows Δφ.\n*   The top curve illustrates a peak in |G| at approximately 0.5, with values decreasing as ωn increases beyond this point.\n*   The lower curve exhibits a gradual increase in Δφ as ωn approaches 1.\n\n**Graph (b)**\n\n*   This graph consists of two curves: one for Re(G) vs ωn and another for M_r vs ωn.\n*   The x-axis represents ωn, while the y-axis is divided into two sections: the left side displays Re(G), and the right side shows M_r.\n*   The top curve reveals a peak in Re(G) at approximately 0.5, with values decreasing as ωn increases beyond this point.\n*   The lower curve exhibits a gradual increase in M_r as ωn approaches 1.\n\n**Graph (c)**\n\n*   This graph features two curves: one for |G| in dB vs ω and another for Δφ vs ω.\n*   The x-axis represents ω, while the y-axis is divided into two sections: the left side displays |G| in dB, and the right side shows Δφ.\n*   The top curve illustrates a peak in |G| at approximately 0.5, with values decreasing as ω increases beyond this point.\n*   The lower curve exhibits a gradual increase in Δφ as ω approaches 1.\n\nIn summary, the three graphs display relationships between variables such as |G| dB vs ωn and Δφ vs ωn. The top graph shows peaks in both |G| and Δφ at approximately 0.5, while the middle graph reveals a peak in Re(G) and an increase in M_r at similar values of ωn. The bottom graph illustrates a peak in |G| and an increase in Δφ as ω approaches 1. 7–43  \n\nThree representations of the frequency response of $\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\!\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\right)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\right)^{2}}$ ,for $\\zeta>0$ .  \n\n(a) Bode diagram; (b) polar plot; (c) log-magnitude-versus-phase plot.  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\left/\\frac{1}{G(j\\omega)}=-\\big/G(j\\omega)\\right.\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–43 compares frequency-response curves of  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\bigg)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}\\right)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nin three different representations. In the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot, the vertical distance between the points $\\omega=0$ and $\\omega=\\omega_{r}$ ,where $\\omega_{r}$ is the resonant frequency,is the peak value of $G(j\\omega)$ in decibels.  \n\nSince log-magnitude and phase-angle characteristics of basic transfer functions have been discussed in detail in Sections 7–2 and 7–3, it will be sufficient here to give examples of some log-magnitude-versus-phase plots.Table 7–2 shows such examples. (However, more on Nichols charts will be discussed in Section 7–6.)  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive collection of six graphs, each illustrating distinct mathematical relationships. The top-left graph displays a line chart with a single peak at 1 on both axes, accompanied by an equation G = 1/jω.\n\nMoving clockwise from this initial graph, we encounter three more line charts. These charts feature various functions of ω, including:\n\n*   G = (jω)^2 + 1\n*   G = e^(-jωL)\n*   G = jω(1+jωT)\n\nThe bottom-left graph is a parabola chart with a single peak at approximately -10 on the y-axis and -4 on the x-axis. This chart illustrates the function:\n\nG = (jω)^2 + 1\n\nThe final graph, situated in the lower right corner of the image, appears to be a line chart with no discernible peaks or troughs. Unfortunately, its equation is not legible.\n\nOverall, the image provides a diverse range of mathematical relationships and functions, showcasing different types of charts and equations.  \n\n# 7–5 NYQUIST STABILITY CRITERION  \n\nThe Nyquist stability criterion determines the stability of a closed-loop system from its open-loop frequency response and open-loop poles.  \n\nThis section presents mathematical background for understanding the Nyquist stability criterion. Consider the closed-loop system shown in Figure 7–44.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–44 Closed-loop system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising three primary components: R(s), G(s), and C(s). The system is designed to regulate the output signal by manipulating the input signal.\n\n*   **R(s) (Reference Input)**:\n    *   Located on the left side of the diagram.\n    *   Represents the reference input or setpoint for the system.\n    *   Its purpose is to provide a desired value that the system aims to track.\n*   **G(s) (Controller Transfer Function)**:\n    *   Positioned in the middle of the diagram.\n    *   Denotes the transfer function of the controller, which processes the error signal.\n    *   The controller's goal is to generate an appropriate control action based on the difference between the reference input and actual output.\n*   **C(s) (Plant or Process)**:\n    *   Situated on the right side of the diagram.\n    *   Represents the plant or process being controlled, which responds to the control action from the controller.\n    *   The plant's response is influenced by its own dynamics and characteristics.\n\nIn summary, this block diagram illustrates a closed-loop control system where the controller (G(s)) continuously monitors the difference between the reference input (R(s)) and actual output (C(s)), generating a corrective signal to adjust the process accordingly. This setup enables the system to achieve stable operation and track desired values effectively.  \n\nFor stability, all roots of the characteristic equation  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nmust lie in the left-half $s$ plane.[It is noted that,although poles and zeros of the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ may be in the right-half $s$ plane, the system is stable if all the poles of the closed-loop transfer function (that is, the roots of the characteristic equation) are in the left-half $s$ plane.] The Nyquist stability criterion relates the open-loop frequency response $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ to the number of zeros and poles of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ that lie in the right-half $s$ plane.This criterion,derived by H.Nyquist,is useful in control engineering because the absolute stability of the closed-loop system can be determined graphically from open-loop frequency-response curves, and there is no need for actually determining the closed-loop poles. Analytically obtained open-loop frequency-response curves, as well as those experimentally obtained,can be used for the stability analysis.This is convenient because, in designing a control system, it often happens that mathematical expressions for some of the components are not known; only their frequency-response data are available.  \n\nThe Nyquist stability criterion is based on a theorem from the theory of complex variables.To understand the criterion, we shall first discuss mappings of contours in the complex plane.  \n\nWe shall assume that the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ is representable as a ratio of polynomials in $s.$ . For a physically realizable system, the degree of the denominator polynomial of the closed-loop transfer function must be greater than or equal to that of the numerator polynomial.This means that the limit of $G(s)H(s)$ as $s$ approaches infinity is zero or a constant for any physically realizable system.  \n\nPreliminary Study. The characteristic equation of the system shown in Figure 7–44 is  \n\n$$\nF(s)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nWe shall show that, for a given continuous closed path in the $s$ plane that does not go through any singular points, there corresponds a closed curve in the $F(s)$ plane. The number and direction of encirclements of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane by the closed curve play a particularly important role in what follows, for later we shall correlate the number and direction of encirclements with the stability of the system.  \n\nConsider, for example, the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)=\\frac{2}{s-1}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{F(s)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{=\\,1\\,+\\,{\\frac{2}{s\\,-\\,1}}={\\frac{s\\,+\\,1}{s\\,-\\,1}}=0}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a graph of two complex numbers, represented by their real and imaginary parts on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. The graph shows the relationship between these two complex numbers.\n\n*   **Complex Number 1**\n    *   Located at point (0, j2)\n    *   Real part: 0\n    *   Imaginary part: 2j\n*   **Complex Number 2**\n    *   Located at point (-1, -j1)\n    *   Real part: -1\n    *   Imaginary part: -j1\n\nThe graph also includes a line that represents the relationship between these two complex numbers. The line passes through the points (0, j2) and (-1, -j1).\n\n*   **Line**\n    *   Passes through points (0, j2) and (-1, -j1)\n    *   Represents the relationship between the two complex numbers\n\nOverall, the graph provides a visual representation of the relationship between two complex numbers. 7–45 Conformal mapping of the $s$ -plane grids into the $F(s)$ plane, where $\\bar{F}(s)\\,=\\,(s\\,+\\,1)/(s\\,-\\,1).$  \n\nThe image depicts a complex number plane, with real and imaginary axes intersecting at the origin. The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" (real part) and ranges from -3 to 4, while the y-axis is labeled \"Im\" (imaginary part) and ranges from -2 to 3.\n\nSeveral key features are visible in the image:\n\n*   **Origin**: The point where the real and imaginary axes intersect, marked as \"(0,0)\".\n*   **Axes Labels**: The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" and the y-axis is labeled \"Im\".\n*   **Axis Range**: The x-axis ranges from -3 to 4, while the y-axis ranges from -2 to 3.\n*   **Circle Arrows**: Arrows pointing to the left indicate negative values on the real axis, while arrows pointing up indicate positive values on the imaginary axis.\n*   **Complex Number Representation**: Complex numbers are represented as points in the plane, with the real part on the x-axis and the imaginary part on the y-axis.\n\nOverall, the image provides a clear visual representation of the complex number plane, highlighting key features such as the origin, axis labels, and circle arrows.  \n\nThe function $F(s)$ is analytic #everywhere in the $s$ plane except at its singular points. For each point of analyticity in the $s$ plane, there corresponds a point in the $F(s)$ plane. For example, if $s\\,=\\,2\\,+\\,j1$ , then $F(s)$ becomes  \n\n$$\nF(2\\,+\\,j1)=\\frac{2\\,+\\,j1\\,+\\,1}{2\\,+\\,j1\\,-\\,1}=2\\,-\\,j1\n$$  \n\nThus, point $s\\,=\\,2\\,+\\,j1$ in the $s$ plane maps into point $2\\mathrm{~-~}j1$ in the $F(s)$ plane.  \n\nThus,as stated previously,for a given continuous closed path in the $s$ plane,which does not go through any singular points, there corresponds a closed curve in the $F(s)$ plane.  \n\nFor the characteristic equation $F(s)$ given by Equation (7–15), the conformal mapping of the lines $\\omega=0,\\pm1,\\pm2$ and the lines $\\sigma=0,\\pm{1},\\pm{2}$ [see Figure 7–45(a)] yield circles in the $F(s)$ plane, as shown in Figure 7–45(b). Suppose that representative point $s$ traces out a contour in the $s$ plane in the clockwise direction. If the contour in the $s$ plane encloses the pole of $F(s)$ , there is one encirclement of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane by the locus of $F(s)$ in the counterclockwise direction. [See Figure 7–46(a).] If the contour in the $s$ plane encloses the zero of $F(s)$ ,there is one encirclement of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane by the locus of $F(s)$ in the clockwise direction. [See Figure 7–46(b).] If the contour in the $s$ plane encloses both the zero and the pole or if the contour encloses neither the zero nor the pole, then there is no encirclement of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane by the locus of $F(s)$ .[See Figures 7–46(c) and (d).]  \n\nFrom the foregoing analysis, we can say that the direction of encirclement of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane by the locus of $F(s)$ depends on whether the contour in the $s$ plane encloses a pole or a zero. Note that the location of a pole or zero in the $s$ plane, whether in the right-half or left-half $s$ plane, does not make any difference, but the enclosure of a pole or zero does. If the contour in the $s$ plane encloses equal numbers of poles and zeros, then the corresponding closed curve in the $F(s)$ plane does not encircle the origin of the $F(s)$ plane.The foregoing discussion is a graphical explanation of the mapping theorem, which is the basis for the Nyquist stability criterion.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of four mathematical diagrams, each comprising two parts: a rectangular graph and its corresponding polar coordinate plot. The graphs are arranged in a 2x2 grid, with the top-left diagram labeled as (a) and the bottom-right diagram labeled as (d). \n\nEach pair consists of a rectangle on the left and a circular representation on the right, showcasing different mathematical concepts.\n\nThe first graph (a) illustrates an equation involving complex numbers. It features two rectangles: one containing the real part of a complex number, ranging from -1 to 2 on the x-axis, and another representing its imaginary part, spanning from -j1 to j2 on the y-axis. The corresponding circular representation displays a closed loop, indicating that the function is periodic.\n\nThe second graph (b) depicts an equation with complex numbers as variables. It comprises two rectangles: one covering the real part of the variable z, ranging from -1 to 0 on the x-axis, and another for its imaginary part, spanning from 0 to j1 on the y-axis. The corresponding circular representation exhibits a closed loop, signifying periodicity.\n\nThe third graph (c) represents an equation with complex numbers as variables. It comprises two rectangles: one covering the real part of the variable z, ranging from -j1 to 2 on the x-axis, and another for its imaginary part, spanning from -1 to j1 on the y-axis. The corresponding circular representation displays a closed loop, indicating periodicity.\n\nThe fourth graph (d) illustrates an equation with complex numbers as variables. It comprises two rectangles: one covering the real part of the variable z, ranging from -j2 to 2 on the x-axis, and another for its imaginary part, spanning from -1 to j1 on the y-axis. The corresponding circular representation exhibits a closed loop, signifying periodicity.\n\nIn summary, these diagrams provide a visual representation of mathematical concepts involving complex numbers and their geometric interpretations in both rectangular and polar coordinate systems. 7–46 Closed contours in the $s$ plane and their corresponding closed curves in the $F(s)$ plane, where $F(s)\\,=\\,(s\\,+\\,1)/(s\\,-\\,1)$ .  \n\nMapping Theorem. Let $F(s)$ be a ratio of two polynomials in $s.$ . Let $P$ be the number of poles and $Z$ be the number of zeros of $F(s)$ that lie inside some closed contour in the $s$ plane, with multiplicity of poles and zeros accounted for. Let the contour be such that it does not pass through any poles or zeros of $F(s)$ .This closed contour in the $s$ plane is then mapped into the $F(s)$ plane as a closed curve. The total number $N$ of clockwise encirclements of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane, as a representative point $s$ traces out the entire contour in the clockwise direction, is equal to $Z\\mathrm{~-~}P$ . (Note that by this mapping theorem, the numbers of zeros and of poles cannot be found—only their difference.)  \n\nWe shall not present a formal proof of this theorem here, but leave the proof to Problem A–7–6 . Note that a positive number $N$ indicates an excess of zeros over poles of the function $F(s)$ and a negative $N$ indicates an excess of poles over zeros. In control system applications, the number $P$ can be readily determined for $F(s)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ from the function $G(s)H(s)$ . Therefore, if $N$ is determined from the plot of $F(s)$ , the number of zeros in the closed contour in the $s$ plane can be determined readily.Note that the exact shapes of the $s$ -plane contour and $F(s)$ locus are immaterial so far as encirclements of the origin are concerned, since encirclements depend only on the enclosure of poles and/or zeros of $F(s)$ by the $s$ -plane contour.  \n\nApplication of the Mapping Theorem to the Stability Analysis of Closed-Loop Systems. For analyzing the stability of linear control systems, we let the closed contour in the $s$ plane enclose the entire right-half $s$ plane.The contour consists of the entire $j\\omega$ axis from $\\omega=-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ and a semicircular path of infinite radius in the right-half $s$ plane. Such a contour is called the Nyquist path. (The direction of the path is clockwise.) The Nyquist path encloses the entire right-half $s$ plane and encloses all the zeros and poles of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ that have positive real parts. [If there are no zeros of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane, then there are no closed-loop poles there, and the system is stable.] It is necessary that the closed contour, or the Nyquist path, not pass through any zeros and poles of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s).$ . If $G(s)H(s)$ has a pole or poles at the origin of the $s$ plane, mapping of the point $s\\,=\\,0$ becomes indeterminate. In such cases, the origin is avoided by taking a detour around it. (A detailed discussion of this special case is given later.)  \n\nIf the mapping theorem is applied to the special case in which $F(s)$ is equal to $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ , then we can make the following statement: If the closed contour in the $s$ plane encloses the entire right-half $s$ plane, as shown in Figure 7–47, then the number of right-half plane zeros of the function $F(s)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ is equal to the number of poles of the function $F(s)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane plus the number of clockwise encirclements of the origin of the $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ plane by the corresponding closed curve in this latter plane.  \n\nBecause of the assumed condition that  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to\\infty}\\bigl[1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)\\bigr]\\,=\\,\\mathrm{constant}\n$$  \n\nthe function of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ remains constant as $s$ traverses the semicircle of infinite radius. Because of this, whether the locus of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ encircles the origin of the $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ plane can be determined by considering only a part of the closed contour in the $s$ plane—that is,the $j\\omega$ axis.Encirclements of the origin,if there are any,occur only while a representative point moves from $-j\\infty$ to $+j\\infty$ along the jvaxis, provided that no zeros or poles lie on the $j\\omega$ axis.  \n\nThe image presents a graphical representation of a mathematical concept, likely related to complex analysis or signal processing. The central element is a semicircular arc with its center at the origin (0, 0) and extending infinitely in both directions along the x-axis.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Semicircular Arc:** The arc is positioned on the right half of the complex plane, with one end meeting the positive real axis at infinity.\n    *   Radius: Infinite\n    *   Orientation: Rightward\n*   **Axes:** Two axes are visible in the diagram:\n    *   Real Axis (x-axis): Extends from negative to positive infinity along the x-axis.\n        *   Origin: (0, 0)\n        *   Endpoints: -∞ and +∞\n    *   Imaginary Axis (y-axis): Not directly shown but implied by the semicircular arc.\n*   **Labels:** The diagram includes labels for the real and imaginary axes:\n    *   Real Axis: \"jω\" ( likely a typo or representation error, as it should be \"x\")\n    *   Imaginary Axis: Not explicitly labeled\n*   **Symbolism:** An arrow points from the origin towards the semicircular arc. This may indicate directionality or flow in the context of complex analysis.\n\n**Interpretation and Context:**\n\nThe image appears to represent a mathematical concept related to signal processing or Fourier transforms, given the presence of the \"jω\" label on the real axis. However, without additional context or explanation, it is challenging to provide a precise interpretation of this diagram. It seems to illustrate how signals can be represented in the frequency domain using complex numbers, with the semicircular arc potentially symbolizing the spectrum of frequencies. 7–47 Closed contour in the $s$ plane.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of mathematical equations and graphs, likely related to complex analysis or signal processing. The content is organized into three main sections:\n\n*   **Equations**\n    *   The first equation is:\n\n        $H(j\\omega) = G(j\\omega) \\cdot H(j\\omega)$\n    *   The second equation is:\n\n        $H(j\\omega) = G(j\\omega) + 1$\n    *   The third equation is:\n\n        $H(j\\omega) = G(j\\omega) \\cdot (j\\omega)^{-1}$\n*   **Graphs**\n    *   There are two graphs, each with a different function or transformation applied to the input signal.\n    *   The top graph shows a plot of the magnitude response of a filter, with the x-axis representing frequency and the y-axis representing amplitude.\n    *   The bottom graph shows a plot of the phase response of a filter, with the x-axis representing frequency and the y-axis representing phase angle.\n*   **Other Elements**\n    *   There are several other elements in the image that appear to be related to the equations and graphs. These include:\n        *   An arrow pointing to the top graph, labeled \"Im\" (imaginary axis).\n        *   A line connecting the two graphs, labeled \"Re\" (real axis).\n        *   A symbol resembling a \"U\" or an upside-down \"V\", possibly representing a transfer function or impedance.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be showing how different transformations and operations can be applied to signals in order to analyze their frequency domain properties. The use of complex numbers and trigonometric functions suggests that the analysis is focused on linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, which are commonly used in signal processing applications. 7–48 Plots of $1\\,+\\,G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ in the $1\\,+\\,G H$ plane and $G H$ plane.  \n\nNote that the portion of the $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ contour from $\\omega=-\\infty$ to $\\omega=\\infty$ is simply $1\\,+\\,G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ . Since $1\\,+\\,G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ is the vector sum of the unit vector and the vector $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega),1\\,+\\,G(j\\omega)H(\\mathrm{j}\\omega)$ is identical to the vector drawn from the $-1+j0$ point to the terminal point of the vector $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ , as shown in Figure 7–48. Encirclement of the origin by the graph of $1\\,+\\,G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ is equivalent to encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point by just the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus.Thus,the stability of a closedloop system can be investigated by examining encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point by the locus of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ .The number of clockwise encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point can be found by drawing a vector from the $-1+j0$ point to the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus, starting from $\\omega=-\\infty$ , going through $\\omega=0$ , and ending at $\\omega=+\\infty$ , and by counting the number of clockwise rotations of the vector.  \n\nPlotting $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ for the Nyquist path is straightforward.The map of the negative $j\\omega$ axis is the mirror image about the real axis of the map of the positive $j\\omega$ axis.That is, the plot of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ and the plot of $G(-j\\omega)H(-j\\omega)$ are symmetrical with each other about the real axis.The semicircle with infinite radius maps into either the origin of the $G H$ plane or a point on the real axis of the $G H$ plane.  \n\nIn the preceding discussion, $G(s)H(s)$ has been assumed to be the ratio of two polynomials in $s$ . Thus, the transport lag $e^{-T s}$ has been excluded from the discussion. Note, however, that a similar discussion applies to systems with transport lag, although a proof of this is not given here.The stability of a system with transport lag can be determined from the open-loop frequency-response curves by examining the number of encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point, just as in the case of a system whose open-loop transfer function is a ratio of two polynomials in $s$ .  \n\nNyquist Stability Criterion. The foregoing analysis, utilizing the encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point by the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus, is summarized in the following Nyquist stability criterion:  \n\nNyquist stability criterion [for a special case when $G(s)H(s)$ has neither poles nor zeros on the jvaxis ]:In the system shown in Figure 7–44,if the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ has $k$ poles in the right-half $s$ plane and $\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\infty}G(s)H(s)=$ constant ,then for stability,the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus,as $\\omega$ varies from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ ,must encircle the $-1+j0$ point $k$ times in the counterclockwise direction.  \n\n# Remarks on the Nyquist Stability Criterion  \n\n1. This criterion can be expressed as  \n\n$$\nZ=N+P\n$$  \n\nwhere $Z=$ number of zeros of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane $N=$ number of clockwise encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point $P=$ number of poles of $G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane  \n\nIf $P$ is not zero,for a stable control system,we must have $Z=0$ ,or $N=-P$ ,which means that we must have $P$ counterclockwise encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point.  \n\nIf $G(s)H(s)$ does not have any poles in the right-half $s$ plane, then $Z\\,=\\,N$ .Thus, for stability there must be no encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point by the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus. In this case it is not necessary to consider the locus for the entire $j\\omega$ axis, only for the positive-frequency portion.The stability of such a system can be determined by seeing if the $-1+j0$ point is enclosed by the Nyquist plot of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ .The region enclosed by the Nyquist plot is shown in Figure 7–49. For stability, the $-1+j0$ point must lie outside the shaded region.  \n\n2. We must be careful when testing the stability of multiple-loop systems since they may include poles in the right-half $s$ plane. (Note that although an inner loop may be unstable, the entire closed-loop system can be made stable by proper design.) Simple inspection of encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point by the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus is not sufficient to detect instability in multiple-loop systems. In such cases, however, whether any pole of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ is in the right-half $s$ plane can be determined easily by applying the Routh stability criterion to the denominator of $G(s)H(s)$ .  \n\nIf transcendental functions,such as transport lag $e^{-T s}$ ,are included in $G(s)H(s)$ ,they must be approximated by a series expansion before the Routh stability criterion can be applied.  \n\n3. If the locus of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ passes through the $-1+j0$ point, then zeros of the characteristic equation, or closed-loop poles, are located on the $j\\omega$ axis.This is not desirable for practical control systems. For a well-designed closed-loop system, none of the roots of the characteristic equation should lie on the $j\\omega$ axis.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"Im\" and \"Re,\" which are likely representing imaginary and real components of a complex number. The graph features a single curve that is partially visible within the depicted range.\n\n*   The x-axis (Re) spans from -1 to 0.\n*   The y-axis (Im) extends from approximately -5 to 2.\n*   A vertical line intersects both axes at the origin (0,0), dividing the graph into two sections: one above and to the left of the origin, and another below and to the right.\n*   Within this range, a portion of a curve is visible, characterized by a negative slope in the upper-left section and a positive slope in the lower-right section.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe image displays a partial view of a graph with two axes representing real and imaginary components. A single curve intersects both axes at the origin, exhibiting distinct slopes above and below it within the visible range. 7–49 Region enclosed by a Nyquist plot.  \n\nSpecial Case when $G(s)H(s)$ Involves Poles and /or Zeros on the jVAxis. In the previous discussion, we assumed that the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ has neither poles nor zeros at the origin.We now consider the case where $G(s)H(s)$ involves poles and/or zeros on the $j\\omega$ axis.  \n\nSince the Nyquist path must not pass through poles or zeros of $G(s)H(s)$ , if the function $G(s)H(s)$ has poles or zeros at the origin (or on the $j\\omega$ axis at points other than the origin), the contour in the $s$ plane must be modified. The usual way of modifying the contour near the origin is to use a semicircle with the infinitesimal radius $\\varepsilon$ , as shown in Figure 7–50. [Note that this semicircle may lie in the right-half $s$ plane or in the left-half $s$ plane. Here we take the semicircle in the right-half $s$ plane.] A representative point $s$ moves along the negative $j\\omega$ axis from $-j\\infty$ to $j0-$ .From $s\\,=\\,j0-$ to $s\\,=\\,j0+$ ,the point moves along the semicircle of radius $\\varepsilon$ (where $\\varepsilon\\ll1$ )and then moves along the positive $j\\omega$ axis from $j0+$ to $j\\infty.$ . From $s=j\\infty$ , the contour follows a semicircle with infinite radius, and the representative point moves back to the starting point, $s=-j\\infty.$ The area that the modified closed contour avoids is very small and approaches zero as the radius $\\varepsilon$ approaches zero.Therefore, all the poles and zeros, if any, in the right-half $s$ plane are enclosed by this contour.  \n\nConsider, for example, a closed-loop system whose open-loop transfer function is given by  \n\nThe image presents two semicircles, each with a radius of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ centered on the real axis at points $-1$ and $1$. The left semicircle is positioned above the x-axis, while the right semicircle is situated below it. These semicircles are symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nThe image also features two half-circles. The top half-circle lies directly above the left semicircle and has a radius of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The bottom half-circle is located below the right semicircle, also with a radius of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nIn addition to these geometric shapes, there are several lines present in the image. These lines connect various points on the graph and serve as labels for specific values or intervals. For example, one line connects the origin (0, 0) to the point $(1, \\frac{3\\pi}{4})$, while another line runs from $(-1, -\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ to $(1, \\frac{3\\pi}{4})$. Additionally, there are vertical and horizontal lines that intersect with other curves in the graph.\n\nFinally, the image includes some text elements. In the top-left corner, it says \"s Plane\" in small letters. Similarly, in the bottom-right corner, it reads \"jw Plane\". These labels likely refer to the coordinate systems used for plotting the various functions and curves shown in the graph.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be a mathematical diagram illustrating different geometric shapes and relationships between them. The use of semicircles, half-circles, lines, and text elements creates a complex visual representation that may be related to advanced mathematical concepts or theories. 7–50 Contour near the origin of the $s$ plane and closed contour in the $s$ plane avoiding poles and zeros at the origin.  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\frac{K}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThe points corresponding to $s\\,=\\,j0+$ and $s\\,=\\,j0-$ on the locus of $G(s)H(s)$ in the $G(s)H(s)$ plane are $-j\\infty$ and $j\\infty$ , respectively.

The content is organized into distinct sections, each addressing specific aspects of complex numbers.\n\n*   **Complex Numbers**\n    *   Complex numbers are represented using the notation $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.\n    *   The magnitude or modulus of a complex number $|z|$ is given by $\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.\n    *   The argument or angle of a complex number is denoted as Arg($z$) and represents the counterclockwise angle from the positive real axis to the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane.\n*   **Polar Form**\n    *   A complex number can be expressed in polar form using its magnitude $r = |z|$ and argument $\\theta = \\text{Arg}(z)$ as $z = re^{i\\theta}$, where $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$.\n    *   The polar form is useful for representing complex numbers in a more intuitive and visual manner, especially when dealing with rotations or phases in electrical engineering applications.\n*   **Complex Conjugate**\n    *   The complex conjugate of $z = x + yi$ is denoted as $\\bar{z} = x - yi$, where the sign of the imaginary part is reversed.\n    *   The product of a complex number and its conjugate results in the square of its magnitude: $zz^* = (x + yi)(x - yi) = x^2 + y^2$.\n*   **Argument Principle**\n    *   The argument principle states that if $f(z)$ is analytic within and on a simple closed contour $C$, then $\\int_C \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = 2\\pi i$. This formula relates the integral of a function over a closed curve to its poles inside the curve.\n    *   The argument principle has significant implications in complex analysis, particularly in the study of singularities and their behavior within a region bounded by a closed contour.\n\nIn summary, the image provides an overview of fundamental concepts related to complex numbers, including their representation, properties, and applications. By understanding these principles, one can effectively analyze and manipulate complex functions, which is crucial in various fields such as electrical engineering and physics. 7–51 $s$ -Plane contour and the $G(s)H(s)$ locus in the $G H$ plane, where $\\dot{G}(s)H(s)\\,=\\,K/\\bigl[s(T s\\,+\\,1)\\bigr].$ .  \n\nThe value $K/\\varepsilon$ approaches infinity as $\\varepsilon$ approaches zero, and $-\\theta$ varies from $90^{\\circ}$ to $-90^{\\circ}$ as a representative point $s$ moves along the semicircle in the $s$ plane. Thus, the points $G(j0-)H(j0-)=j\\infty$ and $G(j0{+})H(j0{+})\\,=\\,-j\\infty$ are joined by a semicircle of infinite radius in the right-half $G H$ plane.The infinitesimal semicircular detour around the origin in the $s$ plane maps into the $G H$ plane as a semicircle of infinite radius. Figure 7–51 shows the $s$ -plane contour and the $G(s)H(s)$ locus in the $G H$ plane. Points $A,B$ , and $C$ on the $s$ -plane contour map into the respective points $A^{\\prime},B^{\\prime}$ , and $C^{\\prime}$ on the $G(s)H(s)$ locus.As seen from Figure 7–51, points $D,E$ , and $F$ on the semicircle of infinite radius in the $s$ plane map into the origin of the $G H$ plane. Since there is no pole in the righthalf $s$ plane and the $G(s)H(s)$ locus does not encircle the $-1+j0$ point, there are no zeros of the function $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane. Therefore, the system is stable.  \n\nFor an open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ involving a $1/s^{n}$ factor (where $n=2,3,\\dots)$ ), the plot of $G(s)H(s)$ has $n$ clockwise semicircles of infinite radius about the origin as a representative point $s$ moves along the semicircle of radius $\\varepsilon$ (where $\\varepsilon\\ll1$ ). For example, consider the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{K}{s^{2}(T s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow\\varepsilon e^{j\\theta}}G(s)H(s)={\\frac{K}{\\varepsilon^{2}e^{2j\\theta}}}={\\frac{K}{\\varepsilon^{2}}}\\,e^{-2j\\theta}\n$$  \n\nAs $\\theta$ varies from $-90^{\\circ}$ to $90^{\\circ}$ in the $s$ plane, the angle of $G(s)H(s)$ varies from $180^{\\circ}$ to $-180^{\\circ}$ , as shown in Figure 7–52. Since there is no pole in the right-half $s$ plane and the locus encircles the $-1+j0$ point twice clockwise for any positive value of $K$ , there are two zeros of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane. Therefore, this system is always unstable.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive visual representation of various mathematical concepts, comprising multiple graphs and charts that illustrate different aspects of complex analysis.

Through the use of graphs and charts, it effectively conveys important ideas and relationships in this field.  \n\nFigure 7–52   \n$s$ -Plane contour and the   \n$G(s)H(s)$ locus in the $G H$   \nplane, where   \n$\\stackrel{.}{G}(s)\\dot{H}(s)\\,=\\,K/\\bigl[s^{2}(T s\\,+\\,1)\\bigr].$  \n\nNote that a similar analysis can be made if $G(s)H(s)$ involves poles and/or zeros on the $j\\omega$ axis.The Nyquist stability criterion can now be generalized as follows:  \n\nNyquist stability criterion [for a general case when $G(s)H(s)$ has poles and/or zeros on the jvaxis ]:In the system shown in Figure 7–44,if the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ has $k$ poles in the right-half $s$ plane, then for stability the $G(s)H(s)$ locus, as a representative point $s$ traces on the modified Nyquist path in the clockwise direction, must encircle the $-1+j0$ point $k$ times in the counterclockwise direction.  \n\n# 7–6 STABILITY ANALYSIS  \n\nIn this section, we shall present several illustrative examples of the stability analysis of control systems using the Nyquist stability criterion.  \n\nIf the Nyquist path in the $s$ plane encircles $Z$ zeros and $P$ poles of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ and does not pass through any poles or zeros of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ as a representative point $s$ moves in the clockwise direction along the Nyquist path, then the corresponding contour in the $G(s)H(s)$ plane encircles the $-1+j0$ point $N\\,=\\,Z\\,-\\,P$ times in the clockwise direction. (Negative values of $N$ imply counterclockwise encirclements.)  \n\nIn examining the stability of linear control systems using the Nyquist stability criterion, we see that three possibilities can occur:  \n\n1. There is no encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point.This implies that the system is stable if there are no poles of $G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane; otherwise, the system is unstable.   \n2. There are one or more counterclockwise encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point.In this case the system is stable if the number of counterclockwise encirclements is the same as the number of poles of $G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane; otherwise, the system is unstable.   \n3. There are one or more clockwise encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point. In this case the system is unstable.  \n\nIn the following examples, we assume that the values of the gain $K$ and the time constants (such as $T,T_{1}$ ,and $T_{2}$ ) are all positive.  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–14 Consider a closed-loop system whose open-loop transfer function is given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{K}{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–53 Polar plot of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ considered in Example 7–14.  \n\nExamine the stability of the system.  \n\nA plot of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ is shown in Figure 7–53. Since $G(s)H(s)$ does not have any poles in the right-half $s$ plane and the $-1+j0$ point is not encircled by the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus, this system is stable for any positive values of $K,T_{1}$ ,and $T_{2}$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a graph of two functions, G(jω) and H(jω), plotted on an Argand diagram. The Argand diagram is a complex plane that displays the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **G(jω)**: This function is represented by a semicircle with its center at (1, 0) and radius 1. It starts from the point (-1, 0) on the negative real axis and ends at the point (1, 0) on the positive real axis.\n*   **H(jω)**: This function is represented by a semicircle with its center at (-1, 0) and radius 1. It starts from the point (1, 0) on the positive real axis and ends at the point (-1, 0) on the negative real axis.\n*   **Imaginary Axis**: The imaginary axis is represented by the y-axis, which ranges from -1 to 1.\n*   **Real Axis**: The real axis is represented by the x-axis, which ranges from -1 to 1.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n*   Both G(jω) and H(jω) are semicircles with a radius of 1.\n*   They have opposite directions of rotation, with G(jω) rotating counterclockwise and H(jω) rotating clockwise.\n*   The functions intersect at the point (0, -1), where both real and imaginary parts are equal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph represents two complex-valued functions, G(jω) and H(jω), plotted on an Argand diagram. The functions have opposite directions of rotation and intersect at the point (0, -1).  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–15 Consider the system with the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\frac{K}{s(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–54   \nPolar plots of the   \nsystem considered in Example 7–15.  \n\nDetermine the stability of the system for two cases: (1) the gain $K$ is small and (2) $K$ is large. The Nyquist plots of the open-loop transfer function with a small value of $K$ and a large value of $K$ are shown in Figure 7–54.The number of poles of $G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane is zero.  \n\nThe image presents two graphs, each featuring a closed loop and multiple points marked with an X. The left graph is labeled \"Small K\" and the right graph is labeled \"Large K.\" Both graphs have a similar shape, but they differ in size.\n\n*   **Graphs**\n    *   The graphs are enclosed by curved lines that resemble a combination of parabolas and circles.\n    *   Each graph contains three points marked with an X: one near the center, one on the left side, and one on the right side.\n*   **Labels and Legends**\n    *   The x-axis is labeled \"Im\" (imaginary part) and ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   The y-axis is labeled \"Re\" (real part) and also ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   There are no legends or additional labels on the graphs beyond their titles (\"Small K\" and \"Large K\").\n*   **Similarities and Differences**\n    *   Both graphs have a similar shape, but the one labeled \"Large K\" is larger than the one labeled \"Small K.\"\n    *   The X points in both graphs are located at approximately (0.5, 0) for the left graph and (-0.5, 0) for the right graph.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two graphs with similar shapes but different sizes, each featuring three X-marked points. The x-axis represents the imaginary part, while the y-axis represents the real part, both ranging from -1 to 1.  \n\nTherefore, for this system to be stable, it is necessary that $N\\,=\\,Z\\,=\\,0$ or that the $G(s)H(s)$ locus not encircle the $-1+j0$ point.  \n\nFor small values of $K$ , there is no encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point. Hence, the system is stable for small values of $K$ . For large values of $K$ , the locus of $G(s)H(s)$ encircles the $-1+j0$ point twice in the clockwise direction, indicating two closed-loop poles in the right-half $s$ plane, and the system is unstable. (For good accuracy, $K$ should be large. From the stability viewpoint, however, a large value of $K$ causes poor stability or even instability.To compromise between accuracy and stability, it is necessary to insert a compensation network into the system. Compensating techniques in the frequency domain are discussed in Sections 7–11 through 7–13.)  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–16 The stability of a closed-loop system with the following open-loop transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K{(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}}{s^{2}(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)}}\n$$  \n\ndepends on the relative magnitudes of $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ .Draw Nyquist plots and determine the stability of the system.  \n\nPlots of the locus $G(s)H(s)$ for three cases, $T_{1}<T_{2},T_{1}=T_{2}$ ,and $T_{1}>T_{2}$ ,are shown in Figure 7–55. For $T_{1}<T_{2}$ ,the locus of $G(s)H(s)$ does not encircle the $-1+j0$ point, and the closed-loop system is stable. For $T_{1}=T_{2}$ , the $G(s)H(s)$ locus passes through the $-1+j0$ point, which indicates that the closed-loop poles are located on the $j\\omega$ axis. For $T_{1}>T_{2}$ ,the locus of $G(s)H(s)$ encircles the $-1+j0$ point twice in the clockwise direction. Thus, the closed-loop system has two closed-loop poles in the right-half $s$ plane, and the system is unstable.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of three graphs, each illustrating distinct concepts related to signal processing. The top-left graph displays a phase response plot, while the bottom-right graph shows an amplitude response plot.\n\n*   **Phase Response Plot**\n    *   The graph features a circular shape with arrows pointing in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.\n    *   The x-axis represents time, ranging from 0 to T.\n    *   The y-axis represents phase shift, measured in radians.\n    *   Arrows emanating from the origin indicate positive phase shifts, while those pointing towards it represent negative phase shifts.\n*   **Amplitude Response Plot**\n    *   This graph is also circular, with arrows pointing in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency, spanning from 0 to ωmax.\n    *   The y-axis represents amplitude gain, measured on a logarithmic scale.\n    *   Arrows emanating from the origin indicate increasing amplitude gains, while those pointing towards it represent decreasing amplitude gains.\n\nIn summary, the image provides visual representations of phase and amplitude response plots in signal processing. These graphs help engineers analyze and optimize systems by illustrating how input signals are transformed into output signals across different frequencies and time intervals.  \n\nFigure 7–55   \nPolar plots of the   \nsystem considered in Example 7–16.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–17  \n\nConsider the closed-loop system having the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K}{s(T s-1)}}\n$$  \n\nDetermine the stability of the system.  \n\nThe image depicts a complex plane, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics. The complex plane is represented by the real axis (x-axis) and the imaginary axis (y-axis), with the origin at the point (0, 0). This representation allows for the visualization of complex numbers, which have both real and imaginary parts.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Axes:** The x-axis represents the real part of a complex number, while the y-axis represents the imaginary part.\n*   **Origin:** The origin is located at the point (0, 0) where the two axes intersect.\n*   **Labels:** The labels \"Im\" and \"Re\" are used to denote the imaginary and real parts of a complex number, respectively.\n\n**Applications:**\n\nThe complex plane has numerous applications in various fields, including:\n\n*   **Electrical Engineering:** Complex numbers are used to represent impedance and admittance in electrical circuits.\n*   **Signal Processing:** The complex plane is utilized in signal processing techniques such as filtering and modulation analysis.\n*   **Control Systems:** Complex numbers are employed in the design and analysis of control systems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image provides a clear representation of the complex plane, highlighting its importance in various fields. By understanding the concept of the complex plane, one can better appreciate the mathematical tools used to analyze and solve problems in these areas.  \n\nFigure 7–56   \nPolar plot of the   \nsystem considered in Example 7–17.  \n\nThe function $G(s)H(s)$ has one pole $\\mathit{\\Pi}_{S}=1/T\\mathit{\\Omega}$ )in the right-half $s$ plane.Therefore, $P\\,=\\,1,$ .The Nyquist plot shown in Figure 7–56 indicates that the $G(s)H(s)$ plot encircles the $-1+j0$ point once clockwise.Thus, $N=1.$ . Since $Z=N+P$ , we find that $Z=2.$ .This means that the closedloop system has two closed-loop poles in the right-half $s$ plane and is unstable.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–18  \n\nInvestigate the stability of a closed-loop system with the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,3)}{s(s\\,-\\,1)}\\qquad(K>1)\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function has one pole ($s=1$ )in the right-half $s$ plane, or $P\\,=\\,1.$ The open-loop system is unstable. The Nyquist plot shown in Figure 7–57 indicates that the $-1+j0$ point is encircled by the $G(s)H(s)$ locus once in the counterclockwise direction. Therefore, $N=-1.$ Thus, $Z$ is found from $Z=N+P$ to be zero, which indicates that there is no zero of $1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane, and the closed-loop system is stable. This is one of the examples for which an unstable open-loop system becomes stable when the loop is closed.  \n\nThe image depicts a graph of complex numbers, specifically a plot of real and imaginary parts on the x- and y-axes. The graph shows two curves that intersect at three points: one point is located at the origin (0, 0), another point lies on the negative real axis (real part = -1, imaginary part = 0), and the third point has a large positive imaginary component.\n\n*   **Real Axis**\n    *   The x-axis represents the real part of a complex number.\n    *   The y-axis represents the imaginary part of a complex number.\n*   **Complex Numbers**\n    *   Complex numbers are represented as points in the plane, where the x-coordinate corresponds to the real part and the y-coordinate corresponds to the imaginary part.\n    *   Each point on the graph corresponds to a unique complex number.\n*   **Intersections**\n    *   There are three intersection points between the curves: one at the origin (0, 0), another on the negative real axis (real part = -1, imaginary part = 0), and a third with a large positive imaginary component.\n\nThe graph provides a visual representation of complex numbers and their relationships to each other. It helps illustrate how different points in the plane correspond to unique complex numbers, allowing for analysis and manipulation of these mathematical entities.  \n\nFigure 7–57   \nPolar plot of the   \nsystem considered in Example 7–18.  \n\nThe image depicts a graph with two axes, labeled \"Re\" and \"Im\", which represent the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers.

Figure 7–58 shows an example of a $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus for which the closed-loop system can be made unstable by varying the open-loop gain. If the open-loop gain is increased sufficiently, the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus encloses the $-1+j0$ point twice,and the system becomes unstable.If the open-loop gain is decreased sufficiently, again the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus encloses the $-1+j0$ point twice. For stable operation of the system considered here, the critical point $-1+j0$ must not be located in the regions between $O A$ and $B C$ shown in Figure 7–58. Such a system that is stable only for limited ranges of values of the open-loop gain for which the $-1+j0$ point is completely outside the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ locus is a conditionally stable system.  \n\nA conditionally stable system is stable for the value of the open-loop gain lying between critical values, but it is unstable if the open-loop gain is either increased or decreased sufficiently.Such a system becomes unstable when large input signals are applied, since a large signal may cause saturation, which in turn reduces the open-loop gain of the system. It is advisable to avoid such a situation.  \n\nMultiple-Loop System. Consider the system shown in Figure 7–59.This is a multiple-loop system.The inner loop has the transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{G_{2}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{2}(s)H_{2}(s)}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a technical diagram illustrating a signal flow system, comprising various components connected by arrows to convey information. The system is comprised of several key elements:\n\n*   **Input Signal (R(s))**: Represented as an arrow entering the top-left corner of the diagram.\n*   **Additive Gain Block (G1(s))**: Positioned adjacent to the input signal, labeled as \"G1(s)\" within a rectangle.\n*   **Multiplicative Gain Block (G2(s))**: Located below G1(s), also marked with \"G2(s)\" inside its respective box.\n*   **Feedback Path (H2(s) and H1(s))**: Comprises two components: an upper feedback loop involving H2(s) and a lower feedback loop containing H1(s).\n*   **Output Signal (C(s))**: The resulting signal generated by the system, denoted as \"C(s)\" at the bottom-right corner of the diagram.\n\nThe arrows in the diagram represent the flow of information through each component. Each block's label indicates its function or effect on the signal it processes.\n\nIn summary, this diagram depicts a complex signal processing system involving multiple components and feedback loops to generate an output signal based on input data. 7–59 Multiple-loop system.   \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nIf $G(s)$ is unstable,the effects of instability are to produce a pole or poles in the right-half $s$ plane.Then the characteristic equation of the inner loop, $1\\,+\\,G_{2}(s)H_{2}(s)\\,=\\,0,$ has a zero or zeros in the right-half $s$ plane. If $G_{2}(s)$ and $H_{2}(s)$ have $P_{1}$ poles here, then the number $Z_{1}$ of right-half plane zeros of $1\\,+\\,G_{2}(s)H_{2}(s)$ can be found from $Z_{1}=N_{1}+P_{1}$ ,where $N_{1}$ is the number of clockwise encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point by the $G_{2}(s)H_{2}(s)$ locus. Since the open-loop transfer function of the entire system is given by $G_{1}(s)G(s)H_{1}(s)$ , the stability of this closed-loop system can be found from the Nyquist plot of $G_{1}(s)G(s)H_{1}(s)$ and knowledge of the right-half plane poles of $G_{1}(s)G(s)H_{1}(s)$ .  \n\nNotice that if a feedback loop is eliminated by means of block diagram reductions, there is a possibility that unstable poles are introduced; if the feedforward branch is eliminated by means of block diagram reductions, there is a possibility that right-half plane zeros are introduced.Therefore, we must note all right-half plane poles and zeros as they appear from subsidiary loop reductions. This knowledge is necessary in determining the stability of multiple-loop systems.  \n\nConsider the control system shown in Figure 7–60.The system involves two loops. Determine the range of gain $K$ for stability of the system by the use of the Nyquist stability criterion. (The gain $K$ is positive.)  \n\nTo examine the stability of the control system,we need to sketch the Nyquist locus of $G(s)$ ,where  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)\n$$  \n\nHowever, the poles of $G(s)$ are not known at this point.Therefore, we need to examine the minor loop if there are right-half $s$ -plane poles. This can be done easily by use of the Routh stability criterion. Since  \n\n$$\nG_{2}(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{1}{s^{3}\\,+\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nthe Routh array becomes as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c}{{s^{3}}}&{{1}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{s^{2}}}&{{1}}&{{1}}\\\\ {{s^{1}}}&{{-1}}&{{0}}\\\\ {{s^{0}}}&{{1}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNotice that there are two sign changes in the first column. Hence, there are two poles of $G_{2}(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane.  \n\nOnce we find the number of right-half $s$ plane poles of $G_{2}(s)$ ,we proceed to sketch the Nyquist locus of $G(s)$ , where  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,0.5)}{s^{3}\\,+\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, comprising several components and signals. The top-left corner of the image features an arrow pointing to the right with the label \"R(s)\" next to it.\n\nMoving down from this point, we find two blocks: one on the left side and another below it. The first block is labeled \"K(s + 0.5)\" above a small rectangle containing the symbol for multiplication (×). A vertical arrow connects this block to the second block, which has an equation written inside: \"1 / (s + 1)\". Below these blocks lies a third component, denoted by two horizontal arrows pointing towards each other, accompanied by the label \"G2(s)\".\n\nAt the bottom of the diagram, there's another arrow labeled \"C(s)\", followed by a box containing an expression that reads \"K(s) * G1(s)\". All components are connected through lines and arrows, indicating their relationships within the control system.  \n\nFigure 7–60 Control system.  \n\nOur problem is to determine the range of the gain $K$ for stability. Hence, instead of plotting Nyquist loci of $G(j\\omega)$ for various values of $K$ , we plot the Nyquist locus of $G(j\\omega)/K.$ Figure 7–61 shows the Nyquist plot or polar plot of $G(j\\omega)/K$ .  \n\nSince $G(s)$ has two poles in the right-half $s$ plane, we have $P=2$ .Noting that  \n\n$$\nZ=N+P\n$$  \n\nfor stability, we require $Z=0$ or $N=-2.$ . That is, the Nyquist locus of $G(j\\omega)$ must encircle the $-1+j0$ point twice counterclockwise. From Figure 7–61, we see that, if the critical point lies between 0 and $-0.5$ , then the $G(j\\omega)/K$ locus encircles the critical point twice counterclockwise. Therefore, we require  \n\n$$\n-0.5K<-1\n$$  \n\nThe range of the gain $K$ for stability is  \n\n$$\n2<K\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a complex plot of a mathematical function, likely related to signal processing or control systems. The plot features two overlapping ellipses with distinct labels and markings.\n\n**Plot Structure:**\n\n*   **X-axis:** Labeled as \"Re\" (real part) and extends from -1 to 1.\n*   **Y-axis:** Labeled as \"Im\" (imaginary part) and extends from -1.5 to 0.5.\n*   **Ellipses:** Two ellipses are plotted, one centered at (-0.2, -0.3) with major axis along the x-axis and minor axis along the y-axis, and another centered at (0.4, 0.6) with major axis along the x-axis and minor axis along the y-axis.\n*   **Labels:** Each ellipse is labeled with its center coordinates and a unique identifier (A1, A2).\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\n*   **Gridlines:** Gridlines are visible in both directions, providing a reference for reading off values from the plot.\n*   **Axes Labels:** The x-axis is labeled as \"Re\" and the y-axis as \"Im\".\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe image appears to be related to signal processing or control systems, possibly illustrating the behavior of a system or function in the complex plane. The use of ellipses suggests that the plot is showing some form of frequency response or transfer function. Without additional context or information about the specific application, it is difficult to provide further interpretation.\n\nOverall, the image presents a detailed and informative visualization of a mathematical function, likely used for analysis or design purposes in signal processing or control systems. 7–61 Polar plot of $G(j\\omega)/K$ .  \n\nNyquist Stability Criterion Applied to Inverse Polar Plots. In the previous analyses, the Nyquist stability criterion was applied to polar plots of the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ .  \n\nIn analyzing multiple-loop systems, the inverse transfer function may sometimes be used in order to permit graphical analysis; this avoids much of the numerical calculation. (The Nyquist stability criterion can be applied equally well to inverse polar plots. The mathematical derivation of the Nyquist stability criterion for inverse polar plots is the same as that for direct polar plots.)  \n\nThe inverse po $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ is a graph of $1/\\!\\left[G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)\\right]$ as a function of $\\omega$ . For example, if $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ is  \n\nthen  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)=\\displaystyle\\frac{j\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)}=\\frac{1}{j\\omega T}+1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse polar plot for $\\omega\\geq0$ is the lower half of the vertical line starting at the point $(1,0)$ on the real axis.  \n\nThe Nyquist stability criterion applied to inverse plots may be stated as follows: For $1/\\!\\left[G(s)H(s)\\right]$ a closed-loop system to be stable, the encirclement, if any, of the locus $s$ along the Nyquist path) ust be counterc $-1+j0$ point by the CDth f such encircleme ts must be equal to the number of poles of $1/\\!\\left[G(s)H(s)\\right]$ [that is, the zeros of $G(s)H(s)]$ ] that lie in the right-half $s$ plane. [The number of zeros of $G(s)H(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane may be determined by the use of the Routh stability criterion.] If the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ has no zeros in the righthalf $s$ plane, then for a closed-loop system to be stable, the number of encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point by the $1/\\!\\left[G(s)\\mathring{H}(s)\\right]$ locus must be zero.  \n\nNote that although the Nyquist stability criterion can be applied to inverse polar plots, if experimental frequency-response data are incorporated, counting the number of encirclements of the $1/\\bar{\\left[G(s)H(s)\\right]}$ locus ficult because the phase shift corresponding to the infinite semicircular path in the $s$ plane is difficult to measure. For example, if the open-loop transfer function $G(s)H(s)$ involves transport lag such that  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K e^{-j\\omega L}}{s(T s\\,+\\,1)}}\n$$  \n\nthen the number of encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point by the $1/\\!\\left[G(s)H(s)\\right]$ locus becomes infinite, and the Nyquist stability criterion cannot be applied to the inverse polar plot of such an open-loop transfer function.  \n\nIn general, if experimental frequency-response data cannot be put into analytical form, both the $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ and $1/\\!\\left[G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)\\right]$ st be plotted. In addition, the number of right-half plane zeros of G(s)H(s) must be determined. It is more difficult to determine the right-half plane zeros of $G(s)H(s)$ (in other words, to determine whether a given component is minimum phase) than it is to determine the right-half plane poles of $G(s)H(s)$ (in other words, to determine whether the component is stable).  \n\nDepending on whether the data are graphical or analytical and whether nonminimum-phase components are included, an appropriate stability test must be used for multiple-loop systems. If the data are given in analytical form or if mathematical expressions for all the components are known, the application of the Nyquist stability criterion to inverse polar plots causes no difficulty, and multiple-loop systems may be analyzed and designed in the inverse $G H$ plane. (See Problem A–7–15 .)  \n\n# 7–7 RELATIVE STABILITY ANALYSIS  \n\nRelative Stability. In designing a control system, we require that the system be stable. Furthermore, it is necessary that the system have adequate relative stability.  \n\nIn this section, we shall show that the Nyquist plot indicates not only whether a system is stable,but also the degree of stability of a stable system.The Nyquist plot also gives information as to how stability may be improved, if this is necessary.  \n\nIn the following discussion, we shall assume that the systems considered have unity feedback. Note that it is always possible to reduce a system with feedback elements to a unity-feedback system, as shown in Figure 7–62. Hence, the extension of relative stability analysis for the unity-feedback system to nonunity-feedback systems is possible.  \n\nWe shall also assume that, unless otherwise stated, the systems are minimum-phase systems; that is, the open-loop transfer function has neither poles nor zeros in the righthalf $s$ plane.  \n\nRelative Stability Analysis by Conformal Mapping. One of the important problems in analyzing a control system is to find all closed-loop poles or at least those closest to the $j\\omega$ axis (or the dominant pair of closed-loop poles). If the open-loop frequency-response characteristics of a system are known, it may be possible to estimate the closed-loop poles closest to the $j\\omega$ axis. It is noted that the Nyquist locus $G(j\\omega)$ need not be an analytically known function of $\\omega$ . The entire Nyquist locus may be experimentally obtained.The technique to be presented here is essentially graphical and is based on a conformal mapping of the $s$ plane into the $G(s)$ plane.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram illustrating the operation of a filter, comprising two primary components: an input signal and an output signal. The process involves three stages:\n\n*   **Stage 1:** The input signal enters the system through the first component labeled \"G\". This stage represents the filtering process.\n*   **Stage 2:** The filtered signal from Stage 1 passes through the second component labeled \"H\" to the third component, which is also denoted as \"G\".\n*   **Stage 3:** The output signal is produced by combining the signals from the first two stages.\n\nThe block diagram indicates that the output signal is a combination of the input and filtered signals. 7–62 Modification of a system with feedback elements to a unityfeedback system.  \n\nThe image presents a graph of the s-plane, which is a complex plane used to analyze and represent systems in control theory. The s-plane is defined by two axes: the real axis (x-axis) and the imaginary axis (y-axis). The x-axis represents the real part of the complex numbers, while the y-axis represents the imaginary part.\n\n*   **Real Axis (Horizontal Axis):**\n    *   The real axis is labeled with values ranging from -∞ to +∞.\n    *   It represents the real part of the complex numbers in the s-plane.\n*   **Imaginary Axis (Vertical Axis):**\n    *   The imaginary axis is also labeled with values ranging from -∞ to +∞.\n    *   It represents the imaginary part of the complex numbers in the s-plane.\n*   **Origin:**\n    *   The origin of the s-plane is located at the point where both axes intersect (0, 0).\n    *   This point corresponds to the complex number 0+0j.\n*   **Grid Lines:**\n    *   Grid lines are drawn perpendicular to each axis, dividing the plane into equal parts.\n    *   These grid lines help in visualizing and plotting points on the s-plane.\n*   **Labels:**\n    *   The labels on the axes indicate the magnitude of the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers.\n    *   For example, the label \"s\" is used to denote the complex number s = σ + jω, where σ is the real part and ω is the imaginary part.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a standard representation of the s-plane with its x-axis representing the real part and y-axis representing the imaginary part. The origin is located at (0, 0), and grid lines are used to facilitate plotting complex numbers in the plane. 7–63 Conformal mapping of $s$ -plane grids into the $G(s)$ plane.  \n\nThe image presents a complex geometric diagram featuring a G plane, with various curves and labels. The purpose of the diagram is to illustrate relationships between different mathematical concepts.\n\n* A G plane:\n\t+ The G plane is represented by a grid-like structure.\n\t+ It has both horizontal and vertical axes labeled with Greek letters (σ and ω).\n\t+ The origin of the G plane is marked with an arrow pointing towards it.\n* Im axis:\n\t+ The Im axis is a vertical line extending from the top to the bottom of the diagram.\n\t+ It is labeled as \"Im\" at its top end.\n\t+ The Im axis intersects with several curves in the G plane.\n* Re axis:\n\t+ The Re axis is a horizontal line extending from left to right across the diagram.\n\t+ It is labeled as \"Re\" at its right end.\n\t+ The Re axis intersects with several curves in the G plane.\n\nThe diagram illustrates relationships between different mathematical concepts, including complex numbers and their properties. The intersection points of the Im and Re axes with various curves suggest connections between these concepts and other geometric or algebraic structures.  \n\nConsider the conformal mapping of constant$\\sigma$ lines (lines $s\\,=\\,\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega$ , where $\\sigma$ is constant and $\\omega$ varies) and constant$\\omega$ lines (lines $s\\,=\\,\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega$ , where $\\omega$ is constant and $\\sigma$ varies) in the $s$ plane.The $\\sigma=0$ line (the $j\\omega$ axis) in the $s$ plane maps into the Nyquist plot in the $G(s)$ plane.The constant$\\sigma$ lines in the $s$ plane map into curves that are similar to the Nyquist plot and are in a sense parallel to the Nyquist plot, as shown in Figure 7–63.The constant$\\omega$ lines in the $s$ plane map into curves, also shown in Figure 7–63.  \n\nAlthough the shapes of constant$\\sigma$ and constant$\\omega$ loci in the $G(s)$ plane and the closeness of approach of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus to the $-1+j0$ point depend on a particular $G(s)$ , the closeness of approach of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus to the $-1+j0$ point is an indication of the relative stability of a stable system. In general, we may expect that the closer the $G(j\\omega)$ locus is to the $-1+j0$ point, the larger the maximum overshoot is in the step transient response and the longer it takes to damp out.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of complex numbers, specifically highlighting the relationship between real and imaginary parts. The diagram is divided into two sections, each illustrating the concept in a different context.\n\n*   **Section 1:**\n    *   This section depicts a plane with axes labeled \"Re\" (Real) and \"Im\" (Imaginary).\n    *   A point is plotted on this plane, representing a complex number.\n    *   The x-axis corresponds to the real part of the complex number, while the y-axis represents its imaginary part.\n    *   The point's position on the plane indicates the value of the complex number in terms of both real and imaginary components.\n*   **Section 2:**\n    *   This section shows a similar plane but with different labels for the axes: \"s Plane\" instead of just \"Plane\".\n    *   Again, a point is plotted on this plane to represent another complex number.\n    *   The key difference here is that the labels suggest a focus on stability or dynamics, possibly related to control systems or signal processing rather than pure mathematics.\n    *   The visual representation aims to illustrate how these complex numbers can be interpreted in different contexts.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a graphical tool for understanding and comparing complex numbers across various mathematical applications. By depicting complex numbers as points in planes with distinct axes, it facilitates visualization and interpretation of their real and imaginary components. 7–64 Two systems with two closed-loop poles each.  \n\nConsider the two systems shown in Figures 7–64(a) and (b). (In Figure 7–64, the $\\times\\mathbf{\\dot{s}}$ indicate closed-loop poles.) System (a) is obviously more stable than system (b) because the closed-loop poles of system (a) are located farther left than those of system (b). Figures 7–65(a) and (b) show the conformal mapping of $s$ -plane grids into the $G(s)$ plane. The closer the closed-loop poles are located to the $j\\omega$ axis, the closer the $G(j\\omega)$ locus is to the $-1+j0$ point.  \n\nThe image presents a complex graph with multiple axes and labels, showcasing various mathematical concepts. The graph is divided into two main sections, each representing different functions.\n\n*   **Left Section:**\n    *   The left section of the graph features a curved line labeled \"G\" on the x-axis.\n    *   A horizontal line intersects this curve at a point marked \"-1\".\n    *   An arrow points to the intersection, indicating that the function G crosses the real axis at -1.\n*   **Right Section:**\n    *   The right section of the graph features a curved line labeled \"G\" on the x-axis.\n    *   A horizontal line intersects this curve at a point marked \"-1\".\n    *   An arrow points to the intersection, indicating that the function G crosses the real axis at -1.\n*   **Labels and Axes:**\n    *   The graph includes labels for the x and y axes, with \"Im\" on the vertical axis and \"Re\" on the horizontal axis.\n    *   The origin (0, 0) is marked at the center of the graph.\n*   **Additional Features:**\n    *   A curved line labeled \"G(jω)\" appears in both sections of the graph.\n    *   An arrow points to this line, indicating that it represents a complex function.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two graphical representations of mathematical functions, with labels and axes providing context. The graphs appear to be related to complex analysis or signal processing concepts. 7–65 Conformal mappings of $s$ -plane grids for the systems shown in Figure 7–64 into the $G(s)$ plane.  \n\nFigure 7–66   \nPolar plots of   \n$\\frac{K(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{a})(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{b})\\cdots}{(j\\omega)(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{1})(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{2})\\cdots}.$  \n\nPhase and Gain Margins. Figure 7–66 shows the polar plots of $G(j\\omega)$ for three different values of the open-loop gain $K$ . For a large value of the gain $K$ , the system is unstable.As the gain is decreased to a certain value, the $G(j\\omega)$ locus passes through the $-1+j0$ point.This means that with this gain value the system is on the verge of instability, and the system will exhibit sustained oscillations. For a small value of the gain $K$ ,the system is stable.  \n\nIn general, the closer the $G(j\\omega)$ locus comes to encircling the $-1\\,+\\,j0$ point, the more oscillatory is the system response.The closeness of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus to the $-1+j0$ point can be used as a measure of the margin of stability. (This does not apply, however, to conditionally stable systems.) It is common practice to represent the closeness in terms of phase margin and gain margin.  \n\nPhase margin: The phase margin is that amount of additional phase lag at the gain crossover frequency required to bring the system to the verge of instability.The gain crossover frequency is the frequency at which $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ ,magnitude of the ope loop transfer function, is unity.The phase margin $\\gamma$ is 180° plus the phase angle $\\phi$ of the open-loop transfer function at the gain crossover frequency, or  \n\n$$\n\\gamma=180^{\\circ}+\\phi\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two curves, each representing the relationship between gain and frequency. The x-axis is labeled \"R\" and ranges from -1 to 0, while the y-axis is labeled \"Im\" and spans from 0 to 2.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Curves:** Two curves are visible on the graph:\n    *   A larger curve, which appears to be a parabola.\n    *   A smaller curve, also resembling a parabola but with a more gentle slope.\n*   **Labels:** The following labels are present on the graph:\n    *   \"G Plane\" at the top left corner.\n    *   \"K: Large\" at the bottom left corner of the larger curve.\n    *   \"K: Small K = open-loop gain\" at the bottom right corner of the smaller curve.\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n*   The graph seems to be illustrating the relationship between gain and frequency for different systems or components, with the larger curve representing a system with higher gain and the smaller curve representing one with lower gain.\n*   The labels suggest that the graph is related to control theory or signal processing, where \"G Plane\" likely refers to the complex plane used in control system analysis.  \n\nFigures 7–67(a), (b), and (c) illustrate the phase margin of both a stable system and an unstable system in Bode diagrams,polar plots,and log-magnitude-versus-phase plots. In the polar plot, a line may be drawn from the origin to the point at which the unit circle crosses the $G(j\\omega)$ locus. If this line lies below (above) the negative real axis, then the angle $\\gamma$ is positive (negative).The angle from the negative real axis to this line is the phase margin.The phase margin is positive for $\\gamma>0$ and negative for $\\gamma<0$ . For a minimumphase system to be stable, the phase margin must be positive. In the logarithmic plots, the critical point in the complex plane corresponds to the 0-dB and $-180^{\\circ}$ lines.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of two distinct systems: the stable system and the unstable system. The top portion of the image is dedicated to the stable system, while the bottom section focuses on the unstable system.\n\n**Stable System (Top Portion)**\n\n*   **Graph 1:** A logarithmic graph displaying the relationship between gain margin and phase margin.\n    *   Gain margin: The amount by which the system's gain exceeds unity at a specific frequency.\n    *   Phase margin: The difference in degrees between the phase angle of the system's open-loop transfer function and -180° at the same frequency.\n*   **Graph 2:** A logarithmic graph illustrating the relationship between loop gain and phase angle.\n    *   Loop gain: The product of the forward path gain and the feedback path gain.\n    *   Phase angle: The difference in degrees between the phase angles of the system's open-loop transfer function and -180° at a specific frequency.\n\n**Unstable System (Bottom Portion)**\n\n*   **Graph 3:** A logarithmic graph showing the relationship between loop gain and phase angle.\n    *   Loop gain: The product of the forward path gain and the feedback path gain.\n    *   Phase angle: The difference in degrees between the phase angles of the system's open-loop transfer function and -180° at a specific frequency.\n*   **Graph 4:** A logarithmic graph illustrating the relationship between loop gain and phase margin.\n    *   Loop gain: The product of the forward path gain and the feedback path gain.\n    *   Phase margin: The difference in degrees between the phase angle of the system's open-loop transfer function and -180° at a specific frequency.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a detailed comparison of the stable system and the unstable system, highlighting their differences in terms of gain margin, phase margin, loop gain, and phase angle. The logarithmic graphs used in the analysis allow for a clear visualization of these relationships, enabling easier identification of potential issues and improvements in each system's performance. 7–67 Phase and gain margins of stable and unstable systems. (a) Bode diagrams; (b) polar plots; (c) log-magnitudeversus-phase plots.   \n(c)  \n\nGain m gin: The gain margin is the r cal of the magnitude $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ at the frequency at which the phase angle is $-180^{\\circ}$ °. Defining the phase crossover frequency $\\omega_{1}$ to be the frequency at which the phase angle of the open-loop transfer function equals $-180^{\\circ}$ gives the gain margin $K_{g}$ :  \n\n$$\nK_{g}=\\frac{1}{\\left|G(j\\omega_{1})\\right|}\n$$  \n\nIn terms of decibels,  \n\n$$\nK_{g}\\,\\mathrm{dB}\\,=\\,20\\log K_{g}=-20\\log\\left|G\\!\\left(j\\omega_{1}\\right)\\right|\n$$  \n\nThe gain margin expressed in decibels is positive if $K_{g}$ is greater than unity and negative if $K_{g}$ is smaller than unity.Thus, a positive gain margin (in decibels) means that the system is stable, and a negative gain margin (in decibels) means that the system is unstable.The gain margin is shown in Figures 7–67(a), (b), and (c).  \n\nFor a stable minimum-phase system,the gain margin indicates how much the gain can be increased before the system becomes unstable. For an unstable system, the gain margin is indicative of how much the gain must be decreased to make the system stable.  \n\nThe gain margin of a first- or second-order system is infinite since the polar plots for such systems do not cross the negative real axis. Thus, theoretically, first- or secondorder systems cannot be unstable. (Note, however, that so-called first- or second-order systems are only approximations in the sense that small time lags are neglected in deriving the system equations and are thus not truly first- or second-order systems. If these small lags are accounted for, the so-called first- or second-order systems may become unstable.)  \n\nIt is noted that for a nonminimum-phase system with unstable open loop the stability condition will not be satisfied unless the $G(j\\omega)$ plot encircles the $-1+j0$ point. Hence, such a stable nonminimum-phase system will have negative phase and gain margins.  \n\nIt is also important to point out that conditionally stable systems will have two or more phase crossover frequencies, and some higher-order systems with complicated numerator dynamics may also have two or more gain crossover frequencies, as shown in Figure 7–68. For stable systems having two or more gain crossover frequencies, the phase margin is measured at the highest gain crossover frequency.  \n\nA Few Comments on Phase and Gain Margins. The phase and gain margins of a control system are a measure of the closeness of the polar plot to the $-1+j0$ point. Therefore, these margins may be used as design criteria.  \n\nIt should be noted that either the gain margin alone or the phase margin alone does not give a sufficient indication of the relative stability. Both should be given in the determination of relative stability.  \n\nFor a minimum-phase system, both the phase and gain margins must be positive for the system to be stable. Negative margins indicate instability.  \n\nProper phase and gain margins ensure us against variations in the system components and are specified for definite positive values.The two values bound the behavior of the closed-loop system near the resonant frequency. For satisfactory performance, the phase margin should be between $30^{\\circ}$ and $60^{\\circ}$ , and the gain margin should be greater than 6 dB. With these values, a minimum-phase system has guaranteed stability, even if the openloop gain and time constants of the components vary to a certain extent.Although the phase and gain margins give only rough estimates of the effective damping ratio of the closed-loop system, they do offer a convenient means for designing control systems or adjusting the gain constants of systems.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of phase crossover frequencies and gain crossover frequencies, showcasing their relationships and characteristics. The diagram is divided into two main sections: \"Phase Crossover Frequencies\" on the left and \"Gain Crossover Frequencies\" on the right.\n\n**Phase Crossover Frequencies**\n\n*   This section illustrates the phase crossover frequencies in a Bode plot format.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency (in Hz), while the y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function (in dB).\n    *   A dashed line indicates the 0 dB reference, signifying no attenuation or amplification.\n    *   Three distinct frequency points are marked on the graph:\n        1.  **ω1**: The first phase crossover frequency, where the phase angle crosses the 0° mark.\n        2.  **ω2**: The second phase crossover frequency, located at a higher frequency than ω1.\n        3.  **ω3**: The third phase crossover frequency, situated at an even higher frequency than ω2.\n\n**Gain Crossover Frequencies**\n\n*   This section displays the gain crossover frequencies in a similar Bode plot format as the previous section.\n    *   Again, the x-axis represents the frequency (in Hz), and the y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function (in dB).\n    *   The dashed line at 0 dB serves as a reference for no attenuation or amplification.\n    *   Three notable frequency points are highlighted:\n        1.  **ω4**: The first gain crossover frequency, where the gain crosses the 0 dB mark.\n        2.  **ω5**: The second gain crossover frequency, positioned at a higher frequency than ω4.\n        3.  **ω6**: The third gain crossover frequency, located at an even higher frequency than ω5.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a detailed comparison of phase and gain crossover frequencies, illustrating their distinct characteristics and relationships within the context of transfer functions and Bode plots. 7–68 Polar plots showing more than two phase or gain crossover frequencies.  \n\nObtain the phase and gain margins of the system shown in Figure 7–69 for the two cases where $K=10$ and $K=100$ .  \n\nFor minimum-phase systems, the magnitude and phase characteristics of the openloop transfer function are definitely related.The requirement that the phase margin be between $30^{\\circ}$ and $60^{\\circ}$ means that in a Bode diagram the slope of the log-magnitude curve at the gain crossover frequency should be more gradual than $-40$ dB 'decade. In most practical cases, a slope of $-20$ dB 'decade is desirable at the gain crossover frequency for stability. If it is $-40$ dB 'decade, the system could be either stable or unstable. (Even if the system is stable,however,the phase margin is small.) If the slope at the gain crossover frequency is $-60$ dB 'decade or steeper, the system is most likely unstable.  \n\nFor nonminimum-phase systems, the correct interpretation of stability margins requires careful study.The best way to determine the stability of nonminimum-phase systems is to use the Nyquist diagram approach rather than Bode diagram approach.  \n\nFigure 7–69 Control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between different components in a control system. The diagram shows the input signal (R(s)), the transfer function (K/s + 1), and the output signal (C(s)).\n\n*   **Input Signal**\n    *   The input signal is represented by R(s) and is applied to the system.\n*   **Transfer Function**\n    *   The transfer function is represented by K/(s + 1) and describes how the system responds to the input signal.\n    *   It consists of two parts: a constant gain (K) and an exponential term (e^(-t)).\n    *   The transfer function determines the behavior of the system in response to different frequencies.\n*   **Output Signal**\n    *   The output signal is represented by C(s) and is the result of applying the input signal to the system through the transfer function.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram shows a simple control system with an input signal, a transfer function that describes its behavior, and an output signal that results from this interaction. This type of diagram is commonly used in control engineering to analyze and design control systems.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of two distinct frequency response plots, each comprising four graphs. The top-left graph (K = 10) displays the magnitude response (|G| in dB) versus frequency (ω), while the bottom-left graph shows the phase response (θ) versus frequency. Similarly, the top-right graph (K = 100) illustrates the magnitude response (|G| in dB) versus frequency, and the bottom-right graph depicts the phase response (θ) versus frequency.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Magnitude Response:** The magnitude response plots reveal a downward trend in |G| as ω increases for both K values. Notably, the plot with K = 100 exhibits a more pronounced decrease.\n*   **Phase Response:** The phase response plots indicate an increase in θ as ω grows larger for both K values. Again, the plot with K = 100 displays a steeper incline.\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n*   The presence of these frequency response plots suggests that they are being used to analyze and compare the performance of two different systems or components.\n*   The magnitude response plots provide insight into the attenuation characteristics of each system, while the phase response plots offer information about their timing behavior.\n*   By examining both sets of plots simultaneously, it is possible to identify potential trade-offs between signal fidelity and processing speed, as well as differences in overall system performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image presents a thorough examination of two distinct frequency response plots, offering valuable insights into the characteristics of each system. By analyzing both magnitude and phase responses, one can gain a deeper understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses, ultimately informing decisions about system design or optimization. 7–70 Bode diagrams of the system shown in Figure 7–69; (a) with $K=10$ and (b) with $K=100$ .  \n\nThe phase and gain margins can easily be obtained from the Bode diagram.A Bode diagram of the given open-loop transfer function with $K=10$ is shown in Figure 7–70(a).The phase and gain margins for $K=10$ are  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Phase\\;margin}\\,=\\,21^{\\circ},\\qquad\\mathrm{Gain\\;margin}\\,=\\,8\\;\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the system gain may be increased by $\\mathrm{8\\dB}$ before the instability occurs. Increasing the gain from $K=10$ to $K=100$ shifts the 0-dB axis down by $20\\:\\mathrm{dB}$ , as shown in Figure 7–70(b).The phase and gain margins are  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Phase\\;margin}\\,=\\,-30^{\\circ},\\qquad\\mathrm{Gain\\;margin}\\,=\\,-12\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nThus, the system is stable for $K=10$ ,but unstable for $K=100$ .  \n\nNotice that one of the very convenient aspects of the Bode diagram approach is the ease with which the effects of gain changes can be evaluated.Note that to obtain satisfactory performance,we must increase the phase margin to $30^{\\circ}\\sim60^{\\circ}$ .This can be done by decreasing the gain $K$ . Decreasing $K$ is not desirable, however, since a small value of $K$ will yield a large error for the ramp input. This suggests that reshaping of the open-loop frequency-response curve by adding compensation may be necessary. Compensation techniques are discussed in detail in Sections 7–11 through 7–13.  \n\nObtaining Gain Margin, Phase Margin, Phase-Crossover Frequency, and GainCrossover Frequency with MATLAB.

The transfer function is represented by a rectangle with two inputs and one output.\n\n*   **Transfer Function**\n    *   The transfer function is given as:\n\n      20(s + 1) / (s^2 + 5s + 10)\n\n    *   It has two inputs: one for the signal u(t) and another for the signal y(t).\n    *   The output of the transfer function is denoted as G(s).\n*   **Integrator**\n    *   The integrator is represented by a circle with an arrow pointing to it from the output of the transfer function.\n    *   It integrates the signal G(s) with respect to time t, producing an output signal x(t).\n\nThe block diagram illustrates how the input signal u(t) is processed through the transfer function and then integrated over time to produce the final output signal x(t).  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet written in MATLAB, specifically designed to solve the system of linear equations:\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\n5x + 3y &= 20 \\\\\n2x - y &= 4\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n**Code Breakdown**\n\n* The code utilizes the built-in `mldivide` operator (`\\`) for matrix division, which is equivalent to solving systems of linear equations.\n* The equation coefficients are defined as:\n\t+ Coefficient Matrix (A): `[5 3; 2 -1]`\n\t+ Constant Vector (b): `[20; 4]`\n* The code solves the system of linear equations using the `mldivide` operator, assigning the solution to the variable `ans`.\n\n**Result**\n\nThe solution is represented as a vector:\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.2 \\\\ -0.8 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThis solution satisfies both equations, demonstrating that the code has successfully solved the system of linear equations.\n\n*Answer*: `[3.2000; -0.8000]`  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: one for magnitude and another for phase.\n\n**Magnitude Plot**\n\n*   **Title:** Magnitude (dB)\n*   **Y-axis:** Decibel scale ranging from -100 dB to 50 dB\n*   **X-axis:** Frequency in radians per second (rad/sec), spanning from 10^-1 rad/sec to 10^2 rad/sec\n\nThe magnitude plot displays the gain of the system as a function of frequency. The curve exhibits a peak at approximately 9.9293 dB, indicating resonance or maximum amplification. Beyond this point, the gain decreases gradually until it reaches 0 dB at around 4.0131 rad/sec.\n\n**Phase Plot**\n\n*   **Title:** Phase (deg)\n*   **Y-axis:** Phase angle in degrees, ranging from -300° to 50°\n*   **X-axis:** Frequency in radians per second (rad/sec), spanning from 10^-1 rad/sec to 10^2 rad/sec\n\nThe phase plot illustrates the shift in the signal's phase as a function of frequency.

The closed-loop frequency response is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(j\\omega)}{R(j\\omega)}=\\frac{1}{\\left(1\\,-\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}\\right)\\,+\\,j2\\zeta\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}}=M e^{j\\alpha}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n{\\cal M}={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-{\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}}\\right)^{2}+\\left(2\\zeta\\,{\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}}\\right)^{2}}}},\\qquad\\alpha=-\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{2\\zeta\\,{\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{n}}}}{1-{\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\omega_{n}^{2}}}}}\n$$  \n\nAs given by Equation (7–12), for $0\\le\\zeta\\le0.707$ , the maximum value of $M$ occurs at the frequency $\\omega_{r}$ , where  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{r}\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,2\\zeta^{2}}\n$$  \n\nThe frequency $\\omega_{r}$ is the resonant frequency. At the resonant frequency, the value of $M$ is maximum and is given by Equation (7–13), rewritten  \n\n$$\nM_{r}=\\frac{1}{2\\zeta\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $M_{r}$ is defined as the resonant peak magnitude . The resonant peak magnitude is related to the damping of the system.  \n\nThe magnitude of the resonant peak gives an indication of the relative stability of the system. A large resonant peak magnitude indicates the presence of a pair of dominant closed-loop poles with small damping ratio, which will yield an undesirable transient response.A smaller resonant peak magnitude, on the other hand, indicates the absence of a pair of dominant closed-loop poles with small damping ratio, meaning that the system is well damped.  \n\nRemember that $\\omega_{r}$ is real only if $\\zeta<0.707.$ .Thus, there is no closed-loop resonance if $\\zeta>0.707$ . [The value of $M_{r}$ is unity only if $\\zeta>0.707$ . See Equation (7–14).] Since the values of $M_{r}$ and $\\omega_{r}$ can be easily measured in a physical system, they are quite useful for checking agreement between theoretical and experimental analyses.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and signals.

The system's behavior is determined by the values of $\\omega_n$, $s$, and $\\tau$. 7–73 Standard secondorder system.  \n\nIt is noted, however, that in practical design problems the phase margin and gain margin are more frequently specified than the resonant peak magnitude to indicate the degree of damping in a system.  \n\nCorrelation between Step Transient Response and Frequency Response in the Standard Second-Order System. The maximum overshoot in the unit-step response of the standard second-order system, as shown in Figure 7–73, can be exactly correlated with the resonant peak magnitude in the frequency response. Hence, essentially the same information about the system dynamics is contained in the frequency response as is in the transient response.  \n\nFor a unit-step input,the output of the system shown in Figure 7–73 is given by Equation (5–12), or  \n\n$$\nc(t)\\,=\\,1\\,-\\,e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}\\biggl(\\cos\\omega_{d}t\\,+\\,\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}}\\sin\\omega_{d}t\\biggl),\\mathrm{~\\\\\\~for\\,}t\\ge0\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{d}\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}\n$$  \n\nOn the other hand, the maximum overshoot $M_{p}$ 2 for the unit-step response is given by Equation (5–21), or  \n\n$$\nM_{p}\\,=\\,e^{-(\\zeta/\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^{2}})\\pi}\n$$  \n\nThis maximum overshoot occurs in the transient response that has the damped natural frequency $\\omega_{d}\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{1\\,-\\,\\zeta^{2}}$ .The maximum overshoot becomes excessive for values of $\\zeta<0.4$ .  \n\nSince the second-order system shown in Figure 7–73 has the open-loop transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{\\omega_{n}^{2}}{s(s+2\\zeta\\omega_{n})}}\n$$  \n\nfor sinusoidal operation, the magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ becomes unity when  \n\n$$\n\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{n}\\sqrt{\\sqrt{1\\,+\\,4\\zeta^{4}}\\,-\\,2\\zeta^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwhich can be obtai equating $\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|$ to unity and solving for $\\omega$ .At this frequency, the phase angle of $G(j\\omega)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\boxed{G(j\\omega)=-\\boxed{j\\omega}-\\boxed{j\\omega+2\\zeta\\omega_{n}}=-90^{\\circ}-\\tan^{-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{1+4\\zeta^{4}}-2\\zeta^{2}}}{2\\zeta}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus, the phase margin $\\gamma$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\gamma=180^{\\circ}+\\,\\underbrace{\\left|G(j\\omega)\\right|}_{\\mathrm{tan}^{-1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{1+4\\zeta^{4}}-2\\zeta^{2}}}{2\\zeta}}}}\\\\ &{=\\,\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{2\\zeta}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt{1+4\\zeta^{4}}-2\\zeta^{2}}}}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nEquation (7–21) gives the relationship between the damping ratio $\\zeta$ and the phase margin $\\gamma$ . (Notice that the phase margin $\\gamma$ is a function only of the damping ratio $\\zeta$ .)  \n\nThe image depicts a graph featuring an upward-sloping curved line, with a grid pattern serving as its backdrop. The curved line originates at approximately 0° on the y-axis and ascends towards the rightmost side of the graph.\n\nAt the bottom left corner of the graph is a dashed line that intersects with the curved line. A label positioned directly below this intersection reads \"Straight-line approximation\". This label suggests that the curved line represents an idealized curve, while the dashed line denotes a more direct or simplified representation of the same data.\n\nThe x-axis of the graph spans from approximately 0 to 2 on the rightmost side and is labeled with Greek letters, including ζ (zeta), ξ (xi), and ω (omega). The y-axis extends from approximately -10° at the bottom left corner to 90° at the top of the graph.\n\nThe grid pattern of the graph comprises small squares and dotted lines that crisscross the entire background. This design choice facilitates reading off numerical values, enabling users to accurately determine both x and y coordinates within the graph's confines. 7–74 Curve $\\gamma$ (phase margin) versus $\\zeta$ for the system shown in Figure 7–73.  \n\nIn the following,we shall summarize the correlation between the step transient response and frequency response of the standard second-order system given by Equation (7–16):  \n\n1. The phase margin and the damping ratio are directly related.Figure 7–74 shows a plot of the phase margin $\\gamma$ as a function of the damping ratio $\\zeta$ .It is noted that for the standard second-order system shown in Figure 7–73,the phase margin $\\gamma$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$ are related approximately by a straight line for $0\\leq\\zeta\\leq0.6,$ , as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\zeta=\\frac{\\gamma}{100^{\\circ}}\n$$  \n\nThus a phase margin of $60^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a damping ratio of 0.6. For higher-order systems having a dominant pair of closed-loop poles, this relationship may be used as a rule of thumb in estimating the relative stability in the transient response (that is, the damping ratio) from the frequency response.  \n\n2. Referring to Equations (7–17) and (7–19), we see that the values of $\\omega_{r}$ and $\\omega_{d}$ are almost the same for small values of $\\zeta$ .Thus, for small values of $\\zeta$ , the value of $\\omega_{r}$ is indicative of the speed of the transient response of the system. 3. From Equations (7–18) and (7–20), we note that the smaller the value of $\\zeta$ is, the larger the values of tion of $\\zeta$ is shown in Figure 7–75.A close relationship between $M_{r}$ and $M_{p}$ are.The correlation between $M_{r}$ $M_{r}$ and A and $M_{p}$ $M_{p}$ as a funccan be Bseen for $\\zeta>0.4.$ For very small values of $\\zeta,M_{r}$ becomes very large $\\left[M_{r}\\gg1\\right]$ , while the value of $M_{p}$ does not exceed 1.  \n\nCorrelation between Step Transient Response and Frequency Response in General Systems. The design of control systems is very often carried out on the basis of the frequency response.The main reason for this is the relative simplicity of this approach compared with others. Since in many applications it is the transient response of the system to aperiodic inputs rather than the steady-state response to sinusoidal inputs that is of primary concern, the question of correlation between transient response and frequency response arises.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two curved lines, each representing a distinct mathematical function. The graph is set against a white background and features a black grid pattern.\n\n*   **Graph**\n    *   The graph displays two curved lines, one above the other.\n    *   The top curve represents the equation M = (1 / 2ζ√(1 - ζ^2)) and is labeled \"M\" on the y-axis.\n    *   The bottom curve represents the equation p = c(t_p) - 1 and is labeled \"p\" on the y-axis.\n    *   The x-axis ranges from 0 to 1, with increments of 0.2.\n*   **Equations**\n    *   The top curve's equation is M = (1 / 2ζ√(1 - ζ^2)), where M represents the magnitude and ζ represents the damping ratio.\n    *   The bottom curve's equation is p = c(t_p) - 1, where p represents the pressure and t_p represents time.\n*   **Labels**\n    *   The y-axis labels are \"M\" and \"p\", representing the magnitude and pressure, respectively.\n    *   The x-axis label is not explicitly stated but appears to represent a dimensionless quantity related to the damping ratio.\n*   **Grid Pattern**\n    *   The graph features a black grid pattern, which helps to visually distinguish between the two curves.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two curved lines representing different mathematical functions, with labels and equations provided for each curve. The graph is set against a white background with a black grid pattern, making it easy to read and understand. 7–75 Curves $M_{r}$ versus $\\zeta$ and $M_{p}$ versus $\\zeta$ for the system shown in Figure 7–73.  \n\nFor the standard second-order system shown in Figure 7–73, mathematical relationships correlating the step transient response and frequency response can be obtained easily.The time response of the standard second-order system can be predicted exactly from a knowledge of the $M_{r}$ and $\\omega_{r}$ of its closed-loop frequency response.  \n\nFor nonstandard second-order systems and higher-order systems, the correlation is more complex, and the transient response may not be predicted easily from the frequency response because additional zeros and/or poles may change the correlation between the step transient response and the frequency response existing for the standard second-order system. Mathematical techniques for obtaining the exact correlation are available, but they are very laborious and of little practical value.  \n\nThe applicability of the transient-response–frequency-response correlation existing for the standard second-order system shown in Figure 7–73 to higher-order systems depends on the presence of a dominant pair of complex-conjugate closed-loop poles in the latter systems. Clearly, if the frequency response of a higher-order system is dominated by a pair of complex-conjugate closed-loop poles, the transient-response– frequency-response correlation existing for the standard second-order system can be extended to the higher-order system.  \n\nFor linear, time-invariant, higher-order systems having a dominant pair of complexconjugate closed-loop poles, the following relationships generally exist between the step transient response and frequency response:  \n\n1. The value of formance is usually obtained if the value of $M_{r}$ is indicative of the relative stability. Satisfactory transient perB$M_{r}$ is in the range $1.0<M_{r}<1.4$ $\\mathrm{0\\dB<}M_{r}<3$ dB , whi corresponds to an effective da ing ratio of $0.4<\\zeta<0.7.$ . For values of $M_{r}$ greater than 1.5, the step transient response may exhibit several overshoots. (Note that, in general, a large value of $M_{r}$ corresponds to a large overshoot in the step transient response. If the system is subjected to noise signals whose frequencies are near the resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ , the noise will be amplified in the output and will present serious problems.) 2. The magnitude of the resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ is indicative of the speed of the transient response.The larger the value of $\\omega_{r}$ , the faster the time response is. In other words, the rise time varies inversely with $\\omega_{r}$ . In terms of the open-loop frequency response, the damped natural frequency in the transient response is somewhere between the gain crossover frequency and phase crossover frequency.  \n\n3. The resonant peak frequency $\\omega_{r}$ and the damped natural frequency $\\omega_{d}$ for the step transient response are very close to each other for lightly damped systems.  \n\nThe three relationships just listed are useful for correlating the step transient response with the frequency response of higher-order systems, provided that they can be approximated by the standard second-order system or a pair of complex-conjugate closed-loop poles. If a higher-order system satisfies this condition, a set of time-domain specifications may be translated into frequency-domain specifications. This simplifies greatly the design work or compensation work of higher-order systems.  \n\nIn addition to the phase margin, gain margin, resonant peak $M_{r}$ , and resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ , there are other frequency-domain quantities commonly used in performance specifications.They are the cutoff frequency, bandwidth, and the cutoff rate.These will be defined in what follows.  \n\nCutoff Frequency and Bandwidth. Referring to Figure 7–76, the frequency $\\omega_{b}$ at which the magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response is $3\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ below its zero-frequency value is called the cutoff frequency .Thus  \n\n$$\n\\left|{\\frac{C(j\\omega)}{R(j\\omega)}}\\right|\\,<\\,\\left|{\\frac{C(j0)}{R(j0)}}\\right|\\,-\\,3\\;\\mathrm{dB},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\;\\omega>\\omega_{b}\n$$  \n\nFor systems in which $\\left|C(j0)/R(j0)\\right|\\,=\\,0\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ ,  \n\n$$\n\\left|{\\frac{C(j\\omega)}{R(j\\omega)}}\\right|\\,<-3\\,\\mathrm{dB},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\omega>\\,\\omega_{b}\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop system filters out the signal components whose frequencies are greater than the cutoff frequency and transmits those signal components with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.  \n\nThe frequency range $0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\omega_{b}$ in which the magnitude of $C(j\\omega)/R(j\\omega)$ is greater than $-3\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ is called the bandwidth of the system. The bandwidth indicates the frequency where the gain starts to fall off from its low-frequency value.Thus, the bandwidth indicates how well the system will track an input sinusoid. Note that for a given $\\omega_{n}$ , the rise time increases with increasing damping ratio $\\zeta$ . On the other hand, the bandwidth decreases with the increase in $\\zeta$ .Therefore, the rise time and the bandwidth are inversely proportional to each other.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a black line that exhibits a gradual decline in value from left to right, accompanied by two labels: \"Bandwidth\" and \"ωb\". The x-axis is labeled as \"ω\" (omega) while the y-axis is labeled as \"dB\" (decibels). \n\n*   The graph features a black line that starts at approximately 0 dB on the y-axis and gradually decreases in value as it moves to the right along the x-axis.\n    *   At its peak, the line reaches around 3 dB on the y-axis before beginning its downward trajectory.\n    *   As the line approaches the end of the graph, it drops significantly, reaching a value close to -40 dB on the y-axis.\n*   The term \"dB\" is typically used in audio engineering and acoustics to measure the level or intensity of sound waves. In this context, it likely represents decibel levels.\n*   The x-axis is labeled with Greek letter ω (omega), which is often used to denote angular frequency in physics and mathematics. This suggests that the graph might be related to frequency response or transfer functions.\n*   Two labels are present on the image:\n    *   \"Bandwidth\": This term refers to the range of frequencies over which a system, process, or signal can operate effectively without significant degradation or loss of information. It is often measured in units of Hz (hertz) or kHz (kilohertz).\n    *   \"ωb\" (omega b): This label likely represents the bandwidth itself, indicating that ωb corresponds to the maximum frequency at which a system operates within its designated bandwidth.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a graph showing how the amplitude of an audio signal decreases over time as it approaches its cutoff frequency. The labels indicate that the graph is related to the concept of bandwidth and its impact on sound waves or signals in general. 7–76 Plot of a closed-loop frequency response curve showing cutoff frequency $\\omega_{b}$ and bandwidth.   \nv  \n\nThe specification of the bandwidth may be determined by the following factors:  \n\n1. The ability to reproduce the input signal.A large bandwidth corresponds to a small rise time,or fast response.Roughly speaking,we can say that the bandwidth is proportional to the speed of response. (For example, to decrease the rise time in the step response by a factor of 2, the bandwidth must be increased by approximately a factor of 2.)  \n\n2. The necessary filtering characteristics for high-frequency noise.  \n\nFor the system to follow arbitrary inputs accurately, it must have a large bandwidth. From the viewpoint of noise,however,the bandwidth should not be too large.Thus,there are conflicting requirements on the bandwidth,and a compromise is usually necessary for good design. Note that a system with large bandwidth requires high-performance components, so the cost of components usually increases with the bandwidth.  \n\nCutoff Rate. The cutoff rate is the slope of the log-magnitude curve near the cutoff frequency.The cutoff rate indicates the ability of a system to distinguish the signal from noise.  \n\nIt is noted that a closed-loop frequency response curve with a steep cutoff characteristic may have a large resonant peak magnitude, which implies that the system has a relatively small stability margin.  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–22 Consider the following two systems:  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{System~I:}\\quad\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{1}{s\\,+\\,1},\\qquad\\mathrm{System~II:}\\quad\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{1}{3s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nCompare the bandwidths of these two systems.Show that the system with the larger bandwidth has a faster speed of response and can follow the input much better than the one with the smaller bandwidth.  \n\nFigure 7–77(a) shows the closed-loop frequency-response curves for the two systems. (Asymptotic curves are shown by dashed lines.) We find that the bandwidth of system I is $0\\leq\\omega\\leq1$ rad 'sec and that of system II is $0\\leq\\omega\\leq0.33\\,\\mathrm{rad/sec}.$ . Figures 7–77(b) and (c) show, respectively, the unit-step response and unit-ramp response curves for the two systems.Clearly,system I,whose bandwidth is three times wider than that of system II,has a faster speed of response and can follow the input much better.  \n\nThe image presents a set of three graphs, each displaying a distinct mathematical function. The functions are:\n\n*   **Graph 1:**\n\n    *   This graph is a logarithmic plot with x-axis ranging from -20 to 0 dB and y-axis ranging from 0 to 1.\n    *   It features two curves labeled I and II, which appear to be identical in shape but differ in scale.\n    *   The curve represents a decaying exponential function, with the amplitude decreasing as the input signal increases.\n*   **Graph 2:**\n\n    *   This graph is a plot of the ratio of the output signal to the input signal against time (t).\n    *   It has a single curve labeled I, which appears to be an exponential decay function.\n    *   The curve shows that the output signal decreases rapidly at first and then slows down as time increases.\n*   **Graph 3:**\n\n    *   This graph is also a plot of the ratio of the output signal to the input signal against time (t).\n    *   It features two curves labeled I and II, which have different shapes.\n    *   The curve represents another exponential decay function, with the amplitude decreasing more slowly than in Graph 2.\n\nIn summary, the image displays three graphs showing different mathematical functions related to signal processing. Each graph has a unique shape and scale, indicating that they represent distinct characteristics of the input signals. 7–77 Comparison of dynamic characteristics of the two systems considered in Example 7–22.

The resonant peak is the value of the maximum magnitude (in decibels) of the closed-loop frequency response.The resonant frequency is the frequency that yields the maximum magnitude. MATLAB commands to be used for obtaining the resonant peak and resonant frequency are as follows:  \n\n[mag,phase,w] $=$ bode(num,den,w); or [mag,phase,w] $=$ bode(sys,w); $[\\mathsf{M}\\mathsf{p},\\mathsf{k}]=\\mathsf{m a x}(\\mathsf{m a g});$   \nresonant_peak $=20^{*}|\\log10(M{\\sf p}),$ ;  \nresonant_frequency $\\prime=\\mathsf{w}(\\mathsf{k})$  \n\nThe bandwidth can be obtained by entering the following lines in the program:  \n\n$\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathsf{n}=1\\,;}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{w h i l e\\ 20^{*}l o g\\,1\\,0(m a g(n))}>=-3\\,;\\,\\mathsf{n}=\\mathsf{n}+1\\,;}\\end{array}$   \nend   \nbandwidth $=\\mathsf{W}(\\mathsf{n})$  \n\nFor a detailed MATLAB program, see Example 7–23.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–23  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 7–78.Using MATLAB,obtain a Bode diagram for the closedloop transfer function. Obtain also the resonant peak, resonant frequency, and bandwidth. MATLAB Program 7–12 produces a Bode diagram for the closed-loop system as well as the resonant peak, resonant frequency, and bandwidth. The resulting Bode diagram is shown in  \n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a MATLAB program, with the title \"MATLAB Program 7-12\" at the top. The program is written in black text on a white background and consists of several lines of code.\n\n*   The first line reads: `nump = [1];`\n    *   This line initializes an array called `nump` with a single element, which is set to 1.\n*   The second line reads: `denp = [0.5 1.5 1 0];`\n    *   This line initializes another array called `denp` with four elements: 0.5, 1.5, 1, and 0.\n*   The third line reads: `sysp = tf(nump, denp);`\n    *   This line creates a transfer function object from the input arrays `nump` and `denp`.\n*   The fourth line reads: `systf = feedback(sysp, 1);`\n    *   This line adds feedforward to the system using a feedback loop with a gain of 1.\n*   The fifth line reads: `resonant_frequency = 0.7906;`\n    *   This line sets the resonant frequency to a value of approximately 0.79 Hz.\n*   The sixth line reads: `n = 1;`\n    *   This line initializes an index variable `n` to 1.\n*   The seventh line reads: `while 20*log10(mag(n)) > -3; n = n + 1; end`\n    *   This line uses a while loop to iterate over the frequency range until the magnitude of the system response is less than or equal to -3 dB.\n*   The eighth line reads: `[mag, phase, w] = bode(sys, w);`\n    *   This line computes the Bode plot for the system using the `bode` function and stores the results in arrays `mag`, `phase`, and `w`.\n*   The ninth line reads: `bandwidth = w(n);`\n    *   This line extracts the bandwidth from the frequency response at index `n`.\n\nOverall, the program appears to be designed to analyze a system's transfer function and extract its resonant frequency and bandwidth.  \n\nFigure 7–78 Closed-loop system.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode Diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: one for magnitude and one for phase.\n\n**Magnitude Plot**\n\n*   The x-axis represents the frequency (in rad/sec), ranging from 10^-1 to 10^1.\n*   The y-axis represents the magnitude in decibels (dB), ranging from -60 to 20 dB.\n*   The plot shows a peak at approximately 0.1 rad/sec, with a magnitude of around 5 dB.\n*   The magnitude decreases as the frequency increases, eventually approaching 0 dB at high frequencies.\n\n**Phase Plot**\n\n*   The x-axis represents the frequency (in rad/sec), ranging from 10^-1 to 10^1.\n*   The y-axis represents the phase in degrees, ranging from -300 to 0 degrees.\n*   The plot shows a linear decrease in phase as the frequency increases, starting at around -90 degrees at low frequencies and approaching 0 degrees at high frequencies.\n\n**Overall**\n\nThe Bode Diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response of a system, showing how the magnitude and phase change with frequency. The diagram can be used to analyze the stability and performance of the system, as well as to design filters and other control systems. 7–79 Bode diagram of the closed-loop transfer function of the system shown in Figure 7–78.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a common representation used to analyze and design control systems. The diagram shows the various components of the system and how they interact with each other.\n\n*   **Input Signal**: The input signal is represented by the variable \"R(s)\".\n*   **Controller**: The controller is represented by the block labeled \"C(s)\". It takes the error between the desired output and actual output as its input and produces an output that drives the system.\n*   **Plant**: The plant is represented by the block labeled \"P(s)\". It is the physical system being controlled, such as a mechanical or electrical device. The plant's dynamics are represented by the transfer function \"1/(0.5s + 1)\".\n*   **Output Signal**: The output signal is represented by the variable \"Y(s)\".\n\nThe diagram shows that the input signal R(s) is fed into the controller C(s), which produces an output that is then fed into the plant P(s). The output of the plant, Y(s), is the final output of the system. The error between the desired output and actual output is calculated by subtracting Y(s) from the desired output.\n\nOverall, the block diagram provides a clear representation of the components and interactions within the control system, allowing for easy analysis and design of the system's performance.  \n\nFigure 7–79.The resonant peak is obtained as 5.2388 dB.The resonant frequency is 0.7906 rad 'sec.   \nThe bandwidth is 1.2649 rad 'sec. These values can be verified from Figure 7–78.  \n\n# 7–8 CLOSED-LOOP FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF UNITYFEEDBACK SYSTEMS  \n\nClosed-Loop Frequency Response. For a stable, unity-feedback closed-loop system, the closed-loop frequency response can be obtained easily from that of the openloop frequency response.

It shows a signal flowing through a system represented by blocks and arrows.\n\n*   The input is denoted as an arrow pointing to the left.\n    *   No specific label is provided for this part of the diagram.\n    *   This could represent any type of input signal, but given the lack of detail, its nature remains unspecified.\n*   A block labeled \"G(s)\" is central to the diagram.\n    *   The term \"G(s)\" typically refers to a transfer function in control systems, where \"s\" represents the Laplace variable used for continuous-time analysis or the Z variable for discrete-time analysis.\n    *   This block signifies a system with an unknown or unspecified transfer function that transforms the input signal according to some rule.\n*   An arrow points from the output of G(s) back to itself in a feedback loop.\n    *   Feedback loops are common in control systems, where part of the system's output is fed back into its input for further processing or correction.\n    *   This configuration could indicate that the system has an element of self-regulation based on its own performance metrics.\n\nIn summary, this block diagram illustrates a basic feedback loop with an unknown transformation applied to the signal by the \"G(s)\" block. The exact nature and purpose of this system cannot be determined without additional context or information about what \"G(s)\" represents in terms of mathematical operations or physical processes it models. 7–80 (a) Unity-feedback system; (b) determination of closed-loop frequency response from open-loop frequency response.   \n(a)  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"Re\" and \"Im\", which appear to represent real and imaginary components of a complex number. The graph features several key elements:\n\n*   **Point P**: A point marked on the graph, located at approximately (0.5, 1) in the Re-Im plane.\n*   **Line G**: A curved line that originates from the origin (0, 0) and passes through Point P.\n*   **Arrow O**: An arrowhead pointing towards the right, positioned near the origin.\n*   **Arrow φ**: An arrowhead pointing upwards, located above the x-axis.\n\nThe graph also includes several mathematical notations:\n\n*   **ω1**: A symbol representing a frequency or angular velocity.\n*   **θ**: An angle measured in radians.\n*   **φ**: Another angle measured in radians.\n*   **Im**: The imaginary component of a complex number.\n*   **Re**: The real component of a complex number.\n\nOverall, the graph appears to be related to signal processing or electrical engineering, possibly illustrating concepts such as frequency response, phase shift, or modulation. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to provide a more specific interpretation.  \n(b)  \n\nThe magnitude of the closed-loop transfer function at tudes of the angle formed by the vectors $\\overrightarrow{O A}$ !to $\\overrightarrow{P A}$ !.

By is the ratio of the magni$\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{1}$ is measuring the magnitude and phase angle at different frequency points, the closed-loop frequency-response curve can be obtained.  \n\nLet us define the magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response as $M$ and the phase angle as $\\alpha$ , or  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(j\\omega)}{R(j\\omega)}=M e^{j\\alpha}\n$$  \n\nIn the following, we shall find the constant-magnitude loci and constant-phase-angle loci. Such loci are convenient in determining the closed-loop frequency response from the polar plot or Nyquist plot.  \n\nConstant-Magnitude Loci ( $M$ circles). To obtain the constant-magnitude loci, let us first note that $G(j\\omega)$ is a complex quantity and can be written as follows:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,X\\,+\\,j Y\n$$  \n\nwhere $X$ and $Y$ are real quantities.Then $M$ is given by  \n\n$$\nM=\\frac{|X+j Y|}{|1+X+j Y|}\n$$  \n\nand $M^{2}$ is  \n\n$$\nM^{2}={\\frac{X^{2}+Y^{2}}{(1\\,+\\,X)^{2}\\,+\\,Y^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nX^{2}(1\\,-\\,M^{2})\\,-\\,2M^{2}X\\,-\\,M^{2}\\,+\\,(1\\,-\\,M^{2})Y^{2}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nIf $M=1$ , then from Equation (7–22), we obtain $X=-{\\frac{1}{2}}$ .This is the equation of a straight line parallel to the $Y$ axis and passing throu int $(-\\frac{1}{2},0)$ .  \n\nIf $M\\ne1$ Equation (7–22) can be written  \n\n$$\nX^{2}+\\frac{2M^{2}}{M^{2}-1}\\,X\\,+\\frac{M^{2}}{M^{2}-1}+\\,Y^{2}=0\n$$  \n\nIf the term $M^{2}/(M^{2}\\mathrm{~-~}1)^{2}$ is added to both sides of this last equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\left(X\\,+\\,\\frac{M^{2}}{M^{2}\\,-\\,1}\\right)^{2}\\,+\\,Y^{2}=\\frac{M^{2}}{\\left(M^{2}\\,-\\,1\\right)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nEquation (7–23 oa circle with center at $X=-M^{2}/(M^{2}\\,-\\,1),Y\\,=\\,0$ and with radius $\\bar{|M/(M^{2}\\ -1)|}$ .  \n\nThe constant Mloci on the $G(s)$ plane are thus a family of circles.The center and radius of the circle for a given value of $M$ can be easily calculated. For example, for $M=1.3$ , the center is at $(-2.45,0)$ and the radius is 1.88. A family of constant $M$ circles is shown in Figure 7–81. It is seen that as $M$ becomes larger compared with 1, the $M$ circles become smaller and converge to the $-1+j0$ point. For $M>1$ , the centers of the $M$ circles lie to the left of the $-1+j0$ point. Similarly, as $M$ becomes smaller compared with 1, the $M$ circle becomes smaller and converges to the origin. For $0<M<1$ ,the centers of the of points equidistant from the origin and from the $M$ circles lie to the right of the origin. A B$-1+j0$ $M=1$ point.As stated earlier, it is corresponds to the locus a straight line passing through the point $\\left(-\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}},0\\right)$ and parallel to the imaginary axis. (The constant $M$ circles corresponding to $M>1$ lie to the left of the $M=1$ line, and those corresponding to $0<M<1$ lie to the right of the $M=1$ line.) The $M$ circles are symmetrical with respect to the straight line corresponding to $M=1$ and with respect to the real axis.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of circular graphs, each representing a distinct mathematical concept. The primary focus is on the central circle, which appears to be an equation with multiple solutions.\n\n*   **Central Circle**\n    *   The central circle is labeled as \"M = 1\" and features several concentric circles.\n    *   Each concentric circle corresponds to a different value of M, ranging from M = 0.4 to M = 5.0.\n    *   The equation for the innermost circle is not explicitly stated but can be inferred based on its position within the larger circle.\n*   **Concentric Circles**\n    *   Each concentric circle represents a different value of M, with the outermost circles having smaller values and the innermost circle having the largest value (M = 5.0).\n    *   The radii of the concentric circles increase as they move outward from the center.\n*   **Curved Lines**\n    *   Several curved lines are present in the image, some of which intersect with the circular graphs.\n    *   These curved lines appear to be part of the equations represented by the circular graphs.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a collection of circular graphs, each representing an equation with multiple solutions. The central circle is labeled as \"M = 1\" and features several concentric circles, while curved lines intersect with these circular graphs. 7–81 A family of constant $M$ circles.  \n\nConstant-Phase-Angle Loci ( $N$ Circles). We shall obtain the phase angle $\\alpha$ in terms of $X$ and $Y$ . Since  \n\n$$\n\\Big/e^{j\\alpha}=\\;\\Bigg/\\frac{X\\,+\\,j Y}{1\\,+\\,X\\,+\\,j Y}\n$$  \n\nthe phase angle $\\alpha$ is  \n\n$$\n\\alpha=\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{Y}{X}}\\right)\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{Y}{1\\,+\\,X}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nIf we define  \n\n$$\n\\tan\\alpha\\,=\\,N\n$$  \n\nthen  \n\n$$\nN=\\tan\\!\\left[\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{Y}{X}}\\right)\\,-\\,\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left({\\frac{Y}{1\\,+\\,X}}\\right)\\right]\n$$  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\tan(A\\,-\\,B)={\\frac{\\tan A\\,-\\,\\tan B}{1\\,+\\,\\tan A\\tan B}}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\nN={\\frac{{\\cfrac{Y}{X}}-{\\cfrac{Y}{1+X}}}{1+{\\cfrac{Y}{X}}\\left({\\cfrac{Y}{1+X}}\\right)}}={\\frac{Y}{X^{2}+X+Y^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nX^{2}\\,+\\,X\\,+\\,Y^{2}\\,-\\,{\\frac{1}{N}}\\,Y\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe addition of $\\textstyle{\\left({\\frac{1}{4}}\\right)}\\,+\\,1/(2N)^{2}$ to both sides of this last equation yields  \n\n$$\n\\left(X+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\left(Y\\,-{\\frac{1}{2N}}\\right)^{2}={\\frac{1}{4}}+\\left({\\frac{1}{2N}}\\right)^{2}\n$$  \n\nThis is an equation of a circle with center at $X=-{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ,$Y\\,=\\,1/(2N)$ and with radius $\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{4}}\\,+\\,1/(2N)^{2}}$ .For example, if $\\alpha=30^{\\circ}$ , then $N\\,=\\,\\tan\\alpha\\,=\\,0.577$ , and the center and the radius of the circle corresponding to $\\alpha=30^{\\circ}$ are found to be $(-0.5,0.866)$ and unity, respectively. Since Equation (7–24) is satisfied when $X=Y=0$ and $X=-1$ ,$Y=0$ regardless of the value of $N$ , each circle passes through the origin and the $-1+j0$ point. The constant $\\alpha$ loci can be drawn easily,once the value of $N$ is given.A family of constant $N$ circles is shown in Figure 7–82 with $\\alpha$ as a parameter.  \n\nIt should be noted that the constant $N$ locus for a given value of $\\alpha$ is actually not the entire circle, but only an arc. In other words, the $\\alpha=30^{\\circ}$ and $\\alpha=-150^{\\circ}$ arcs are parts of the same circle.This is so because the tangent of an angle remains the same if $\\pm180^{\\circ}$ (or multiples thereof) is added to the angle.  \n\nThe use of the $M$ and $N$ circles enables us to find the entire closed-loop frequency response from the open-loop frequency response $G(j\\omega)$ without calculating the magnitude and phase of the closed-loop transfer function at each frequency.The intersections of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus and the $M$ circles and $N$ circles give the values of $M$ and $N$ at frequency points on the $G(j\\omega)$ locus.  \n\nThe image presents a diagram of a graph with multiple circles and lines, set against a white background. The overall design is simple yet effective in conveying information.\n\n*   **Background:**\n    *   The background is plain white.\n    *   No shadows or gradients are present.\n    *   The focus remains on the geometric shapes within the image.\n*   **Geometric Shapes:**\n    *   Multiple circles of varying sizes are drawn in black ink.\n    *   Each circle has a distinct diameter and radius.\n    *   Some circles overlap, while others do not intersect with each other.\n    *   The circles are evenly spaced and appear to be arranged in a pattern or grid.\n*   **Lines:**\n    *   Thin black lines connect the centers of some of the circles to specific points on the circumference of adjacent circles.\n    *   These lines may represent radii or tangents, but their exact purpose is unclear without additional context.\n    *   The lines are straight and unadorned, adding to the overall simplicity of the design.\n*   **Labels:**\n    *   Small numbers in a sans-serif font are placed near each circle's center, likely indicating the diameter or radius of that particular circle.\n    *   These labels are concise and easy to read, contributing to the clarity of the diagram.\n    *   No labels explain the purpose of the lines connecting the circles' centers.\n\nIn summary, the image features a collection of circles and lines against a clean white background. While the exact meaning behind these geometric elements is unclear without additional context or explanation, their arrangement suggests an exploration of spatial relationships and patterns within a two-dimensional space. 7–82 A family of constant $N$ circles.  \n\nThe $N$ circles are multivalued in the sense that the circle for $\\alpha\\,=\\,\\alpha_{1}$ and that for $\\alpha\\,=\\,\\alpha_{1}\\pm180^{\\circ}n$ $\\langle n=1,2,\\ldots\\rangle$ )are the same. In using the $N$ circles for the determination of the phase angle of closed-loop systems, we must interpret the proper value of $\\alpha$ . To avoid any error, start at zero frequency, which corresponds to $\\alpha=0^{\\circ}$ , and proceed to higher frequencies.The phase-angle curve must be continuous.  \n\nGraphically, the intersections of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus and $M$ circles give the values of $M$ at the frequencies denoted on the $G(j\\omega)$ locus. Thus, the constant $M$ circle with the smallest radius that is tangent to the $G(j\\omega)$ locus gives the value of the resonant peak magnitude $M_{r}$ . If it is desired to keep the resonant peak value less than a certain value, then the system should not enclose the critical point $\\langle-1+j0$ point )and, at the same time, there should be no intersections with the particular $M$ circle and the $G(j\\omega)$ locus.  \n\nFigure 7–83(a) shows the $G(j\\omega)$ locus superimposed on a family of $M$ circles. Figure 7–83(b) shows the $G(j\\omega)$ locus superimposed on a family of $N$ circles. From these plots, it is possible to obtain the closed-loop frequency response by inspection. It is seen that the $M=1.1$ circle intersects the $G(j\\omega)$ locus at frequency point $\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{1}$ . This means that at this frequency the magnitude of the closed-loop transfer function is 1.1. In Figure 7–83(a), the $M=2$ circle is just tangent to the $\\mathrm{G}(j\\omega)$ locus.Thus, there is only one point on th $G(j\\omega)$ locus for which $\\left|C(j\\omega)/R(j\\omega)\\right|$ is equal t 2. Figure 7–83(c) ws the closed-loop frequency-response curve for the system.The upper curve is the M-versusfrequency $\\omega$ curve, and the lower curve is the phase angle $\\alpha$ -versus-frequency $\\omega$ curve.  \n\nThe resonant peak value is the value of $M$ corresponding to the $M$ circle of smallest radius that is tangent to the $G(j\\omega)$ locus.Thus, in the Nyquist diagram, the resonant peak value $M_{r}$ and the resonant frequency $\\omega_{r}$ can be found from the $M$ -circle tangency to the $G(j\\omega)$ locus. (In the present example, $M_{r}=2$ and $\\omega_{r}\\,=\\,\\omega_{4}$ .)  \n\nThe image displays a set of three graphs, all related to complex functions. \n\n*   The top-left graph is a polar plot with multiple circles, each representing the magnitude and phase angle of different frequencies.\n    *   The radius of each circle corresponds to the amplitude of the frequency response, while the angle represents the phase shift.\n    *   There are several lines connecting the origin (0 Hz) to various points on the graph, indicating how the system's behavior changes with increasing frequency.\n*   The top-right graph shows a similar plot but with a different set of frequencies. \n    *   This graph appears to be related to the same problem as the left-hand side, possibly showing the response for another frequency or input condition.\n*   The bottom graph is a Bode plot, which displays both magnitude and phase response on separate axes. \n    *   The magnitude response (logarithmic scale) shows how the system's gain changes with frequency.\n    *   The phase response (linear scale) indicates the phase shift introduced by the system at different frequencies.\n\nOverall, these graphs likely represent the frequency response of a system or filter, showing how it responds to various inputs across different frequencies. 7–83 (a) $G(j\\omega)$ locus superimposed on a family of $M$ circles; (b) $G(j\\omega)$ locus superimposed on a family of $N$ circles; (c) closed-loop frequency-response curves.  \n\nNichols Chart. In dealing with design problems, we find it convenient to construct the $M$ and $N$ loci in the log-magnitude-versus-phase plane. The chart consisting of the $M$ and $N$ loci in the log-magnitude-versus-phase diagram is called the Nichols chart. The $G(j\\omega)$ locus drawn on the Nichols chart gives both the gain characteristics and phase characteristics of the closed-loop transfer function at the same time.The Nichols chart is shown in Figure 7–84, for phase angles between $0^{\\circ}$ and $-240^{\\circ}$ .  \n\nNote that the critical point ($-1+j0$ point )is mapped to the Nichols chart as the point $(0\\,\\mathrm{dB},-180^{\\circ})$ . The Nichols chart contains curves of constant closed-loop magnitude and phase angle. The designer can graphically determine the phase margin, gain margin, resonant peak magnitude, resonant frequency, and bandwidth of the closedloop system from the plot of the open-loop locus, $G(j\\omega)$ .  \n\nThe Nichols chart is symmetric about the $-180^{\\circ}$ axis. The $M$ and $N$ loci repeat for every $360^{\\circ}$ , and there is symmetry at every $180^{\\circ}$ interval.The $M$ loci are centered about the critical point $(0\\,\\mathrm{dB},-180^{\\circ})$ .The Nichols chart is useful for determining the frequency response of the closed loop from that of the open loop. If the open-loop frequency-response curve is superimposed on the Nichols chart, the intersections of the open-loop frequency-response curve $G(j\\omega)$ and the $M$ and $N$ loci give the values of the magnitude $M$ and phase angle $\\alpha$ of the closed-loop frequency response at each frequency point. If the $G(j\\omega)$ locus does not intersect the $M=M_{r}$ locus, but is tangent to it, then the resonant peak value of $M$ of the closed-loop frequency response is given by $M_{r}$ .The resonant frequency is given by the frequency at the point of tangency.  \n\nAs an example, consider the unity-feedback system with the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(0.5s\\,+\\,1)},\\qquad K\\,=\\,1\n$$  \n\nTo find the closed-loop frequency response by use of the Nichols chart, the $G(j\\omega)$ locus is constructed in the log-magnitude-versus-phase plane by use of MATLAB or from the Bode diagram.Figure 7–85(a) shows the $G(j\\omega)$ locus together with the $M$ and $N$ loci. The closed-loop frequency-response curves may be constructed by reading the magnitudes and phase angles at various frequency points on the $G(j\\omega)$ locus from the $M$ and $N$ loci, as shown in Figure 7–85(b). Since the largest magnitude contour touched by the $G(j\\omega)$ locus is $5\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ , the resonant peak magnitude $M_{r}$ is 5 dB. The corresponding resonant peak frequency is 0.8 rad 'sec.  \n\nThe image presents a complex chart that displays various mathematical relationships between two variables, with multiple axes and lines intersecting to form a grid-like pattern. The purpose of this chart is likely to facilitate calculations or provide visualizations for certain mathematical operations.\n\n*   **Axes**\n    *   There are three axes in the chart: x-axis (bottom), y-axis (left), and z-axis (not visible).\n        *   The x-axis has numbers ranging from -240° to 0°.\n        *   The y-axis has numbers ranging from -16 dB to 36 dB.\n*   **Curved Lines**\n    *   Multiple curved lines of different colors intersect the grid, forming a series of closed loops.\n        *   These curves are likely representing mathematical functions or relationships between the variables being plotted.\n*   **Grid Pattern**\n    *   The chart features a grid pattern with both horizontal and vertical lines.\n        *   This grid is composed of fine dashes along the edges of the large squares, providing a detailed scale for measurements.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a complex chart that plots multiple mathematical relationships between two variables on a grid. The chart has three axes (x, y, and z), with visible ranges from -240° to 0° on the x-axis and -16 dB to 36 dB on the y-axis. Multiple curved lines of different colors intersect the grid, forming closed loops that represent mathematical functions or relationships between the variables being plotted. The chart's purpose is likely to facilitate calculations or provide visualizations for certain mathematical operations. 7–84 Nichols chart.  \n\nNotice that the phase crossover point is the point where the $G(j\\omega)$ locus intersects the $-180^{\\circ}$ axis (for the present system, $\\omega=1.4$ rad 'sec), and the gain crossover point is the point where the locus intersects the 0-dB axis (for the present system, $\\omega\\,=\\,0.76\\;\\mathrm{rad/sec})$ ). The phase margin is the horizontal distance (measured in degrees) between the gain crossover point and the critical point $(0\\,\\mathrm{dB},-180^{\\circ})$ . The gain margin is the distance (in decibels) between the phase crossover point and the critical point.  \n\nThe bandwidth of the closed-loop system can easily be found from the $G(j\\omega)$ locus in the Nichols diagram. The frequency at the intersection of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus and the $M=-3$ dB locus gives the bandwidth.  \n\nIf the open-loop gain $K$ is varied, the shape of the $G(j\\omega)$ locus in the log-magnitudeversus-phase diagram remains the same, but it is shifted up (for increasing $K$ ) or down (for decreasing $K$ ) along the vertical axis. Therefore, the $G(j\\omega)$ locus intersects the $M$ and $N$ loci differently, resulting in a different closed-loop frequency-response curve. For a small value of the gain $K$ ,the $G(j\\omega)$ locus will not be tangent to any of the $M$ loci,which means that there is no resonance in the closed-loop frequency response.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of two distinct signal processing techniques, each with its own set of graphs and charts. The visual contents are organized into two main sections: **(a)** and **(b)**.\n\n**Section (a) - Bode Plot**\n\n*   A Bode plot is displayed in the top-left corner of the image.\n*   The x-axis represents frequency, while the y-axis represents gain or magnitude.\n*   The plot consists of multiple lines with varying slopes and intercepts, indicating different frequency response characteristics.\n\n**Section (b) - Graphical Analysis**\n\n*   A graphical analysis is presented in the bottom-right corner of the image.\n*   The graph features a series of curves with varying shapes and amplitudes, representing different signal processing techniques.\n*   Each curve has a distinct label or annotation, likely indicating specific parameters or characteristics.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the image provides a detailed comparison of two signal processing techniques using Bode plots and graphical analyses. The visual contents offer valuable insights into the frequency response and amplitude characteristics of each technique, allowing for a thorough understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. 7–85 (a) Plot of $G(j\\omega)$ superimposed on Nichols chart; (b) closed-loop frequency-response curves.  \n\nConsider the unity-feedback control system whose open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\frac{K}{j\\omega(1\\,+\\,j\\omega)}\n$$  \n\nDetermine the value of the gain $K$ so that $M_{r}=1.4$ .The first step in the determination of the gain $K$ is to sketch the polar plot of  \n\n$$\n\\frac{G(j\\omega)}{K}=\\frac{1}{j\\omega(1\\,+\\,j\\omega)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–86 shows the $M_{r}=1.4$ locus and the $G(j\\omega)/K$ locus. Changing the gain has no effect on the phase angle, but merely moves the curve vertically up for $K>1$ and down for $K<1$ .  \n\nIn Figure 7–86, the $G(j\\omega)/K$ locus must be raised by 4 dB in order that it be tangent to the desired $M_{r}$ locus and that the entire $G(j\\omega)/K$ locus be outside the $M_{r}=1.4$ locus.The amount of vertical shift of the $G(j\\omega)/K$ locus determines the gain necessary to yield the desired value of $M_{r}$ .Thus, by solving  \n\n$$\n20\\log K=4\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\nK=1.59\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, featuring several curves and lines. The purpose of this graph is to illustrate various mathematical functions or relationships between different variables.\n\n* A graph with two axes:\n\t+ The x-axis represents a variable labeled as \"G(jω)\".\n\t+ The y-axis represents another variable labeled as \"|G| in dB\".\n* Multiple curved lines on the graph:\n\t+ One curve starts at approximately (10, -5) and ends at (-10, 15).\n\t+ Another curve begins around (-20, -30) and terminates near (20, 25).\n\t+ A third curve originates from about (-40, -50) and extends to almost (-60, 0).\n* Various mathematical equations and formulas:\n\t+ The equation \"G(jω)\" is written above the graph.\n\t+ An arrow points to a formula labeled as \"M_r = 1.4\".\n\t+ Another arrow indicates an equation labeled as \"20 log K = 4\".\n\nThe graph displays multiple curves that intersect or diverge, illustrating different mathematical functions. The equations and formulas provided offer additional context for understanding the relationships between the variables represented by the curves.  \n\nFigure 7–86   \nDetermination of the gain $K$ using the   \nNichols chart.  \n\nThe first step in the analysis and design of a control system is to derive a mathematical model of the plant under consideration.Obtaining a model analytically may be quite difficult.We may have to obtain it by means of experimental analysis.The importance of the frequency-response methods is that the transfer function of the plant, or any other component of a system, may be determined by simple frequency-response measurements.  \n\nIf the amplitude ratio and phase shift have been measured at a sufficient number of frequencies within the frequency range of interest, they may be plotted on the Bode diagram.Then the transfer function can be determined by asymptotic approximations.We build up asymptotic log-magnitude curves consisting of several segments. With some trial-and-error juggling of the corner frequencies, it is usually possible to find a very close fit to the curve. (Note that if the frequency is plotted in cycles per second rather than radians per second, the corner frequencies must be converted to radians per second before computing the time constants.)  \n\nSinusoidal-Signal Generators. In performing a frequency-response test, suitable sinusoidal-signal generators must be available. The signal may have to be in mechanical, electrical, or pneumatic form. The frequency ranges needed for the test are approximately 0.001 to $10\\;\\mathrm{Hz}$ for large-time-constant systems and 0.1 to $1000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ for small-time-constant systems. The sinusoidal signal must be reasonably free from harmonics or distortion.  \n\nFor very low frequency ranges (below $0.01\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ ), a mechanical signal generator (together with a suitable pneumatic or electrical transducer if necessary) may be used. For the frequency range from 0.01 to $1000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ , a suitable electrical-signal generator (together with a suitable transducer if necessary) may be used.  \n\nDetermination of Minimum-Phase Transfer Functions from Bode Diagrams. As stated previously, whether a system is minimum phase can be determined from the frequency-response curves by examining the high-frequency characteristics.  \n\nTo determine the transfer function, we first draw asymptotes to the experimentally obtained log-magnitude curve. The asymptotes must have slopes of multiples of $\\pm20$ dB 'decade. If the slope of the experimentally obtained log-magnitude curve changes from $-20$ to $-40$ dB 'decade at $\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{1}$ , it is c that a factor $1\\bar{/}[1\\,+\\,j(\\omega/\\omega_{1})]$ exists in the transfer function. If the slope changes by $-40$ dB 'decade at $\\omega=\\omega_{2}$ , there must be a quadratic factor of the form  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\!\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{2}}\\right)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{2}}\\right)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nin the transfer function. The undamped natural frequency of this quadratic factor is equal to the corner frequency $\\omega_{2}$ . The damping ratio $\\zeta$ can be determined from the experimentally obtained log-magnitude curve by measuring the amount of resonant peak near the corner frequency $\\omega_{2}$ and comparing this with the curves shown in Figure 7–9.  \n\nOnce the factors of the transfer function $G(j\\omega)$ have been determined, the gain can be determined from the low-frequency portion of the log-magnitude curve. Since such terms as $1\\,+\\,j(\\omega/\\omega_{1})$ and $1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\!\\left(j\\omega/\\omega_{2}\\right)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\omega/\\omega_{2}\\right)^{2}$ become unity as $\\omega$ approaches zero, at very low frequencies the sinusoidal transfer function $G(j\\omega)$ can be written  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\rightarrow0}G(j\\omega)=\\frac{K}{(j\\omega)^{\\lambda}}\n$$  \n\nIn many practical systems, $\\lambda$ equals $0,1$ , or 2.  \n\n1. For $\\lambda=0$ , or type 0 systems,  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,K,\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\omega\\,\\ll\\,1\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\bigl|G(j\\omega)\\bigr|\\,=\\,20\\log K,\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\omega\\,\\ll\\,1\n$$  \n\nThe low-frequency asymptote is a horizontal line at $20\\log K$ dB. The value of $K$ can thus be found from this horizontal asymptote.  \n\n2. For $\\lambda=1$ , or type 1 systems,  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{K}{j\\omega},~~~~~\\mathrm{for}\\;\\omega\\;\\ll\\;1\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|{\\cal G}(j\\omega)\\right|\\,=\\,20\\log K\\,-\\,20\\log\\omega,\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\omega\\,\\ll\\,1\n$$  \n\nwhich indicates that the low-frequency asymptote has the slope $-20$ dB 'decade. The frequency at which the low-frequency asymptote (or its extension) intersects the 0-dB line is numerically equal to $K$ .  \n\n3. For $\\lambda=2$ , or type 2 systems,  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{K}{(j\\omega)^{2}},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mathrm{for}\\;\\omega\\,\\ll\\,1\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n20\\log\\left|{\\cal G}(j\\omega)\\right|\\,=\\,20\\log K\\,-\\,40\\log\\omega,\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,\\omega\\,\\ll\\,1\n$$  \n\nThe slope of the low-frequency asymptote is $-40~\\mathrm{dB}$ 'decade. The frequency at which this asymptote (or its extension) intersects the 0-dB line is numerically equal to $\\sqrt{K}$ .  \n\nExamples of log-magnitude curves for type 0, type 1, and type 2 systems are shown in Figure 7–87, together with the frequency to which the gain $K$ is related.  \n\nThe experimentally obtained phase-angle curve provides a means of checking the transfer function obtained from the log-magnitude curve. For a minimum-phase system, the experimental phase-angle curve should agree reasonably well with the theoretical phase-angle curve obtained from the transfer function just determined.These two phaseangle curves should agree exactly in both the very low and very high frequency ranges. If the experimentally obtained phase angle at very high frequencies (compared with the corner frequencies) is not equal to $-90^{\\circ}(q\\mathrm{~-~}p)$ ,where $p$ and $q$ are the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials of the transfer function, respectively, then the transfer function must be a nonminimum-phase transfer function.  \n\nThis image features four graphs with the same layout, each comprising a line graph and accompanying text. The top two graphs are labeled \"a\" and \"b\", while the bottom two graphs are labeled \"c\". Each graph's x-axis is labeled \"ω in log scale\" (Greek omega), and its y-axis is labeled \"dB\" (decibel). Notably, all four graphs share identical labeling on their axes.\n\nThe top left graph, labeled \"a\", features a logarithmic plot of a curve with one peak. The top right graph, also labeled \"b\", displays two curves connected by an arrow. In contrast, the bottom left and bottom right graphs, both labeled \"c\", appear to be variations of the same line graph, albeit with different labels.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the lack of additional information about the context or purpose of these graphs, it is unclear what they represent. Nevertheless, they are visually striking and may serve as a starting point for further investigation. 7–87 (a) Log-magnitude curve of a type 0 system; (b) logmagnitude curves of type 1 systems; (c) log-magnitude curves of type 2 systems. (The slopes shown are in dB 'decade.)  \n\nNonminimum-Phase Transfer Functions. If,at the high-frequency end,the computed phase lag is $180^{\\circ}$ less than the experimentally obtained phase lag, then one of the zeros of the transfer function should have been in the right-half $s$ plane instead of the left-half $s$ plane.  \n\nIf the computed phase lag differed from the experimentally obtained phase lag by a constant rate of change of phase,then transport lag,or dead time,is present.If we assume the transfer function to be of the form  \n\n$$\nG(s)e^{-T s}\n$$  \n\nwhere $G(s)$ is a ratio of two polynomials in $s$ , then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\underset{\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\operatorname*{lim}}\\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\,\\frac{\\displaystyle{d}}{\\displaystyle{d}\\omega}\\frac{\\displaystyle{d}(j\\omega)e^{-j\\omega T}}{\\displaystyle{d}\\omega}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\big[\\frac{\\displaystyle{d}(j\\omega)}{\\displaystyle{d}\\omega}+\\,\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\big/}e^{-j\\omega T}}{\\displaystyle{d}\\omega}\\big]}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad=\\,\\underset{\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\operatorname*{lim}}\\frac{d}{d\\omega}\\big[\\frac{\\displaystyle{d}(j\\omega)}{\\displaystyle{d}\\omega}-\\,\\omega T\\big]}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad=\\,0\\,-\\,T=-T}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere we used the fact that $\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to\\infty}\\underline{{\\langle G(j\\omega)\\rangle}}=$ constant. Thus, from this last equation, we can evaluate the magnitude of the transport lag $T$ .  \n\n# A Few Remarks on the Experimental Determination of Transfer Functions  \n\n2. The frequency response of measuring equipment used to measure the system output must have a nearly flat magnitude-versus-frequency curve. In addition, the phase angle must be nearly proportional to the frequency.  \n\n3. Physical systems may have several kinds of nonlinearities. Therefore, it is necessary to consider carefully the amplitude of input sinusoidal signals. If the amplitude of the input signal is too large, the system will saturate, and the frequency-response test will yield inaccurate results. On the other hand, a small signal will cause errors due to dead zone. Hence, a careful choice of the amplitude of the input sinusoidal signal must be made. It is necessary to sample the waveform of the system output to make sure that the waveform is sinusoidal and that the system is operating in the linear region during the test period. (The waveform of the system output is not sinusoidal when the system is operating in its nonlinear region.)  \n\n4. If the system under consideration is operating continuously for days and weeks, then normal operation need not be stopped for frequency-response tests. The sinusoidal test signal may be superimposed on the normal inputs.Then,for linear systems, the output due to the test signal is superimposed on the normal output. For the determination of the transfer function while the system is in normal operation, stochastic signals (white noise signals) also are often used. By use of correlation functions, the transfer function of the system can be determined without interrupting normal operation.  \n\nDetermine the transfer function of the system whose experimental frequency-response curves are as shown in Figure 7–88.  \n\nThe first step in determining the transfer function is to approximate the log-magnitude curve by asymptotes with slopes $\\pm20$ dB 'decade and multiples thereof, as shown in Figure 7–88. We then estimate the corner frequencies. For the system shown in Figure 7–88, the following form of the transfer function is estimated:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\frac{K(1\\,+\\,0.5j\\omega)}{j\\omega(1\\,+\\,j\\omega)\\bigg[1\\,+\\,2\\zeta\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{8}\\bigg)\\,+\\,\\bigg(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{8}\\bigg)^{2}\\bigg]}\n$$  \n\nThe value of the damping ratio $\\zeta$ is estimated by examining the peak resonance near $\\omega=6\\,\\mathrm{rad/sec}.$ Referring to Figure $7{-}9,\\zeta$ is determined to be 0.5.The gain $K$ is numerically equal to the frequency at the intersection of the extension of the low-frequency asymptote that has $20\\,\\mathrm{dB}.$ /decade slope and the 0-dB line.The value of $K$ is thus found to be 10.Therefore, $G(j\\omega)$ is tentatively determined as  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{10(1+0.5j\\omega)}{j\\omega(1\\,+\\,j\\omega)\\bigg[1+\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{8}\\right)\\,+\\,\\left(j\\,\\frac{\\omega}{8}\\right)^{2}\\bigg]}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\frac{320(s\\,+\\,2)}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s^{2}\\,+\\,8s\\,+\\,64)}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with multiple lines and curves, accompanied by labels and annotations. The graph appears to be a frequency response plot, likely used in control systems or signal processing applications.\n\n*   **Graph Structure:**\n    *   The graph features several lines and curves, each representing different aspects of the system's behavior.\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency (in rad/sec), while the y-axis represents magnitude (in dB).\n    *   The graph is divided into two main sections: one for the magnitude response and another for the phase angle.\n*   **Magnitude Response:**\n    *   The magnitude response curve shows a peak at around 1 rad/sec, indicating resonance in the system.\n    *   The curve then rolls off smoothly as frequency increases, with a slope of approximately -20 dB/decade.\n*   **Phase Angle:**\n    *   The phase angle curve starts at around 0° at low frequencies and gradually decreases to around -180° at high frequencies.\n    *   There is a sharp drop in phase angle between 10 rad/sec and 100 rad/sec, indicating a significant change in system behavior.\n*   **Annotations:**\n    *   Various annotations are scattered throughout the graph, including labels for magnitude, phase angle, and frequency ranges.\n    *   Arrows point to specific points on the curves, highlighting important features such as resonance peaks or sharp changes in phase angle.\n*   **Overall Impression:**\n    *   The graph provides a detailed view of the system's frequency response, allowing analysts to identify key characteristics such as resonance frequencies and phase shift behavior.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a comprehensive frequency response plot that showcases various aspects of a system's behavior. By analyzing the different curves and annotations, engineers can gain valuable insights into the system's performance and make informed decisions about its design or optimization. 7–88 Bode diagram of a system. (Solid curves are experimentally obtained curves.)  \n\nThis transfer function is tentative because we have not examined the phase-angle curve yet.  \n\nOnce the corner frequencies are noted on the log-magnitude curve, the corresponding phaseangle curve for each component factor of the transfer function can easily be drawn.The sum of these component phase-angle curves is that of the assumed transfer function. The phase-angle curve for $G(j\\omega)$ is denoted by $\\underline{{\\boldsymbol{\\langle G\\rangle}}}$ in Figure 7–88. From Figure 7–88, we clearly notice a discrepancy between the computed phase-angle curve and the experimentally obtained phaseangle curve. The difference between the two curves at very high frequencies appears to be a constant rate of change. Thus, the discrepancy in the phase-angle curves must be caused by transport lag.  \n\nHence, we assume the complete transfer function to be $G(s)e^{-T s}$ . Since the discrepancy between the computed and experimental phase angles is $-0.2\\omega$ rad for very high frequencies, we can determine the value of $T$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\frac{d}{d\\omega}}\\,\\Big[G(j\\omega)e^{-j\\omega T}=-T=-0.2\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nT\\,=\\,0.2\\;\\mathrm{sec.}\n$$  \n\nThe presence of transport lag can thus be determined, and the complete transfer function determined from the experimental curves is  \n\n$$\nG(s)e^{-T s}=\\frac{320(s+2)e^{-0.2s}}{s(s+1)(s^{2}+8s\\,+\\,64)}\n$$  \n\nIn Chapter 6 we presented root-locus analysis and design. The root-locus method was shown to be very useful to reshape the transient-response characteristics of closedloop control systems. The root-locus approach gives us direct information on the transient response of the closed-loop system.The frequency-response approach,on the other hand, gives us this information only indirectly. However, as we shall see in the remaining three sections of this chapter, the frequency-response approach is very useful in designing control systems.  \n\nFor any design problem,the designer will do well to use both approaches to the design and choose the compensator that most closely produces the desired closed-loop response.  \n\nIn most control systems design, transient-response performance is usually very important. In the frequency-response approach, we specify the transient-response performance in an indirect manner.That is, the transient-response performance is specified in terms of the phase margin, gain margin, resonant peak magnitude (they give a rough estimate of the system damping);the gain crossover frequency,resonant frequency,bandwidth (they give a rough estimate of the speed of transient response); and static error constants (they give the steady-state accuracy). Although the correlation between the transient response and frequency response is indirect, the frequency-domain specifications can be easily met in the Bode diagram approach.  \n\nAfter the open loop has been designed, the closed-loop poles and zeros can be determined.Then, the transient-response characteristics must be checked to see whether the designed system satisfies the requirements in the time domain. If it does not, then the compensator must be modified and the analysis repeated until a satisfactory result is obtained.  \n\nDesign in the frequency domain is simple and straightforward. The frequencyresponse plot indicates clearly the manner in which the system should be modified, although the exact quantitative prediction of the transient-response characteristics cannot be made. The frequency-response approach can be applied to systems or components whose dynamic characteristics are given in the form of frequency-response data. Note that because of difficulty in deriving the equations governing certain components, such as pneumatic and hydraulic components, the dynamic characteristics of such components are usually determined experimentally through frequency-response tests.The experimentally obtained frequency-response plots can be combined easily with other such plots when the Bode diagram approach is used. Note also that in dealing with highfrequency noises we find that the frequency-response approach is more convenient than other approaches.  \n\nThere are basically two approaches in the frequency-domain design. One is the polar plot approach and the other is the Bode diagram approach. When a compensator is added, the polar plot does not retain the original shape, and, therefore, we need to draw a new polar plot,which will take time and is thus inconvenient.On the other hand,a Bode diagram of the compensator can be simply added to the original Bode diagram, and thus plotting the complete Bode diagram is a simple matter.Also, if the open-loop gain is varied, the magnitude curve is shifted up or down without changing the slope of the curve, and the phase curve remains the same. For design purposes, therefore, it is best to work with the Bode diagram.  \n\nA common approach to the design based on the Bode diagram is that we first adjust the open-loop gain so that the requirement on the steady-state accuracy is met.Then the magnitude and phase curves of the uncompensated open loop (with the open-loop gain just adjusted) are plotted. If the specifications on the phase margin and gain margin are not satisfied, then a suitable compensator that will reshape the open-loop transfer function is determined. Finally, if there are any other requirements to be met, we try to satisfy them, unless some of them are mutually contradictory.  \n\nInformation Obtainable from Open-Loop Frequency Response. The lowfrequency region (the region far below the gain crossover frequency) of the locus indicates the steady-state behavior of the closed-loop system.The medium-frequency region (the region near the gain crossover frequency) of the locus indicates relative stability. The high-frequency region (the region far above the gain crossover frequency) indicates the complexity of the system.  \n\nRequirements on Open-Loop Frequency Response. We might say that,in many practical cases, compensation is essentially a compromise between steady-state accuracy and relative stability.  \n\nTo have a high value of the velocity error constant and yet satisfactory relative stability, we find it necessary to reshape the open-loop frequency-response curve.  \n\nThe gain in the low-frequency region should be large enough, and near the gain crossover frequency, the slope of the log-magnitude curve in the Bode diagram should be $-20$ dB 'decade.This slope should extend over a sufficiently wide frequency band to assure a proper phase margin. For the high-frequency region, the gain should be attenuated as rapidly as possible to minimize the effects of noise.  \n\nExamples of generally desirable and undesirable open-loop and closed-loop frequency-response curves are shown in Figure 7–89.  \n\nReferring to Figure 7–90, we see that the reshaping of the open-loop frequencyresponse curve may be done if the high-frequency portion of the locus follows the $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ locus,while the low-frequency portion of the locus follows the $G_{2}(j\\omega)$ locus.The reshaped locus $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ should have reasonable phase and gain margins or should be tangent to a proper $M$ circle, as shown.  \n\nThe image presents two graphs, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to be related to signal processing or control theory. The purpose of these graphs is likely to illustrate the relationship between different variables and their desirable characteristics.\n\n*   **Graph (a)**:\n    *   This graph features a plot with an x-axis labeled \"Re\" and a y-axis labeled \"Im\".\n    *   There are two curves: one solid line labeled \"Desirable\" and another dashed line labeled \"Undesirable\".\n    *   The curve labeled \"Desirable\" is closer to the origin (0, 0) in the first quadrant, while the curve labeled \"Undesirable\" extends further away from the origin.\n    *   There are no additional features or annotations on this graph.\n*   **Graph (b)**:\n    *   This graph has a plot with an x-axis labeled \"Log ω\" and a y-axis labeled \"dB\".\n    *   Two curves are shown: one solid line labeled \"Desirable\" and another dashed line labeled \"Undesirable\".\n    *   The curve labeled \"Desirable\" is positioned closer to the origin (0, 0) compared to the curve labeled \"Undesirable\", which has a more significant magnitude.\n    *   There are no additional features or annotations on this graph.\n\nIn summary, both graphs display two curves representing different characteristics: one desirable and one undesirable. The graphs illustrate how these characteristics vary in relation to their respective axes, with the desirable curves generally positioned closer to the origin than the undesirable ones. However, without further context or information about what specific quantities are being measured, it is challenging to provide a more detailed interpretation of these graphs. 7–89 (a) Examples of desirable and undesirable open-loop frequency-response curves; (b) examples of desirable and undesirable closed-loop frequency-response curves.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two circles and several lines, accompanied by labels and symbols. The graph is set against a white background.\n\n*   **Circles:**\n    *   There are two circles on the graph.\n        *   One circle is labeled \"M Circle\" and has a radius of 1 unit.\n        *   The other circle is not explicitly labeled but appears to have a radius of approximately 0.5 units.\n    *   Both circles intersect at two points, one in each quadrant.\n*   **Lines:**\n    *   There are several lines on the graph, including:\n        *   A horizontal line that intersects both circles at their centers (x=1 and x=-1).\n        *   Two vertical lines that pass through the center of each circle (y=0).\n        *   Several other lines that intersect the circles at various points.\n*   **Labels:**\n    *   The graph includes several labels:\n        *   \"M Circle\" is written above the larger circle.\n        *   Other labels are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text but can be inferred from the context of the graph.\n*   **Symbols:**\n    *   Several symbols are used on the graph, including:\n        *   G1(jω) and G2(jω), which appear to represent frequency response functions or transfer functions.\n        *   Gc(jω)G(jω), which may represent a closed-loop system or feedback mechanism.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts two circles with intersecting lines and labels, suggesting a graph of frequency responses or system dynamics. The exact meaning and context of the graph cannot be determined without additional information or clarification. 7–90 Reshaping of the open-loop frequency-response curve.  \n\nBasic Characteristics of Lead, Lag, and Lag–Lead Compensation. Lead compensation essentially yields an appreciable improvement in transient response and a small change in steady-state accuracy.It may accentuate high-frequency noise effects.Lag compensation, on the other hand, yields an appreciable improvement in steady-state accuracy at the expense of increasing the transient-response time. Lag compensation will suppress the effects of high-frequency noise signals. Lag–lead compensation combines the characteristics of both lead compensation and lag compensation.The use of a lead or lag compensator raises the order of the system by 1 (unless cancellation occurs between the zero of the compensator and a pole of the uncompensated open-loop transfer function).The use of a lag–lead compensator raises the order of the system by 2 [unless cancellation occurs between zero(s) of the lag–lead compensator and pole(s) of the uncompensated open-loop transfer function], which means that the system becomes more complex and it is more difficult to control the transient-response behavior.The particular situation determines the type of compensation to be used.  \n\n# 7–11 LEAD COMPENSATION  \n\nWe shall first examine the frequency characteristics of the lead compensator. Then we present a design technique for the lead compensator by use of the Bode diagram.  \n\nCharacteristics of Lead Compensators. Consider a lead compensator having the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\alpha\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}=K_{c}\\,{\\frac{s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T}}}{s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}}\\qquad(0<\\alpha<1)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the attenuation factor of the lead compensator. It has a zero at $s=-1/T$ and a pole at $s=-1/(\\alpha T)$ .Since $0<\\alpha<1$ ,we see that the zero is always located to the right of the pole in the complex plane. Note that for a small value of $\\alpha$ the pole is located far to the left. The minimum value of $\\alpha$ is limited by the physical construction of the lead compensator.The minimum value of $\\alpha$ is usually taken to be about 0.05. (This means that the maximum phase lead that may be produced by a lead compensator is about $65^{\\circ}$ .) [See Equation (7–25).]  \n\nThe image presents a detailed diagram illustrating various mathematical concepts, including complex numbers and their polar form. The diagram features a semicircle with points labeled at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°, as well as a unit circle centered at the origin.\n\n*   **Unit Circle**\n    *   A circle with a radius of 1 unit, centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n    *   It is represented by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1, where x and y are the coordinates on the real and imaginary axes, respectively.\n*   **Polar Form**\n    *   A way to represent complex numbers using their magnitude (length from the origin) and angle in standard position.\n    *   The polar form of a complex number z is given by r(cosθ + isinθ), where:\n        *   r is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number, representing its length from the origin.\n        *   θ (theta) is the argument or angle of the complex number in standard position.\n*   **Trigonometric Functions**\n    *   Representations of circular motion as a function of time and are used to describe oscillatory phenomena in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other fields.\n    *   Common trigonometric functions include:\n        *   Sine (sin)\n        *   Cosine (cos)\n        *   Tangent (tan)\n*   **Argument and Angle**\n    *   In the context of complex numbers, the argument refers to the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to the point representing the complex number in the complex plane.\n    *   The angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis and can be represented by θ (theta).\n*   **Complex Plane**\n    *   A geometric representation of complex numbers, where each point corresponds to a unique complex number.\n    *   The complex plane consists of two perpendicular axes: the real axis (horizontal) and the imaginary axis (vertical).\n\nIn summary, the diagram effectively illustrates the relationships between complex numbers, their polar form, and trigonometric functions. It provides a visual representation of how these concepts are interconnected and how they can be used to describe various mathematical phenomena. 7–91 Polar plot of a lead compensator $\\alpha(j\\omega T\\,+\\,1)/(j\\omega\\alpha T\\,+\\,1),$ ,where $0<\\alpha<1$ .  \n\nFigure 7–91 shows the polar plot of  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\alpha\\frac{j\\omega T\\,+\\,1}{j\\omega\\alpha T\\,+\\,1}\\qquad(0<\\alpha<1)\n$$  \n\nwith $K_{c}=1.$ .For a given value of $\\alpha$ , the angle between the positive real axis and the tangent line drawn from the origin to the semicircle gives the maximum phase-lead angle, $\\phi_{m}$ .We shall call the frequency at the tangent point $\\omega_{m}$ .From Figure 7–91 the phase angle at $\\omega\\,=\\,\\omega_{m}$ is $\\phi_{m}$ ,where  \n\n$$\n\\sin\\phi_{m}=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\displaystyle\\frac{1-\\alpha}{2}}{\\displaystyle\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}\n$$  \n\nEquation (7–25) relates the maximum phase-lead angle and the value of $\\alpha$ .  \n\nFigure 7–92 shows the Bode diagram of a lead compensator when $K_{c}=1$ and $\\alpha=0.1$ .The corner frequencies for the lead compensator are $\\omega=1/T$ and $\\omega=1/(\\alpha T)=10/T$ .By examining Figure 7–92, we see that $\\omega_{m}$ is the geometric mean of the two corner frequencies, or  \n\n$$\n\\log\\omega_{m}={\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\log{\\frac{1}{T}}+\\log{\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–92   \nBode diagram of a   \nlead compensator   \n$\\alpha(j\\omega T\\,+\\,1)/(j\\omega\\alpha T\\,+\\,1)$ ,where $\\alpha=0.1$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a graph with two plots, each displaying a line that oscillates between positive and negative values. The x-axis is labeled \"1/T\" and ranges from 0 to approximately 20, while the y-axis has no label but appears to represent a unitless quantity.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Line Behavior:** The lines exhibit periodic behavior, with each peak corresponding to an increase in value followed by a decrease.\n*   **Oscillation Pattern:** The oscillations are symmetrical about the x-axis, indicating that the magnitude of the values remains consistent regardless of whether they are positive or negative.\n*   **Frequency of Oscillations:** As the input (1/T) increases, the frequency of the oscillations also increases. This is evident from the increasing density of peaks and troughs as one moves to the right on the x-axis.\n*   **Phase Shift:** The lines exhibit a phase shift as they transition from positive to negative values. This phase shift occurs at regular intervals, suggesting a periodic nature to the underlying function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph appears to represent a mathematical function that exhibits oscillatory behavior with increasing frequency as the input increases. The symmetrical oscillations and phase shifts suggest a sinusoidal or trigonometric function as the underlying model. Further analysis would be required to determine the specific function represented by this graph.  \nvin rad/sec  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{m}={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}T}}\n$$  \n\nAs seen from Figure 7–92, the lead compensator is basically a high-pass filter. (The high frequencies are passed, but low frequencies are attenuated.)  \n\nLead Compensation Techniques Based on the Frequency-Response Approach. The primary function of the lead compensator is to reshape the frequency-response curve to provide sufficient phase-lead angle to offset the excessive phase lag associated with the components of the fixed system.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 7–93.Assume that the performance specifications are given in terms of phase margin, gain margin, static velocity error constants, and so on.The procedure for designing a lead compensator by the frequency-response approach may be stated as follows:  \n\n1. Assume the following lead compensator:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\alpha\\frac{T s+1}{\\alpha T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}\\qquad(0<\\alpha<1)\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\alpha\\,=\\,K\n$$  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K\\,\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,K\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,G(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,K G(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,G_{1}(s)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)\\,=\\,K G(s)\n$$  \n\nDetermine gain $K$ to satisfy the requirement on the given static error constant.  \n\n2. Using the gain $K$ thus determined, draw a Bode diagram of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ ,the gainadjusted but uncompensated system. Evaluate the phase margin. 3. Determine the necessary phase-lead angle to be added to the system. Add an additional $5^{\\circ}$ to $12^{\\circ}$ to the phase-lead angle required, because the addition of the lead compensator shifts the gain crossover frequency to the right and decreases the phase margin.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a signal processing system, consisting of two blocks connected by an arrow. The first block is labeled \"G_c(s)\" and has an input and output port. The second block is labeled \"G(s)\" and also has an input and output port.\n\n*   **Block G_c(s)**\n    *   This block represents a transfer function or system that takes the input signal and processes it.\n    *   It has one input port, which receives the input signal.\n    *   The processed signal is then passed to the next block through its output port.\n*   **Arrow connecting the blocks**\n    *   The arrow indicates the flow of signals from one block to another.\n    *   It shows that the output of the first block serves as the input for the second block.\n*   **Block G(s)**\n    *   This block represents another transfer function or system that processes the signal received from the previous block.\n    *   It has one input port, which receives the processed signal from the first block.\n    *   The final processed signal is then output from this block through its output port.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a sequential processing of signals through two blocks, each representing different stages of signal transformation. 7–93 Control system.  \n\n4. Determine the attenuation factor 1 by use of Equation (7–25). Determine the $-2\\dot{0}\\log\\left(\\dot{1}/\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\right)$ frequency where the magnitude of the uncompensated system .Select this frequency as the new gain crossover frequency. This A B$G_{1}(j\\omega)$ is equal to frequency corresponds to $\\omega_{m}=\\mathbf{\\hat{1}}/(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T),$ ,and the maximum phase shift $\\phi_{m}$ occurs at this frequency.  \n\n5. Determine the corner frequencies of the lead compensator as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\mathrm{Zero~of~lead~compensator}}{\\mathrm{:~}}\\quad\\omega={\\frac{1}{T}}}\\\\ {{\\mathrm{Pole~of~lead~compensator}}{\\mathrm{:~}}\\quad\\ \\omega={\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n6. Using the value of $K$ determined in step 1 and that of $\\alpha$ determined in step 4, calculate constant $K_{c}$ from  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\frac{K}{\\alpha}\n$$  \n\n7. Check the gain margin to be sure it is satisfactory. If not, repeat the design process by modifying the pole–zero location of the compensator until a satisfactory result is obtained.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–26  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 7–94.The open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{4}{s(s+2)}}\n$$  \n\nIt is desired to design a compensator for the system so that the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is $20\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ ,the phase margin is at least $50^{\\circ}$ , and the gain margin is at least $10\\:\\mathrm{dB}$ .We shall use a lead compensator of the form  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\alpha\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}=K_{c}{\\frac{s+{\\frac{1}{T}}}{s+{\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}}\n$$  \n\nThe compensated system will have the open-loop transfer function $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ .Define  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)\\,=\\,K G(s)\\,=\\frac{4K}{s(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K=K_{c}\\alpha$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a mathematical equation, specifically an algebraic expression, presented in a diagrammatic form. The equation is written in black font and comprises two components:\n\n*   **Input Term**: The first part of the equation represents an input term, which is a constant value (4) multiplied by a variable (s). This is indicated by the symbol (+) on the left side of the equation.\n*   **Output Term**: The second part of the equation represents an output term, which is the result of dividing the input term by a constant value (2).\n\n**Visual Representation**\n\nThe diagrammatic representation of the equation features three distinct elements:\n\n*   **Constant Value 4**: Positioned at the top left corner of the rectangle.\n*   **Variable s**: Located directly below the constant value 4, within the same rectangle.\n*   **Constant Value 2**: Placed on the right side of the rectangle.\n\n**Symbolism**\n\nThe equation employs a combination of symbols to convey its meaning:\n\n*   The plus sign (+) preceding the first term indicates addition.\n*   The forward slash (/) separating the input and output terms represents division.\n*   The equals sign (=) is absent from the equation, suggesting that it represents an expression rather than an equality.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a mathematical equation comprising an input term and an output term connected by a division operation. The use of symbols effectively communicates the structure and relationships between the different components of the equation. 7–94 Control system.  \n\nThe first step in the design is to adjust the gain $K$ to meet the steady-state performance specification or to provide the required static velocity error constant. Since this constant is given as $20\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , we obtain  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}s\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,G_{1}(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\to0}{\\frac{s4K}{s(s\\,+\\,2)}}\\,=\\,2K\\,=\\,20\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK=10\n$$  \n\nWith $K=10$ , the compensated system will satisfy the steady-state requirement. We shall next plot the Bode diagram of  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{40}{j\\omega(j\\omega\\,+\\,2)}=\\frac{20}{j\\omega(0.5j\\omega\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–95 shows the magnitude and phase-angle curves of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ . From this plot, the phase and gain margins of the system are found to be $17^{\\circ}$ and $+\\infty$ dB, respectively. (A phase margin of $17^{\\circ}$ implies that the system is quite oscillatory.Thus, satisfying the specification on the steady state yields a poor transient-response performance.) The specification calls for a phase margin of at least $50^{\\circ}$ . We thus find the additional phase lead necessary to satisfy the relative stability requirement is $33^{\\circ}$ .To achieve a phase margin of $50^{\\circ}$ without decreasing the value of $K$ ,the lead compensator must contribute the required phase angle.  \n\nNoting that the addition of a lead compensator modifies the magnitude curve in the Bode diagram, we realize that the gain crossover frequency will be shifted to the right.We must offset the increased phase lag of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ due to this increase in the gain crossover frequency. Considering the shift of the gain crossover frequency, we may assume that $\\phi_{m}$ ,the maximum phase lead required, is approximately $38^{\\circ}$ . (This means that $5^{\\circ}$ has been added to compensate for the shift in the gain crossover frequency.)  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\sin\\phi_{m}=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a unique curve. The top section displays a semicircular shape, while the bottom section shows a straight line.\n\n**Top Section: Semicircular Curve**\n\n*   **Shape:** The curve is semi-circular, resembling a half-circle.\n*   **Position:** It is positioned in the upper right quadrant of the graph.\n*   **Axis Alignment:** The x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical) are aligned with the center point of the semicircle.\n*   **Labeling:** No specific labels or units are provided for this section.\n\n**Bottom Section: Straight Line**\n\n*   **Shape:** A straight line runs diagonally from top left to bottom right.\n*   **Position:** It occupies the lower left quadrant of the graph.\n*   **Axis Alignment:** The x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical) intersect at a 45-degree angle, forming a diagonal line.\n*   **Labeling:** No specific labels or units are provided for this section.\n\n**Common Features**\n\n*   **Axes:** Both sections share the same axes, with no visible labels or units.\n*   **Gridlines:** A grid pattern is present in both sections, but it appears to be incomplete.\n*   **Data Points:** There are no visible data points plotted on either curve.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two distinct graphical elements: a semicircular curve and a straight line. While there are no specific labels or units provided, the curves suggest some form of mathematical relationship or function being represented. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the exact nature or purpose of these graphs. 7–95 Bode diagram for $G_{1}(j\\omega)\\,=\\,10G(j\\omega)$ $=40/{\\left[j\\omega(j\\omega+2)\\right]}$   \nvin rad/sec  \n\n$\\phi_{m}=38^{\\circ}$ corresponds to $\\alpha=0.24$ .Once the attenuation factor $\\alpha$ has been determined on the 1 1 basis of the required phase-lead angle,the next step is to determine the corner frequencies and angle $\\omega=1/(\\alpha T)$ $\\phi_{m}$ occurs at the geometric mean of the two corner frequencies,or of the lead compensator. To do so, we first note that the maximum phase-lead $\\omega=1/(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T)$ A A B.B[See Equa$\\omega=1/T$ tion (7–26).] The amount of the modification in the magnitude curve at $\\omega\\,=\\,1/(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T)$ due to the inclusion of the term $(T s\\,+\\,1)/(\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\left|{\\frac{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega\\alpha T}}\\right|_{\\omega=1/({\\sqrt\\alpha}T)}=\\left|{\\frac{1+j{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt\\alpha}}}{1\\,+\\,j\\alpha{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt\\alpha}}}}\\right|={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt\\alpha}}\n$$  \n\nNote that  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}}={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.24}}}={\\frac{1}{0.49}}=6.2\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\ngain crossover frequency $\\left|G_{1}(j\\omega)\\right|\\,=-6.2\\,\\mathrm{dE}$ A 1 Bcorre $\\omega_{c}$ onds to . Noting that this frequency corresponds to $\\omega=9$ 1 rad 'sec.We shall select this frequency $1/(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T)$ A Bnew ,or $\\bar{\\omega}_{c}=1/\\big(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T\\big)$ ,we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T}=\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\omega_{c}=4.41\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}=\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}=18.4\\\n$$  \n\nThe lead compensator thus determined is  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,4.41}{s\\,+\\,18.4}=\\,K_{c}\\alpha\\,\\frac{0.227s\\,+\\,1}{0.054s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nwhere the value of $K_{c}$ is determined as  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\frac{K}{\\alpha}=\\frac{10}{0.24}=41.7\n$$  \n\nThus, the transfer function of the compensator becomes  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,41.7\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,4.41}{s\\,+\\,18.4}=\\,10\\,\\frac{0.227s\\,+\\,1}{0.054s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nNote that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{G_{c}(s)}{K}\\,G_{1}(s)\\,=\\frac{G_{c}(s)}{10}\\,10G(s)\\,=\\,G_{c}(s)G(s)\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude curve and phase-angle curve for $G_{c}(j\\omega)/10$ are shown in Figure 7–96. The compensated system has the following open-loop transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,41.7\\,\\frac{s\\,+\\,4.41}{s\\,+\\,18.4}\\frac{4}{s(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents two graphs, each featuring a distinct set of lines and symbols. The top graph is labeled \"dB\" on its y-axis and has an x-axis that ranges from 1 to 40. It contains multiple lines with various labels such as Gc/10, Kv, and GcG. Notably, the line corresponding to Gc/10 exhibits a peak at around 2 on the x-axis.\n\nThe bottom graph also features an x-axis spanning from -180° to 100°, but its y-axis lacks a label. This graph includes lines with labels like G1 = 10G and Gc/10, accompanied by symbols such as G1 and Kv. The line representing G1 = 10G displays a peak at approximately -90° on the x-axis.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that both graphs are superimposed over one another. This suggests that they share common characteristics or relationships between their respective variables. 7–96 Bode diagram for the compensated system.   \nvin rad/sec  \n\nThe solid curves in Figure 7–96 show the magnitude curve and phase-angle curve for the compensated system.Note that the bandwidth is approximately equal to the gain crossover frequency. The lead compensator causes the gain crossover frequency to increase from 6.3 to 9 rad 'sec. The increase in this frequency means an increase in bandwidth.This implies an increase in the speed of response.The phase and gain margins are seen to be approximately $50^{\\circ}$ and $+\\infty$ dB, respectively. The compensated system shown in Figure 7–97 therefore meets both the steady-state and the relative-stability requirements.  \n\nNote that for type 1 systems, such as the system just considered, the value of the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is merely the value of the frequency corresponding to the intersection of the extension of the initial $-20{\\mathrm{-dB}}$ 'decade slope line and the 0-dB line, as shown in Figure 7–96. Note also that we have changed the slope of the magnitude curve near the gain crossover frequency from $-40$ dB 'decade to $-20$ dB 'decade.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation, specifically an expression for solving a differential equation. The equation is written in a box with two lines extending from it to the left and right sides of the image.\n\n*   **Left Side:**\n    *   A line extends from the left side of the box to the top-left corner of the image.\n    *   In this area, there is an arrow pointing towards the right, indicating that the value on the left side of the equation should be moved to the right.\n*   **Right Side:**\n    *   Another line extends from the right side of the box to the bottom-right corner of the image.\n    *   This line has no additional text or symbols.\n\nThe overall structure of the image suggests that it is a mathematical expression used in solving differential equations, where the value on one side of the equation is related to the value on the other side through some operation indicated by the lines and arrows. 7–97 Compensated system.  \n\nFigure 7–98 shows the polar plots of the gain-adjusted but uncompensated open-loop transfer function $G_{1}(j\\omega)\\,=\\,10\\,G(j\\omega)$ and the compensated open-loop transfer function $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ .From Figure 7–98, we see that the resonant frequency of the uncompensated system is about 6 rad 'sec and that of the compensated system is about 7 rad 'sec. (This also indicates that the bandwidth has been increased.)  \n\nFrom Figure 7–98, we find that the value of the resonant peak $M_{r}$ for the uncompensated system with $K=10$ is 3.The value of $M_{r}$ for the compensated system is found to be 1.29.This clearly shows that the compensated system has improved relative stability.  \n\nNote that, if the phase angle of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ decreases rapidly near the gain crossover frequency, lead compensation becomes ineffective because the shift in the gain crossover frequency to the right makes it difficult to provide enough phase lead at the new gain crossover frequency. This means that, to provide the desired phase margin, we must use a very small value for $\\alpha$ .The value of $\\alpha$ , however, should not be too small (smaller than 0.05) nor should the maximum phase lead $\\phi_{m}$ be too large (larger than $65^{\\circ}$ ), because such values will require an additional gain of excessive value. [If more than $65^{\\circ}$ is needed, two (or more) lead networks may be used in series with an isolating amplifier.]  \n\nFinally, we shall examine the transient-response characteristics of the designed system. We shall obtain the unit-step response and unit-ramp response curves of the compensated and uncompensated systems with MATLAB. Note that the closed-loop transfer functions of the uncompensated and compensated systems are given, respectively, by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{4}{s^{2}+2s+4}}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{166.8s\\,+\\,735.588}{s^{3}\\,+\\,20.4s^{2}\\,+\\,203.6s\\,+\\,735.588}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a black and white graph featuring a large circle, smaller circles, and several lines. The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" on the right side of the graph and runs from -4 to 1. The y-axis is labeled \"Im\" at the top of the graph and runs from -4 to 1.\n\nThe large circle dominates the center of the graph, with its left side extending into the negative quadrant of the coordinate system. It is labeled \"M = -j1.29\", indicating that it represents a complex number M with a real part of -1.29 and an imaginary part of 0. The smaller circles are positioned near the bottom of the graph, each associated with lines that extend upwards from them.\n\nThese lines represent the functions G1(jω), Gc(jω)G(jω). Each line is marked with its corresponding equation:\n\n*   G1(jω): ω = -3\n*   Gc(jω)G(jω): ω = 4\n\nThe labels on these equations suggest that they are mathematical representations of the functions being graphed. The graphs themselves appear to be plots of the imaginary parts of these functions against their real parts.\n\nOverall, the image presents a clear and concise visual representation of complex numbers and their relationships, making it easy to understand and analyze the data presented. 7–98 Polar plots of the gain-adjusted but uncompensated open-loop transfer function $G_{1}$ and compensated openloop transfer function $G_{c}G$ .  \n\nMATLAB programs for obtaining the unit-step response and unit-ramp response curves are given in MATLAB Program 7–13. Figure 7–99 shows the unit-step response curves of the system before and after compensation. Also, Figure 7–100 depicts the unit-ramp response curves before and after compensation.These response curves indicate that the designed system is satisfactory.  \n\nThe image displays a MATLAB program for generating unit-step, unit-ramp, and unit-ramp responses of compensated and uncompensated systems. The program is written in a clear and concise manner, with each section labeled and explained.\n\n*   **Unit-Step Responses**\n    *   The first section of the program calculates the unit-step response of a compensated system.\n        *   It uses the `step()` function to generate the response.\n        *   The output is plotted using the `plot()` function.\n    *   The second section calculates the unit-step response of an uncompensated system.\n        *   It also uses the `step()` function to generate the response.\n        *   The output is plotted using the `plot()` function.\n*   **Unit-Ramp Responses**\n    *   The third section calculates the unit-ramp response of a compensated system.\n        *   It uses the `step()` function with an input of `1/t` to generate the response.\n        *   The output is plotted using the `plot()` function.\n    *   The fourth section calculates the unit-ramp response of an uncompensated system.\n        *   It also uses the `step()` function with an input of `1/t` to generate the response.\n        *   The output is plotted using the `plot()` function.\n\nOverall, the program provides a clear and concise way to visualize the responses of compensated and uncompensated systems.  \n\nIt is noted that the closed-loop poles for the compensated system are located as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{s\\,=\\,-6.9541\\,\\pm\\,j8.0592}}\\\\ {{}}\\\\ {{s\\,=\\,-6.4918}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBecause the dominant closed-loop poles are located far from the $j\\omega$ axis, the response damps out quickly.  \n\nThe image presents a graph comparing the step responses of two systems: a compensated system and an uncompensated system. The graph is titled \"Unit-Step Responses of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems.\" \n\n*   **Title**\n    *   Unit-Step Responses of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems\n*   **Graph Description**\n    *   The graph displays the outputs of both systems over time, with the x-axis representing time in seconds (t Sec) and the y-axis representing output values.\n    *   The compensated system's response is depicted by a black line labeled \"Compensated System,\" while the uncompensated system's response is represented by a dotted gray line labeled \"Uncompensated System.\"\n    *   Both lines start at 0 seconds and increase as time progresses, with the compensated system reaching its maximum output value first.\n    *   The graph also includes labels for the x-axis (t Sec) and y-axis (Outputs), as well as numerical values indicating the output values of both systems at specific times (e.g., 1 second).\n*   **Statistics**\n    *   The compensated system's response reaches its maximum output value around 0.5 seconds, while the uncompensated system takes longer to reach its peak.\n    *   By 2 seconds, the uncompensated system has surpassed the compensated system in terms of output value.\n    *   At 6 seconds, both systems have returned to their initial state, with no significant difference between them.\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates the step responses of a compensated and an uncompensated system, highlighting differences in their performance over time. The compensated system exhibits faster response times but eventually catches up with the uncompensated system as output values increase. 7–99 Unit-step response curves of the compensated and uncompensated systems.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the unit-ramp responses of compensated and uncompensated systems. The graph features two lines, one for each system type, with the x-axis labeled \"t Sec\" (time in seconds) and the y-axis labeled \"Outputs.\" The title at the top of the graph reads \"Unit-Ramp Responses of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems.\"\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Graph Title:** Unit-Ramp Responses of Compensated and Uncompensated Systems\n*   **X-Axis Label:** t Sec (time in seconds)\n*   **Y-Axis Label:** Outputs\n*   **Lines:**\n    *   One line represents the uncompensated system.\n    *   Another line represents the compensated system.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe graph displays the output of each system over time, with the uncompensated system exhibiting a steeper slope than the compensated system. This suggests that the uncompensated system responds more quickly to changes in input, but may also be more prone to oscillations or instability. In contrast, the compensated system responds more gradually, but is likely to be more stable and less susceptible to oscillations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, the graph provides a clear visual representation of the differences between compensated and uncompensated systems in terms of their unit-ramp responses. By analyzing these differences, engineers can better understand how to design and optimize systems for specific applications. 7–100 Unit-ramp response curves of the compensated and uncompensated systems.  \n\n# 7–12 LAG COMPENSATION  \n\nIn this section we first discuss the Nyquist plot and Bode diagram of the lag compensator.   \nThen we present lag compensation techniques based on the frequency-response approach.  \n\nCharacteristics of Lag Compensators. Consider a lag compensator having the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\beta\\frac{T s+1}{\\beta T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\\qquad(\\beta>1)\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"Re\" and \"Im\", which are typically used to represent real and imaginary parts of complex numbers. The graph features several curves and lines that intersect at various points.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Curves:**\n    *   Two semicircles, one centered at $(0,-1)$ with a radius of 1 and the other centered at $(2,0)$ with a radius of 3.\n    *   A line segment connecting the points $(0,-1)$ and $(2,0)$.\n*   **Intersections:**\n    *   The two semicircles intersect at three distinct points: $(1.5,-0.866)$, $(1.5,-0.866)$, and $(2,0)$.\n    *   The line segment intersects the rightmost semicircle at the point $(2,0)$.\n\n**Additional Observations:**\n\n*   The graph appears to be a representation of complex numbers in the form $a + bi$, where $a$ is the real part and $b$ is the imaginary part.\n*   The use of semicircles suggests that the graph may be related to the concept of half-planes or regions in the complex plane.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image depicts a graph with multiple intersecting curves, including two semicircles and a line segment. The intersections occur at specific points, which could represent critical values or boundaries within the complex plane. While the exact meaning of this graph is not explicitly stated, it likely relates to properties of complex numbers or geometric transformations in the complex plane. 7–101 Polar plot of a lag compensator $K_{c}\\beta\\bar{(j\\omega{\\cal T}\\,+\\,1)}/(j\\omega\\beta{\\cal T}\\,+\\,1).$  \n\nFigure 7–102   \nBode diagram of a   \nlag compensator   \n$\\beta(j\\omega T\\,+\\,1)/(j\\omega\\beta T\\,+\\,1).$ ,with $\\beta=10$ .  \n\nThe image presents a Bode plot, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The plot consists of two graphs: one for magnitude (gain) and another for phase angle.\n\n**Graph 1: Magnitude Plot**\n\n*   **X-axis:** Logarithmic scale representing the frequency in radians per second (rad/s).\n*   **Y-axis:** Decibel (dB) scale representing the magnitude or gain of the system.\n*   **Plot:** A straight line with a slope of -20 dB/decade, indicating a roll-off of 20 dB for each decade increase in frequency.\n\n**Graph 2: Phase Angle Plot**\n\n*   **X-axis:** Logarithmic scale representing the frequency in radians per second (rad/s).\n*   **Y-axis:** Degrees (°) scale representing the phase angle.\n*   **Plot:** A curved line with a phase shift of approximately -90° at low frequencies and 0° at high frequencies, indicating a phase lead.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The magnitude plot shows a constant gain of 0 dB at low frequencies, followed by a roll-off of 20 dB/decade.\n*   The phase angle plot exhibits a phase shift of approximately -90° at low frequencies and 0° at high frequencies.\n*   The intersection point between the two graphs is at a frequency corresponding to a phase angle of -45°.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Bode plot provides a visual representation of the frequency response characteristics of a system, including its magnitude (gain) and phase angle. The straight line in the magnitude plot indicates a first-order system with a single pole, while the curved line in the phase angle plot suggests a second-order system with two poles.  \nvin rad/sec  \n\nIn the complex plane, a lag compensator has a zero at $s=-1/T$ and a pole at $s=-1/(\\beta T)$ .The pole is located to the right of the zero.  \n\nFigure 7–101 shows a polar plot of the lag compensator. Figure 7–102 shows a Bode diagram of the compensator, where $K_{c}=1$ and $\\beta=10$ .The corner frequencies of the lag compensator are at $\\omega=1/T$ and $\\omega\\,=\\,1/(\\beta T)$ .As seen from Figure 7–102, where the values of $K_{c}$ and $\\beta$ are set equal to 1 and 10, respectively, the magnitude of the lag compensator becomes 10 (or 20 dB) at low frequencies and unity (or 0 dB) at high frequencies.Thus, the lag compensator is essentially a low-pass filter.  \n\nLag Compensation Techniques Based on the Frequency-Response Approach. The primary function of a lag compensator is to provide attenuation in the highfrequency range to give a system sufficient phase margin. The phase-lag characteristic is of no consequence in lag compensation.  \n\nThe procedure for designing lag compensators for the system shown in Figure 7–93 by the frequency-response approach may be stated as follows:  \n\n1. Assume the following lag compensator:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\beta\\frac{T s+1}{\\beta T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\\qquad(\\beta>1)\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\beta\\,=\\,K\n$$  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K\\,\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\beta T s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,K\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\beta T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,G(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\beta T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,K G(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\beta T s\\,+\\,1}}\\,G_{1}(s)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)\\,=\\,K G(s)\n$$  \n\nDetermine gain $K$ to satisfy the requirement on the given static velocity error constant.  \n\n2. If the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system $G_{1}(j\\omega)\\,=\\,K G(j\\omega)$ does not satisfy the specifications on the phase and gain margins, then find the frequency point where the phase angle of the open-loop transfer function is equal to $-180^{\\circ}$ plus the required phase margin. The required phase margin is the specified phase margin plus $5^{\\circ}$ to $12^{\\circ}$ . (The addition of $5^{\\circ}$ to $12^{\\circ}$ compensates for the phase lag of the lag compensator.) Choose this frequency as the new gain crossover frequency.  \n\n3. To prevent detrimental effects of phase lag due to the lag compensator, the pole and zero of the lag compensator must be located substantially lower than the new gain crossover frequency. Therefore, choose the corner frequency $\\omega=1/T$ (corresponding to the zero of the lag compensator) 1 octave to 1 decade below the new gain crossover frequency. (If the time constants of the lag compensator do not become too large, the corner frequency $\\omega=1/T$ may be chosen 1 decade below the new gain crossover frequency.)  \n\nNotice that we choose the compensator pole and zero sufficiently small.Thus the phase lag occurs at the low-frequency region so that it will not affect the phase margin.  \n\n4. Determine the attenuation necessary to bring the magnitude curve down to 0 dB at the new gain crossover frequency. Noting that this attenuation is $-20\\log\\beta$ ,determine the value of $\\beta$ . Then the other corner frequency (corresponding to the pole of the lag compensator) is determined from $\\omega\\,=\\,1/(\\beta T)$ .  \n\n5. Using the value of $K$ determined in step 1 and that of $\\beta$ determined in step 4, calculate constant $K_{c}$ from  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\frac{K}{\\beta}\n$$  \n\nEXAMPLE 7–27 Consider the system shown in Figure 7–103.The open-loop transfer function is given by  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{1}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(0.5s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nIt is desired to compensate the system so that the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is $5\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , the phase margin is at least $40^{\\circ}$ , and the gain margin is at least 10 dB.  \n\nWe shall use a lag compensator of the form  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\beta\\frac{T s+1}{\\beta T s+1}=K_{c}\\frac{s+\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}\\qquad(\\beta>1)\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\nK_{c}\\beta=K\n$$  \n\nDefine also  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)\\,=\\,K G(s)\\,=\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(0.5s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThe first step in the design is to adjust the gain $K$ to meet the required static velocity error constant.Thus,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K_{v}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s\\,\\displaystyle\\frac{T s\\,+1}{\\beta T s\\,+1}G_{1}(s)\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{1}(s)\\,}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\displaystyle\\frac{s K}{s(s\\,+1)(0.5s\\,+\\,1)}=K\\,=\\,5}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK=5\n$$  \n\nWith $K=5$ ,the compensated system satisfies the steady-state performance requirement. We shall next plot the Bode diagram of  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(j\\omega)=\\frac{5}{j\\omega(j\\omega+1)(0.5j\\omega+1)}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a signal processing system, featuring a single input and output. The input is represented by an arrow pointing to the left, while the output is denoted by an arrow pointing to the right.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Input:** A source from which signals are fed into the system.\n*   **Block 1:** A rectangular block containing mathematical operations or transformations applied to the input signal. In this case, it represents a function that takes the input signal and performs some operation on it.\n*   **Arrow:** A line connecting Block 1 to the output, indicating the flow of processed signals from one component to another.\n\n**Mathematical Operations:**\n\nThe equation within Block 1 is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{s(s+1)(0.5s+1)} \\]\n\nThis represents a transfer function or system model, which describes how the input signal is transformed by the system and produced as an output signal. The denominator of the fraction indicates that the system has three poles in its characteristic equation.\n\n**Overall Structure:**\n\nThe block diagram illustrates the basic structure of a signal processing system with a single input, a block representing mathematical operations or transformations, and a single output. 7–103 Control system.  \n\nThe image presents two graphs, each displaying a frequency response plot. The top graph is labeled \"dB\" on the y-axis and \"ω in rad/sec\" on the x-axis, while the bottom graph has no labels.\n\n**Top Graph:**\n\n*   The top graph features four lines with distinct labels:\n    *   G1\n    *   GC\n    *   GG\n    *   GK\n*   Each line represents a different gain function.\n*   The lines are plotted against the frequency response, with the y-axis representing decibels (dB) and the x-axis representing angular frequency in radians per second.\n\n**Bottom Graph:**\n\n*   The bottom graph appears to be a Bode plot or a similar type of frequency response analysis.\n*   It lacks labels on both axes but seems to follow the same format as the top graph.\n*   Several lines are visible, but their specific functions and labels are unclear due to the lack of information.\n\n**Additional Features:**\n\n*   Both graphs have dotted lines connecting certain points or regions, suggesting additional relationships between the data.\n*   There is no clear indication of what these connections represent without further context.\n*   The background of both graphs is white with a grid pattern, facilitating easy reading and interpretation of the data.\n\nIn summary, the image displays two frequency response plots, each with its own set of lines representing different gain functions. While the top graph provides labels for clarity, the bottom graph lacks clear labeling but shares similarities in structure. The dotted lines suggest additional connections or relationships between the data points, but their meaning remains unclear without more context. 7–104 Bode diagrams for $G_{1}$ (gain-adjusted but uncompensated open-loop transfer function), $G_{c}$ (compensator), and $G_{c}G$ (compensated open-loop transfer function).  \n\nThe magnitude curve and phase-angle curve of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ are shown in Figure 7–104. From this plot, the phase margin is found to be $-20^{\\circ}$ , which means that the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is unstable.  \n\nNoting that the addition of a lag compensator modifies the phase curve of the Bode diagram, we must allow $5^{\\circ}$ to $12^{\\circ}$ to the specified phase margin to compensate for the modification of the phase curve.Since the frequency corresponding to a phase margin of $40^{\\circ}$ is 0.7 rad 'sec,the new gain crossover frequency (of the compensated system) must be chosen near this value. To avoid overly large time constants for the lag compensator,we shall choose the corner frequency $\\omega=1/T$ (which corresponds to the zero of the lag compensator) to be 0.1 rad 'sec.Since this corner frequency is not too far below the new gain crossover frequency,the modification in the phase curve may not be small.Hence,we add about $12^{\\circ}$ to the given phase margin as an allowance to account for the lag angle introduced by the lag compensator.The required phase margin is now $52^{\\circ}$ .The phase angle of the uncompensated open-loop transfer function is $-128^{\\circ}$ at about $\\omega=0.5$ rad 'sec. So we choose the new gain crossover frequency to be 0.5 rad 'sec.To bring the magnitude curve down to $0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at this new gain crossover frequency,the lag compensator must give the necessary attenuation, which in this case is $-20$ dB. Hence,  \n\n$$\n20\\log{\\frac{1}{\\beta}}=-20\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\beta=10\n$$  \n\nThe other corner frequency $\\omega\\,=\\,1(\\beta T)$ , which corresponds to the pole of the lag compensator, is then determined as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{\\beta T}}=0.01\\;\\mathrm{rad/sec}\n$$  \n\nThus, the transfer function of the lag compensator is  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}(10)\\,\\frac{10s\\,+\\,1}{100s\\,+\\,1}=K_{c}\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{10}}{s\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{100}}\n$$  \n\nSince the gain $K$ was determined to be 5 and $\\beta$ was determined to be 10, we have  \n\n$$\nK_{c}=\\frac{K}{\\beta}=\\frac{5}{10}=0.5\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\frac{5(10s\\,+\\,1)}{s(100s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,1)(0.5s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude and phase-angle curves of $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ are also shown in Figure 7–104.  \n\nThe phase margin of the compensated system is about $40^{\\circ}$ , which is the required value. The gain margin is about 11 dB, which is quite acceptable.The static velocity error constant is $5\\,\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ ,as required. The compensated system, therefore, satisfies the requirements on both the steady state and the relative stability.  \n\nNote that the new gain crossover frequency is decreased from approximately 1 to 0.5 rad 'sec. This means that the bandwidth of the system is reduced.  \n\nTo further show the effects of lag compensation,the log-magnitude-versus-phase plots of the gainadjusted but uncompensated system $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ and of the compensated system $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ are shown in Figure 7–105.The plot of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ clearly shows that the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is unstable.The addition of the lag compensator stabilizes the system.The plot of $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ is tangent to the $M=3$ dB locus. Thus, the resonant peak value is 3 dB, or 1.4, and this peak occurs at $\\omega=0.5$ rad 'sec.  \n\nCompensators designed by different methods or by different designers (even using the same approach) may look sufficiently different.Any of the well-designed systems, however, will give similar transient and steady-state performance.The best among many alternatives may be chosen from the economic consideration that the time constants of the lag compensator should not be too large.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, labeled \"G1 (in dB)\" on the y-axis and \"G\" on the x-axis. The graph features several curves and points plotted within it.\n\n*   A large circle is drawn in the center of the graph.\n    *   It has a diameter that spans approximately 8 units along both the x- and y-axes.\n    *   The circle does not intersect with any of the plotted lines or points.\n*   Two curves are plotted on the graph, labeled \"G1\" and \"Gc.\"\n    *   Both curves start at the bottom left corner of the graph, where G1 = 0 dB and G = -240°.\n    *   The curves then ascend to the right, with G1 increasing as G decreases.\n    *   The curve for G1 reaches its peak at approximately (4 dB, -180°), while the curve for Gc peaks at around (-2 dB, -150°).\n*   Several points are plotted along each of the two curves.\n    *   The points are represented by small circles and are spaced evenly apart along each curve.\n    *   Each point has a corresponding value listed next to it, indicating its position on the graph.\n*   A grid pattern is overlaid on top of the graph.\n    *   The grid consists of thin black lines that intersect at regular intervals.\n    *   The grid helps to provide additional context and detail for reading the values off the graph.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a complex relationship between G1 and G, with two curves plotted on a grid. The curves peak at different points, and several points are plotted along each curve. The large circle in the center of the graph does not intersect with any of the plotted lines or points. 7–105 Log-magnitudeversus-phase plots of $G_{1}$ (gain-adjusted but uncompensated open-loop transfer function) and $G_{c}G$ (compensated openloop transfer function).   \n1  \n\nFinally, we shall examine the unit-step response and unit-ramp response of the compensated system and the original uncompensated system without gain adjustment. The closed-loop transfer functions of the compensated and uncompensated systems are  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{50s\\:+\\:5}{50s^{4}\\:+\\:150.5s^{3}\\:+\\:101.5s^{2}\\:+\\:51s\\:+\\:5}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{1}{0.5s^{3}\\,+\\,1.5s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nrespectively.

The uncompensated system exhibits a slower response and lower peak value compared to the compensated system. This suggests that the compensation mechanism has improved the system's performance by reducing latency and increasing its overall effectiveness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image presents a clear comparison between an uncompensated system and a compensated system. The data indicates that the compensated system offers superior performance in terms of output response, making it a more effective solution for real-world applications.  \nUnit-Ramp Responses of Compensated  and Uncompensated Systems   \nFigure 7–107 Unit-ramp response curves for the compensated and uncompensated systems (Example 7–27).  \n\nNote that the zero and poles of the designed closed-loop system are as follows:  \n\n$$\n{\\mathrm{sles~at~}}s=-0.2859\\pm\\,j0.5196,\\qquad s=-0.1228,\\qquad s=-2.3155\n$$  \n\nThe dominant closed-loop poles are very close to the $j\\omega$ axis with the result that the response is slow. Also, a pair of the closed-loop pole at $s\\,=\\,-0.1228$ and the zero at $s=-0.1$ produces a slowly decreasing tail of small amplitude.  \n\n# A Few Comments on Lag Compensation.  \n\n1. Lag compensators are essentially low-pass filters. Therefore, lag compensation permits a high gain at low frequencies (which improves the steady-state performance) and reduces gain in the higher critical range of frequencies so as to improve the phase margin. Note that in lag compensation we utilize the attenuation characteristic of the lag compensator at high frequencies rather than the phaselag characteristic. (The phase-lag characteristic is of no use for compensation purposes.)  \n\n2. Suppose that the zero and pole of a lag compensator are located at $s\\,=-z$ and $s=-p$ ,respectively.Then the exact locations of the zero and pole are not critical provided that they are close to the origin and the ratio $z/p$ is equal to the required multiplication factor of the static velocity error constant.  \n\nIt should be noted, however, that the zero and pole of the lag compensator should not be located unnecessarily close to the origin, because the lag compensator will create an additional closed-loop pole in the same region as the zero and pole of the lag compensator.  \n\nThe closed-loop pole located near the origin gives a very slowly decaying transient response, although its magnitude will become very small because the zero of the lag compensator will almost cancel the effect of this pole. However, the transient response (decay) due to this pole is so slow that the settling time will be adversely affected.  \n\nIt is also noted that in the system compensated by a lag compensator the transfer function between the plant disturbance and the system error may not involve a zero that is near this pole. Therefore, the transient response to the disturbance input may last very long.  \n\n3. The attenuation due to the lag compensator will shift the gain crossover frequency to a lower frequency point where the phase margin is acceptable. Thus, the lag compensator will reduce the bandwidth of the system and will result in slower transient response. [The phase angle curve of $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ is relatively unchanged near and above the new gain crossover frequency.]  \n\n4. Since the lag compensator tends to integrate the input signal, it acts approximately as a proportional-plus-integral controller. Because of this, a lag-compensated system tends to become less stable. To avoid this undesirable feature, the time constant $T$ should be made sufficiently larger than the largest time constant of the system.  \n\n5. Conditional stability may occur when a system having saturation or limiting is compensated by use of a lag compensator.When the saturation or limiting takes place in the system, it reduces the effective loop gain.Then the system becomes less stable and unstable operation may even result, as shown in Figure 7–108. To avoid this, the system must be designed so that the effect of lag compensation becomes significant only when the amplitude of the input to the saturating element is small. (This can be done by means of minor feedback-loop compensation.)  \n\nThe image presents a graph illustrating the relationship between decibels (dB) and frequency, with a focus on gain characteristics. The graph is divided into three sections: large gain, small gain, and phi.\n\n**Graph Structure**\n\n*   **Y-axis**: Decibel scale ranging from -180 dB to 40 dB\n*   **X-axis**: Frequency in radians per second (rad/sec) spanning from 0.7 rad/sec to 20 rad/sec\n\n**Gain Characteristics**\n\n*   **Large Gain**: A diagonal line with a positive slope, indicating an increase in gain as frequency increases.\n    *   Starting point: approximately 30 dB at 0.7 rad/sec\n    *   Ending point: approximately 10 dB at 20 rad/sec\n*   **Small Gain**: A curved line with a negative slope, indicating a decrease in gain as frequency increases.\n    *   Starting point: approximately -5 dB at 0.7 rad/sec\n    *   Ending point: approximately -15 dB at 20 rad/sec\n\n**Phi**\n\n*   A vertical line at approximately 2 rad/sec, representing a phase shift of phi degrees.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n*   The large gain section exhibits a positive slope, indicating an increase in gain as frequency increases.\n*   The small gain section shows a negative slope, indicating a decrease in gain as frequency increases.\n*   The phi line intersects both the large and small gain sections at approximately 2 rad/sec.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe graph provides a visual representation of the relationship between decibels and frequency, highlighting the differences in gain characteristics for large and small gains. The intersection of the phi line with both gain sections indicates a phase shift that occurs at a specific frequency. 7–108 Bode diagram of a conditionally stable system.  \n\n# 7–13 LAG–LEAD COMPENSATION  \n\nWe shall first examine the frequency-response characteristics of the lag–lead compensator. Then we present the lag–lead compensation technique based on the frequencyresponse approach.  \n\nCharacteristic of Lag–Lead Compensator.

(This is not necessary. We can, of course, choose $\\gamma\\neq\\beta.$ ) In what follows, we shall consider the case where $\\gamma\\,=\\,\\beta.$ .The polar plot of the lag–lead compensator with $K_{c}=1$ and $\\gamma=\\beta$ becomes as shown in Figure 7–109. It can be seen that, for $0\\,<\\,\\omega\\,<\\,\\omega_{1}$ ,the compensator acts as a lag compensator, while for $\\omega_{1}<\\omega<\\infty$ it acts as a lead compensator. The frequency $\\omega_{1}$ is the frequency at which the phase angle is zero. It is given by  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T_{1}T_{2}}}}\n$$  \n\n(To derive this equation, see Problem A–7–21 .)  \n\nFigure 7–110 shows the Bode diagram of a lag–lead compensator when $K_{c}=1$ ,$\\gamma=\\beta=10$ ,and $T_{2}=10T_{1}$ .Notice that the magnitude curve has the value 0 dB at the low- and high-frequency regions.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections: the top section displays a decibel (dB) scale on the y-axis, ranging from -90 dB to 10 dB, while the x-axis represents frequency in rad/sec. The bottom section features an amplitude response plot, showcasing the magnitude of a signal over various frequencies.\n\n**Top Section: Decibel Scale**\n\n*   **Y-Axis:** dB scale with tick marks at -90 dB, -60 dB, -30 dB, 0 dB, and 10 dB.\n*   **X-Axis:** Frequency in rad/sec, spanning from 1e-3 to 1e5.\n\n**Bottom Section: Amplitude Response Plot**\n\n*   **Magnitude vs. Frequency:** A curve illustrating the magnitude of a signal at different frequencies.\n*   **Frequency Range:** The plot covers a range from approximately 10^-2 to 10^4 rad/sec.\n\nIn summary, the graph provides a visual representation of how the magnitude of a signal changes across various frequencies, with the top section offering a reference for decibel values and the bottom section displaying the amplitude response over a wide frequency range. 7–110 Bode diagram of a lag–lead compensator given by Equation (7–27) with $K_{c}=1$ ,$\\gamma=\\beta=10$ ,and $T_{2}=10T_{1}$ .  \n\nLag–Lead Compensation Based on the Frequency-Response Approach. The design of a lag–lead compensator by the frequency-response approach is based on the combination of the design techniques discussed under lead compensation and lag compensation.  \n\nLet us assume that the lag–lead compensator is of the following form:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\,{\\frac{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}{\\displaystyle{\\left({\\frac{T_{1}}{\\beta}}\\,s\\,+\\,1\\right)}(\\beta T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}}\\,=\\,K_{c}\\,{\\frac{\\displaystyle{\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T_{1}}}\\right)}\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T_{2}}}\\right)}{\\displaystyle{\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{\\beta}{T_{1}}}\\right)}\\left(s\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}}\\right)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\beta>1.$ The phase-lead portion of the lag–lead compensator (the portion involving $T_{1}$ ) alters the frequency-response curve by adding phase-lead angle and increasing the phase margin at the gain crossover frequency.The phase-lag portion (the portion involving $T_{2}$ ) provides attenuation near and above the gain crossover frequency and thereby allows an increase of gain at the low-frequency range to improve the steady-state performance.  \n\nWe shall illustrate the details of the procedures for designing a lag–lead compensator by an example.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 7–28  \n\nConsider the unity-feedback system whose open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}\n$$  \n\nIt is desired that the static velocity error constant be $10\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ ,the phase margin be $50^{\\circ}$ , and the gain margin be $10\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ or more.  \n\nAssume that we use the lag–lead compensator given by Equation (7–28).[Note that the phaselead portion increases both the phase margin and the system bandwidth (which implies increasing the speed of response).The phase-lag portion maintains the low-frequency gain.]  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ .Since the gain $K$ of the plant is adjustable, let us assume that $K_{c}=1$ .Then, $\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,1$ From the requirement on the static velocity error constant, we obtain  \n\n$$\nK_{v}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)\\,\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}=\\frac{K}{2}=10\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\nK=20\n$$  \n\nWe shall next draw the Bode diagram of the uncompensated system with $K=20$ ,as shown in Figure 7–111. The phase margin of the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is found to be $-32^{\\circ}$ , which indicates that the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is unstable.  \n\nThe next step in the design of a lag–lead compensator is to choose a new gain crossover frequency.From the phase-angle curve for $G(j\\omega)$ ,we notice that $/G(j\\omega)=-180^{\\circ}$ at $\\omega=1.5\\,\\mathrm{rad/sec}$ .It is convenient to choose the new gain crossover frequency to be 1.5 rad 'sec so that the phaselead angle required at $\\omega=1.5\\;\\mathrm{rad/sec}$ is about $50^{\\circ}$ , which is quite possible by use of a single lag–lead network.  \n\nOnce we choose the gain crossover frequency to be 1.5 rad 'sec, we can determine the corner frequency of the phase-lag portion of the lag–lead compensator. Let us choose the corner frequency $\\omega=1/T_{2}$ (which corresponds to the zero of the phase-lag portion of the compensator) to be 1 decade below the new gain crossover frequency, or at $\\omega=0.15$ rad 'sec.  \n\nThe image presents two graphs, each displaying a set of curves representing frequency response data. The top graph shows the magnitude response, while the bottom graph displays the phase response.\n\n**Graphs and Axes**\n\n*   **Top Graph (Magnitude Response)**\n    *   Y-axis: dB\n    *   X-axis: rad/sec\n    *   Curves:\n        *   G\n        *   GcG\n        *   Gc\n*   **Bottom Graph (Phase Response)**\n    *   Y-axis: degrees\n    *   X-axis: rad/sec\n    *   Curves:\n        *   Gc\n        *   GG\n\n**Curves and Labels**\n\nThe top graph features three curves:\n\n*   G: A solid line representing the magnitude response of system G.\n*   GcG: A dashed line indicating the magnitude response of the cascaded systems GC and G.\n*   Gc: A dotted line showing the magnitude response of system Gc.\n\nSimilarly, the bottom graph displays two curves:\n\n*   Gc: A solid line representing the phase response of system Gc.\n*   GG: A dashed line indicating the phase response of the cascaded systems GC and G.\n\n**Labels and Annotations**\n\nThe graphs include various labels and annotations to provide context and clarify the relationships between the different systems. These include:\n\n*   The x-axis is labeled \"ω\" in rad/sec, indicating that the frequency response data is plotted against angular frequency.\n*   The y-axis of the top graph is labeled \"dB\", while the y-axis of the bottom graph is labeled \"degrees\".\n*   Arrows are used to connect corresponding curves between the two graphs, highlighting the relationships between the magnitude and phase responses.\n\n**Overall Impression**\n\nThe image effectively conveys complex frequency response data in a clear and concise manner. The use of different line styles and colors helps to distinguish between the various systems being compared, making it easier to analyze and interpret the results. 7–111 Bode diagrams for $G$ (gain-adjusted but uncompensated open-loop transfer function), $G_{c}$ (compensator), and $G_{c}G$ (compensated open-loop transfer function).  \n\nRecall that for the lead compensator the maximum phase-lead angle $\\phi_{m}$ is given by Equation (7–25), where $\\alpha$ is $1/\\beta$ in the present case. By substituting $\\alpha=1/\\beta$ in Equation (7–25), we have  \n\n$$\n\\sin\\phi_{m}=\\frac{1-\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\beta}}{1+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\beta}}=\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\beta+1}\n$$  \n\nNotice that $\\beta=10$ corresponds to $\\phi_{m}=54.9^{\\circ}$ . Since we need a $50^{\\circ}$ phase margin, we may choose $\\beta=10.$ . (Note that we will be using several degrees less than the maximum angle, $54.9^{\\circ}$ .) Thus,  \n\n$$\n\\beta=10\n$$  \n\nThen the corner frequency $\\omega\\,=\\,1/\\beta T_{2}$ (which corresponds to the pole of the phase-lag portion of the compensator) becomes $\\omega\\,=\\,0.015$ rad 'sec. The transfer function of the phase-lag portion of the lag–lead compensator then becomes  \n\n$$\n\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.15}{s\\,+\\,0.015}=10\\biggl(\\frac{6.67s\\,+\\,1}{66.7s\\,+\\,1}\\biggr)\n$$  \n\nThe phase-lead portion can be determined as follows: Since the new gain crossover frequency is $\\omega=1.5$ rad 'sec, from Figure $7–111,G(j1.5)$ is found to be 13 dB. Hence, if the lag–lead compensator contributes $-13\\ \\mathrm{dB}$ at $\\omega=1.5$ rad 'sec, then the new gain crossover frequency is as desired. From this requirement, it is possible to draw a straight line of slope $20\\;\\mathrm{dB}_{\\cdot}$ 'decade, passing through the point (1.5 rad 'sec, $-13$ dB). The intersections of this line and the 0-dB line and –20 -dB line determine the corner frequencies. Thus, the corner frequencies for the lead portion are $\\omega\\,=\\,0.7~\\mathrm{rad/sec}$ and $\\omega=7$ rad 'sec. Thus, the transfer function of the lead portion of the lag–lead compensator becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.7}{s\\,+\\,7}}={\\frac{1}{10}}\\left({\\frac{1.43s\\,+\\,1}{0.143s\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\n$$  \n\nCombining the transfer functions of the lag and lead portions of the compensator, we obtain the transfer function of the lag–lead compensator. Since we chose $K_{c}=1$ ,we have  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,{\\bigg(}{\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.7}{s\\,+\\,7}}{\\bigg)}{\\bigg(}{\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.15}{s\\,+\\,0.015}}{\\bigg)}\\,=\\,{\\bigg(}{\\frac{1.43s\\,+\\,1}{0.143s\\,+\\,1}}{\\bigg)}{\\bigg(}{\\frac{6.67s\\,+\\,1}{66.7s\\,+\\,1}}{\\bigg)}\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude and phase-angle curves of the lag–lead compensator just designed are shown in Figure 7–111.The open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\frac{(s\\,+\\,0.7)(s\\,+\\,0.15)20}{(s\\,+\\,7)(s\\,+\\,0.015)s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}\\\\ {=\\frac{10(1.43s\\,+\\,1)(6.67s\\,+\\,1)}{s(0.143s\\,+\\,1)(66.7s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,1)(0.5s\\,+\\,1)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe magnitude and phase-angle curves of the system of Equation (7–29) are also shown in Figure 7–111.The phase margin of the compensated system is $50^{\\circ}$ , the gain margin is $16\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ , and the static velocity error constant is $10\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ . All the requirements are therefore met, and the design has been completed.  \n\nFigure 7–112 shows the polar plots of $G(j\\omega)$ (gain-adjusted but uncompensated open-loop transfer function) and $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ (compensated open-loop transfer function).The $G_{c}(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ locus is tangent to the $M=1.2$ circle at about $\\omega=2$ rad 'sec. Clearly, this indicates that the compensated system has satisfactory relative stability. The bandwidth of the compensated system is slightly larger than 2 rad 'sec.  \n\nThe image depicts a graph with two curves, G and GcG. The x-axis is labeled \"Re\" (real part), and the y-axis is labeled \"Im\" (imaginary part). The graph appears to be a complex plane, where each point represents a complex number.\n\n**Curve G**\n\n*   **Shape**: Curve G is a smooth, continuous curve that starts at the origin (0, 0) and ends at (-1, 2).\n*   **Tangent**: The tangent line at the origin has an angle of -45 degrees with respect to the x-axis.\n*   **Points**: There are several points marked on Curve G, including:\n    *   ω = 0.15: Located in the first quadrant, this point has a real part of approximately 0.15 and an imaginary part of around 1.2.\n    *   ω = 0.2: Situated in the second quadrant, this point has a real part of about -0.8 and an imaginary part of roughly 1.5.\n\n**Curve GcG**\n\n*   **Shape**: Curve GcG is also a smooth, continuous curve that starts at the origin (0, 0) and ends at (-2, 1).\n*   **Tangent**: The tangent line at the origin has an angle of -45 degrees with respect to the x-axis.\n*   **Points**: There are several points marked on Curve GcG, including:\n    *   M = 1.2: Located in the first quadrant, this point has a real part of approximately 1.2 and an imaginary part of around 0.\n    *   ω = 1: Situated in the second quadrant, this point has a real part of about -1 and an imaginary part of roughly 2.\n\n**Additional Features**\n\n*   **Circle**: A circle is drawn with a radius of 1 centered at the origin (0, 0).\n*   **Grid**: The graph features a grid pattern, with tick marks every unit along both axes.\n*   **Labels**: Various labels are placed throughout the graph, including the curve names (G and GcG), point coordinates (ω = 0.15, M = 1.2, etc.), and axis labels (\"Re\" and \"Im\").\n\nIn summary, the image presents two curves, G and GcG, on a complex plane with labeled points and axes. The curves have distinct shapes and tangents at their starting points, and various features such as circles and grids are included for reference. 7–112 Polar plots of $G$ (gain adjusted) and $G_{c}G$ .  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the unit-step response of a compensated system, with the x-axis representing time (in seconds) and the y-axis representing output.

The graph provides a visual representation of how the system responds to an input signal. 7–113 Unit-step response of the compensated system (Example 7–28).  \n\nIn the following we shall examine the transient-response characteristics of the compensated system. (The gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is unstable.) The closed-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{95.381s^{2}\\,+\\,81s\\,+\\,10}{4.7691s^{5}\\,+\\,47.7287s^{4}\\,+\\,110.3026s^{3}\\,+\\,163.724s^{2}\\,+\\,82s\\,+\\,10}}\n$$  \n\nThe unit-step and unit-ramp response curves obtained with MATLAB are shown in Figures 7–113 and 7–114, respectively.  \n\nThe image presents a graph titled \"Unit-Ramp Response of Compensated System,\" which illustrates the output response of a system to a unit ramp input.

The graph clearly illustrates how the output changes as time progresses, providing valuable insights into the system's behavior under various conditions. 7–114 Unit-ramp response of the compensated system (Example 7–28).   \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\n$$\nZ\\mathrm{eros\\;at}\\;s=-0.1499,\\qquad s=-0.6993\n$$  \n\n$$\ns=-0.1785,\\qquad s=-0.5425,\\qquad s=-7.4923\n$$  \n\nThe pole at $s=-0.1785$ and zero at $s=-0.1499$ are located very close to each other. Such a pair of pole and zero produces a long tail of small amplitude in the step response,as seen in Figure 7–113. Also,the pole at $s=-0.5425$ and zero at $s=-0.6993$ are located fairly close to each other.This pair adds amplitude to the long tail.  \n\nSummary of Control Systems Design by Frequency-Response Approach. The last three sections presented detailed procedures for designing lead, lag, and lag–lead compensators by the use of simple examples. We have shown that the design of a compensator to satisfy the given specifications (in terms of the phase margin and gain margin) can be carried out in the Bode diagram in a simple and straightforward manner. It is noted that not every system can be compensated with a lead, lag, or lag–lead compensator. In some cases compensators with complex poles and zeros may be used. For systems that cannot be designed by use of the root-locus or frequencyresponse methods, the pole-placement method may be used. (See Chapter 10.) In a given design problem if both conventional design methods and the pole-placement method can be used, conventional methods (root-locus or frequency-response methods) usually result in a lower-order stable compensator. Note that a satisfactory design of a compensator for a complex system may require a creative application of all available design methods.  \n\n# Comparison of Lead, Lag, and Lag–Lead Compensation  \n\n1. Lead compensation is commonly used for improving stability margins. Lag compensation is used to improve the steady-state performance. Lead compensation achieves the desired result through the merits of its phase-lead contribution,whereas lag compensation accomplishes the result through the merits of its attenuation property at high frequencies.  \n\n2. In some design problems both lead compensation and lag compensation may satisfy the specifications. Lead compensation yields a higher gain crossover frequency than is possible with lag compensation. The higher gain crossover frequency means a larger bandwidth.A large bandwidth means reduction in the settling time. The bandwidth of a system with lead compensation is always greater than that with lag compensation.Therefore, if a large bandwidth or fast response is desired, lead compensation should be employed. If, however, noise signals are present, then a large bandwidth may not be desirable, since it makes the system more susceptible to noise signals because of an increase in the high-frequency gain. Hence, lag compensation should be used for such a case.  \n\n3. Lead compensation requires an additional increase in gain to offset the attenuation inherent in the lead network.This means that lead compensation will require a larger gain than that required by lag compensation.A larger gain, in most cases, implies larger space, greater weight, and higher cost.  \n\n4. Lead compensation may generate large signals in the system. Such large signals are not desirable because they will cause saturation in the system.  \n\n5. Lag compensation reduces the system gain at higher frequencies without reducing the system gain at lower frequencies. Since the system bandwidth is reduced, the system has a slower speed to respond. Because of the reduced high-frequency gain, the total system gain can be increased, and thereby low-frequency gain can be increased and the steady-state accuracy can be improved. Also, any highfrequency noises involved in the system can be attenuated.   \n6. Lag compensation will introduce a pole-zero combination near the origin that will generate a long tail with small amplitude in the transient response.   \n7. If both fast responses and good static accuracy are desired,a lag–lead compensator may be employed.By use of the lag–lead compensator,the low-frequency gain can be increased (which means an improvement in steady-state accuracy), while at the same time the system bandwidth and stability margins can be increased.   \n8. Although a large number of practical compensation tasks can be accomplished with lead, lag, or lag–lead compensators, for complicated systems, simple compensation by use of these compensators may not yield satisfactory results. Then, different compensators having different pole–zero configurations must be employed.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of eight graphs, each featuring a unique waveform and corresponding label. The purpose of these graphs is to illustrate various waveforms that can be used to represent different types of signals or data.\n\nHere are the descriptions of the visual contents:\n\n*   Graph 1:\n    *   The graph features a waveform with a single peak at the center.\n    *   The waveform has a smooth, curved shape and no visible oscillations or fluctuations.\n    *   The x-axis is labeled \"t\" and ranges from 0 to 10 units, while the y-axis is labeled \"c(t)\" and ranges from -1 to 1 unit.\n*   Graph 2:\n    *   This graph displays a waveform with two distinct peaks, one at the beginning and another towards the end of the graph.\n    *   The waveform has a more complex shape compared to Graph 1, with visible oscillations and fluctuations throughout its duration.\n    *   The x-axis is labeled \"t\" and ranges from 0 to 10 units, while the y-axis is labeled \"c(t)\" and ranges from -1 to 1 unit.\n*   Graph 3:\n    *   This graph shows a waveform with a single peak at the center, similar to Graph 1.\n    *   However, this waveform has a more pronounced oscillation pattern compared to Graph 1, with multiple peaks and troughs visible throughout its duration.\n    *   The x-axis is labeled \"t\" and ranges from 0 to 10 units, while the y-axis is labeled \"c(t)\" and ranges from -1 to 1 unit.\n*   Graph 4:\n    *   This graph features a waveform with two distinct peaks, one at the beginning and another towards the end of the graph.\n    *   The waveform has a more complex shape compared to Graphs 1 and 3, with visible oscillations and fluctuations throughout its duration.\n    *   The x-axis is labeled \"t\" and ranges from 0 to 10 units, while the y-axis is labeled \"c(t)\" and ranges from -1 to 1 unit.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a collection of eight graphs that showcase various waveforms with distinct characteristics. Each graph has its unique features, such as the number of peaks, oscillation patterns, and amplitude ranges. These graphs can be used to represent different types of signals or data in various fields, including physics, engineering, and mathematics. 7–115 Unit-step response curves and unit-ramp response curves. (a) Uncompensated system; (b) lead compensated system; (c) lag compensated system; (d) lag–lead compensated system.  \n\nGraphical Comparison. Figure 7–115(a) shows a unit-step response curve and unit-ramp response curve of an uncompensated system.Typical unit-step response and unit-ramp response curves for the compensated system using a lead, lag, and lag–lead compensator, respectively, are shown in Figures 7–115(b), (c), and (d).The system with a lead compensator exhibits the fastest response, while that with a lag compensator exhibits the slowest response, but with marked improvements in the unit-ramp response. The system with a lag–lead compensator will give a compromise; reasonable improvements in both the transient response and steady-state response can be expected. The response curves shown depict the nature of improvements that may be expected from using different types of compensators.  \n\nFeedback Compensation. A tachometer is one of the rate feedback devices. Another common rate feedback device is the rate gyro. Rate gyros are commonly used in aircraft autopilot systems.  \n\nVelocity feedback using a tachometer is very commonly used in positional servo systems. It is noted that, if the system is subjected to noise signals, velocity feedback may generate some difficulty if a particular velocity feedback scheme performs differentiation of the output signal. (The result is the accentuation of the noise effects.)  \n\nCancellation of Undesirable Poles. Since the transfer function of elements in cascade is the product of their individual transfer functions, it is possible to cancel some undesirable poles or zeros by placing a compensating element in cascade, with its poles and zeros being adjusted to cancel the undesirable poles or zeros of the original system. For example, a large time constant $T_{1}$ may be canceled by use of the lead network $\\left(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1\\right)\\!\\dot{/}\\!\\left(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1\\right)$ as follows:  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of a system, comprising various equations and diagrams. The purpose of the image is to illustrate the relationships between different variables within this system.\n\n* A graph with a line and an arrow:\n\t+ The graph features a single curve that appears to be increasing.\n\t+ An arrow points from the origin (0, 0) to the top-right corner of the graph.\n* A diagram with two boxes and arrows:\n\t+ Two rectangular boxes are connected by arrows, indicating the flow of information or processes between them.\n\t+ The left box has a label that reads \"T1s + 1\", while the right box is labeled \"T2t\".\n\t+ Arrows point from the top-left corner to the center of the left box and from the center of the right box to the bottom-right corner.\n* A mathematical equation:\n\t+ The equation is written in a simple, linear form: x = 1 / (T1s + 1).\n\t+ It suggests that the variable x is dependent on the values of T1 and s.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a system with multiple components, including graphs, diagrams, and mathematical equations. These elements work together to represent complex relationships between variables and processes within the system. 7–116 Step-response curves showing the effect of canceling a large time constant.  \n\n$$\n\\left({\\frac{1}{T_{1}s\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\left({\\frac{T_{1}s\\,+\\,1}{T_{2}s\\,+\\,1}}\\right)\\,={\\frac{1}{T_{2}s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nIf $T_{2}$ is much smaller than $T_{1}$ ,we can effectively eliminate the large time constant $T_{1}$ .Figure 7–116 shows the effect of canceling a large time constant in step transient response.  \n\nIf an undesirable pole in the original system lies in the right-half $s$ plane, this compensation scheme should not be used since, although mathematically it is possible to cancel the undesirable pole with an added zero, exact cancellation is physically impossible because of inaccuracies involved in the location of the poles and zeros. A pole in the right-half $s$ plane not exactly canceled by the compensator zero will eventually lead to unstable operation, because the response will involve an exponential term that increases with time.  \n\nIt is noted that if a left-half plane pole is almost canceled but not exactly canceled, as is almost always the case, the uncanceled pole-zero combination will cause the response to have a small amplitude but long-lasting transient-response component. If the cancellation is not exact but is reasonably good, then this component will be small.  \n\nIt should be noted that the ideal control system is not the one that has a transfer function of unity. Physically, such a control system cannot be built since it cannot instantaneously transfer energy from the input to the output. In addition, since noise is almost always present in one form or another, a system with a unity transfer function is not desirable. A desired control system, in many practical cases, may have one set of dominant complex-conjugate closed-loop poles with a reasonable damping ratio and undamped natural frequency.The determination of the significant part of the closed-loop pole-zero configuration, such as the location of the dominant closed-loop poles, is based on the specifications that give the required system performance.  \n\nCancellation of Undesirable Complex-Conjugate Poles. If the transfer function of a plant contains one or more pairs of complex-conjugate poles, then a lead, lag, or lag–lead compensator may not give satisfactory results. In such a case, a network that has two zeros and two poles may prove to be useful. If the zeros are chosen so as to cancel the undesirable complex-conjugate poles of the plant, then we can essentially replace the undesirable poles by acceptable poles. That is, if the undesirable complexconjugate poles are in the left-half $s$ plane and are in the form  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta_{1}\\omega_{1}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{1}^{2}}\n$$  \n\nthen the insertion of a compensating network having the transfer function  \n\n$$\n\\frac{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta_{1}\\omega_{1}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{1}^{2}}{s^{2}\\,+\\,2\\zeta_{2}\\omega_{2}s\\,+\\,\\omega_{2}^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwill result in an effective change of the undesirable complex-conjugate poles to acceptable poles. Note that even though the cancellation may not be exact, the compensated system will exhibit better response characteristics. (As stated earlier, this approach cannot be used if the undesirable complex-conjugate poles are in the righthalf $s$ plane.)  \n\nFamiliar networks consisting only of $R C$ components whose transfer functions possess two zeros and two poles are the bridged${\\cal T}$ networks. Examples of bridged${\\cal T}$ networks and their transfer functions are shown in Figure 7–117. (The derivations of the transfer functions of the bridged${\\cal T}$ networks were given in Problem A–3–5 .)  \n\nThe image presents two equivalent circuit diagrams, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to be related to electrical engineering or electronics. The diagrams are rendered in black on a white background.\n\n**Diagram (a)**\n\n*   This diagram features a simple circuit with two resistors (R1 and R2), one capacitor (C1), and an unspecified component at the top, connected by wires.\n    *   The components are arranged horizontally across the page, with arrows indicating the direction of current flow.\n    *   The circuit is labeled \"Eo(s) = RC1RC2s^2 + 2RC1Cs + 1\" and \"Ei(s) = Eo(s)/EC1\", suggesting a relationship between the output voltage (Eo) and input voltage (Ei).\n*   The diagram includes mathematical equations for calculating the transfer function of the circuit, represented by the variable s.\n\n**Diagram (b)**\n\n*   This diagram depicts a more complex circuit with multiple components, including resistors (R1, R2, and R3), capacitors (C1 and C2), and an unspecified component at the top.\n    *   The components are arranged vertically across the page, with arrows indicating the direction of current flow.\n    *   The circuit is labeled \"Eo(s) = RC1CR2Cs^2 + 2RC1Cs + 1\" and \"Ei(s) = Eo(s)/EC1\", similar to diagram (a).\n*   The diagram includes additional mathematical equations for calculating the transfer function of the circuit, represented by the variable s.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n*   Both diagrams feature a similar layout and labeling scheme, suggesting they represent related concepts or applications.\n*   The use of complex mathematical equations implies that these diagrams are intended for technical analysis or design purposes rather than purely illustrative ones.\n*   The presence of unspecified components at the top of each diagram may indicate missing information or simplifications in the representation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe image presents two equivalent circuit diagrams, likely related to electrical engineering or electronics. While the exact purpose or application of these diagrams is unclear without additional context, they appear to be used for analyzing or designing electronic circuits. The presence of mathematical equations and unspecified components suggests a focus on technical analysis rather than pure illustration. 7–117 Bridged$\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\boldsymbol{T}$ networks.  \n\nConcluding Comments. In the design examples presented in this chapter, we have been primarily concerned only with the transfer functions of compensators. In actual design problems, we must choose the hardware. Thus, we must satisfy additional design constraints such as cost, size, weight, and reliability.  \n\nThe system designed may meet the specifications under normal operating conditions but may deviate considerably from the specifications when environmental changes are considerable. Since the changes in the environment affect the gain and time constants of the system, it is necessary to provide automatic or manual means to adjust the gain to compensate for such environmental changes, for nonlinear effects that were not taken into account in the design, and also to compensate for manufacturing tolerances from unit to unit in the production of system components. (The effects of manufacturing tolerances are suppressed in a closed-loop system; therefore, the effects may not be critical in closed-loop operation but critical in open-loop operation.) In addition to this, the designer must remember that any system is subject to small variations due mainly to the normal deterioration of the system.  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–7–1. Consider a system whose closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{10(s\\,+\\,1)}{(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,5)}\n$$  \n\nClearly, the closed-loop poles are located at $s=-2$ and $s=-5$ , and the system is not oscillatory. Show that the closed-loop frequency response of this system will exhibit a resonant peak, although the damping ratio of the closed-loop poles is greater than unity.  \n\nSolution. Figure 7–118 shows the Bode diagram for the system. The resonant peak value is approximately 3.5 dB. (Note that, in the absence of a zero, the second-order system with $\\zeta>0.7$ will not exhibit a resonant peak; however, the presence of a closed-loop zero will cause such a peak.)  \n\nThe image depicts a graph featuring two distinct lines, labeled as \"Asymptote\" and positioned at different y-values on the y-axis. The x-axis displays frequency measurements ranging from 0.2 to 40 rad/sec, while the y-axis measures magnitude values between -90 dB and 15 dB.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Asymptote Line:** This line is situated above the graph's origin at a y-value of approximately 5 dB.\n* **Graph Lines:** Two lines are plotted on the graph:\n\t+ One line originates from the lower left corner, crossing the x-axis around 0.2 rad/sec and reaching its peak magnitude value of approximately 10 dB before decreasing to approximately -5 dB as it approaches the right end of the graph.\n\t+ The second line begins at a y-value of approximately 1 dB in the upper right section of the graph, with a steeper slope than the first line. As it moves towards the left, it intersects the x-axis around 0.2 rad/sec and descends to approximately -5 dB.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n\n* The graph features an additional feature on the y-axis, where measurements are taken in decibels (dB).\n* A dashed line is visible near the x-axis, but its purpose or meaning is unclear due to insufficient context.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a graph with two plotted lines and an asymptote, along with an additional feature on the y-axis. The lines exhibit distinct behaviors as they approach the ends of the graph, while the asymptote remains constant at a y-value of approximately 5 dB.  \n\nFigure 7–118   \nBode diagram for   \n$10(1\\,+\\,j\\bar{\\omega})/\\big[(2\\,+\\,j\\omega)(5\\,+\\,j\\omega)\\big].$  \n\nA–7–2.

Referring to Problem A–7–2, plot Bode diagrams for the system, using MATLAB.  \n\nSolution. MATLAB Program 7–15 produces Bode diagrams for the system. There are four sets of Bode diagrams: two for input 1 and two for input 2. These Bode diagrams are shown in Figure 7–119.  \n\nThe image shows a piece of code written in MATLAB, with the title \"MATLAB Program 7-15\" at the top. The purpose of this code is to create a program that can be run using the MATLAB software.\n\nHere are the details of the code:\n\n* A = [0 1;-25 -4]\n\t+ This line creates a matrix A with two rows and two columns.\n\t+ The first row has values 0 and 1, separated by a space.\n\t+ The second row has values -25 and -4, also separated by a space.\n\t+ The semicolon at the end of this line indicates that it is a separate statement from the previous one.\n* B = [1 1;0 1]\n\t+ This line creates another matrix B with two rows and two columns.\n\t+ The first row has values 1 and 1, separated by a space.\n\t+ The second row also has values 0 and 1, again separated by a space.\n\t+ Like before, the semicolon at the end of this line indicates that it is a separate statement from the previous one.\n* C = [1 0;0 1]\n\t+ This line creates yet another matrix C with two rows and two columns.\n\t+ The first row has values 1 and 0, separated by a space.\n\t+ The second row has values 0 and 1, once more separated by a space.\n\t+ Again, the semicolon at the end of this line indicates that it is a separate statement from the previous one.\n* D = [0 0;0 0]\n\t+ This line creates a final matrix D with two rows and two columns.\n\t+ Both rows consist entirely of zeros, separated by spaces.\n\nIn summary, this code defines four matrices A, B, C, and D using matrix notation. The matrices are all 2x2 in size and contain various combinations of zeros and ones. There is no apparent logical connection between these matrices or any specific operation being performed on them within the given context.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive comparison of two distinct systems, denoted as U1 and U2, through Bode diagrams. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the frequency response of each system, showcasing their respective magnitude and phase characteristics.\n\n**System 1 (U1):**\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot:**\n    *   The magnitude plot for U1 exhibits a gradual decrease in amplitude as frequency increases.\n    *   The graph starts at approximately -20 dB at a low frequency range (around 10 rad/s) and decreases to around -40 dB at higher frequencies (beyond 1000 rad/s).\n*   **Phase Plot:**\n    *   The phase plot for U1 displays a relatively flat response across the entire frequency range, with minimal variation in phase angle.\n\n**System 2 (U2):**\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot:**\n    *   In contrast to U1, the magnitude plot for U2 shows a more pronounced decrease in amplitude as frequency increases.\n    *   The graph starts at approximately -30 dB at low frequencies and drops to around -60 dB at higher frequencies (beyond 1000 rad/s).\n*   **Phase Plot:**\n    *   Similar to U1, the phase plot for U2 also exhibits a relatively flat response across the frequency range, with minimal variation in phase angle.\n\n**Comparison of Systems:**\n\n*   Both systems exhibit a gradual decrease in amplitude as frequency increases.\n*   However, System 2 (U2) displays a more significant reduction in magnitude compared to System 1 (U1).\n*   The phase plots for both systems show minimal variation in phase angle across the entire frequency range.\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagrams provide a detailed comparison of the frequency response characteristics of Systems U1 and U2. While both systems exhibit similar trends, System U2 demonstrates a more pronounced decrease in amplitude at higher frequencies. 7–119 Bode diagrams.  \n\nFigure 7–120 Closed-loop system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, featuring two primary components: an input signal (R(s)) and an output signal (C(s)). The objective is to analyze this block diagram and provide a detailed description.\n\n*   **Input Signal (R(s)):**\n    *   Represented by the symbol \"R(s)\" on the left side of the diagram.\n    *   Indicates that the system's input is represented in the Laplace domain.\n    *   No further details are provided about the nature or characteristics of this input signal.\n*   **Block Diagram:**\n    *   Comprises a single block labeled as \"(K/(s+1)(s+5))\".\n    *   Features two inputs and one output:\n        *   The input on the left is R(s).\n        *   The input on the right is not explicitly shown but can be inferred to involve some form of feedback or signal manipulation.\n        *   The output from the block feeds into C(s), which represents the system's response in the Laplace domain.\n    *   The block itself is defined by its transfer function, K/(s+1)(s+5), suggesting a simple first-order system with damping characteristics influenced by both poles at s = -1 and s = -5.\n*   **Output Signal (C(s)):**\n    *   Represented by the symbol \"C(s)\" on the right side of the diagram.\n    *   Indicates that the system's output is also represented in the Laplace domain.\n    *   Similar to R(s), no specific information is provided about the nature or characteristics of this output signal.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a basic control system configuration with an input and output both described in the Laplace domain. The transfer function of the system implies it acts as a low-pass filter due to its pole placement, significantly attenuating high-frequency components while allowing lower frequencies to pass through with minimal distortion. However, without additional context or specifics on the constants involved (e.g., K), precise performance characteristics cannot be deduced beyond this general understanding.  \n\nA–7–4.

The use of comments and clear formatting makes it easy to follow along with the program's logic and understand its purpose.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: a gain plot and a phase plot.\n\n*   **Gain Plot**\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency (rad/sec) ranging from 10^-1 to 10^2.\n    *   The y-axis represents gain in decibels (dB) ranging from -140 to 20.\n    *   Three curves are plotted:\n        *   K = 1: This curve shows the gain of the system when the gain parameter K is set to 1. It has a peak at around 10 rad/sec with a gain of approximately 0 dB.\n        *   K = 10: This curve represents the gain of the system when the gain parameter K is set to 10. The curve shows a significant increase in gain compared to the K = 1 curve, peaking at around 20 dB at 10 rad/sec.\n        *   K = 20: Similarly, this curve depicts the gain of the system with the gain parameter K set to 20. It exhibits an even greater increase in gain than the K = 10 curve, reaching a peak of about 40 dB at 10 rad/sec.\n    *   The gain plot indicates that as the gain parameter increases, the magnitude of the system's frequency response also increases, particularly around 10 rad/sec.\n*   **Phase Plot**\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency (rad/sec) ranging from 10^-1 to 10^2.\n    *   The y-axis represents phase in degrees ranging from -300 to 0.\n    *   Three curves are plotted:\n        *   K = 1: This curve shows the phase response of the system when the gain parameter K is set to 1. It exhibits a gradual decrease in phase as frequency increases, starting at around -270° and approaching 0° at higher frequencies.\n        *   K = 10: The curve for K = 10 displays a similar trend to the K = 1 curve but with a more pronounced decrease in phase across the frequency range. It starts at approximately -300° and approaches 0° as frequency increases.\n        *   K = 20: This curve shows an even steeper decrease in phase compared to the other two curves, starting at around -330° and approaching 0° at higher frequencies.\n    *   The phase plot reveals that increasing the gain parameter results in a more rapid decrease in phase across the frequency range.\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagram illustrates how varying the gain parameter affects the magnitude and phase of the system's frequency response. As the gain increases from K = 1 to K = 20, both the magnitude (gain) and phase characteristics of the system exhibit significant changes, particularly around 10 rad/sec. 7–121 Bode diagrams: (a) Magnitudeversus-frequency curves; (b) phaseangle-versusfrequency curves.  \n\nA–7–5. Prove that the polar plot of the sinusoidal transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{j\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\mathrm{for}\\;0\\leq\\omega\\leq\\infty\n$$  \n\nis a semicircle. Find the center and radius of the circle.  \n\nSolution. The given sinusoidal transfer function $G(j\\omega)$ can be written as follows:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\,X\\,+\\,j Y\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nX={\\frac{\\omega^{2}T^{2}}{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}},\\qquad Y={\\frac{\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}}}\n$$  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\n\\left(X\\,-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\,+\\,Y^{2}=\\frac{{\\left(\\omega^{2}T^{2}\\,-\\,1\\right)}^{2}}{4{\\left(1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}\\right)}^{2}}+\\frac{\\omega^{2}T^{2}}{{\\left(1\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}T^{2}\\right)}^{2}}=\\frac{1}{4}\n$$  \n\nHence, we see that the plot of $G(j\\omega)$ is a circle centered at (0.5,0) with radius equal to 0.5. The upper semicircle corresponds to $0\\,\\leq\\,\\omega\\,\\leq\\,\\infty$ , and the lower semicircle corresponds to $-\\infty\\leq\\omega\\leq0$ .  \n\nA–7–6. Prove the following mapping theorem: Let $F(s)$ be a ratio of polynomials in $s$ . Let $P$ be the number of poles and $Z$ be the number of zeros of $F(s)$ that lie inside a closed contour in the $s$ plane, with multiplicity accounted for. Let the closed contour be such that it does not pass through any poles or zeros of $F(s)$ .The closed contour in the $s$ plane then maps into the $F(s)$ plane as a closed curve.The number $N$ of clockwise encirclements of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane, as a representative point $s$ traces out the entire contour in the $s$ plane in the clockwise direction, is equal to $Z\\mathrm{~-~}P$ .  \n\nSolution. To prove this theorem, we use Cauchy’s theorem and the residue theorem. Cauchy’s theorem states that the integral of $F(s)$ around a closed contour in the $s$ plane is zero if $F(s)$ is analytic #within and on the closed contour, or  \n\n$$\n\\oint\\!F(s)\\,d s\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nSuppose that $F(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nF(s)\\,=\\frac{(s\\,+\\,z_{1})^{k_{1}}(s\\,+\\,z_{2})^{k_{2}}\\cdots}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})^{m_{1}}(s\\,+\\,p_{2})^{m_{2}}\\cdots}X(s)\n$$  \n\nwhere $X(s)$ is analytic in the closed contour in the $s$ plane and all the poles and zeros are located in the contour.Then the ratio $F^{\\prime}(s)/F(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s)}{F(s)}}=\\left({\\frac{k_{1}}{s+z_{1}}}+{\\frac{k_{2}}{s+z_{2}}}+\\cdots\\right)-\\left({\\frac{m_{1}}{s+p_{1}}}+{\\frac{m_{2}}{s+p_{2}}}+\\cdots\\right)+{\\frac{X^{\\prime}(s)}{X(s)}}\n$$  \n\nThis may be seen from the following consideration: If ${\\hat{F}}(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\hat{F}(s)\\,=\\,(s\\,+\\,z_{1})^{k}X(s)\n$$  \n\nthen ${\\hat{F}}(s)$ has a zero of $k$ th order at $s=-z_{1}$ . Differentiating $F(s)$ with respect to $s$ yields  \n\n$$\n{\\hat{F}}^{\\prime}(s)\\,=\\,k{\\left(s\\,+\\,z_{1}\\right)}^{k-1}X(s)\\,+\\,{\\left(s\\,+\\,z_{1}\\right)}^{k}X^{\\prime}(s)\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{{\\hat{F}}^{\\prime}(s)}{{\\hat{F}}(s)}}={\\frac{k}{s\\,+\\,z_{1}}}+{\\frac{X^{\\prime}(s)}{X(s)}}\n$$  \n\nWe see that by taking the ratio $\\hat{F}^{\\prime}(s)/\\hat{F}\\left(s\\right)$ , the $k$ th-order zero of ${\\hat{F}}(s)$ becomes a simple pole of $\\hat{F}^{\\prime}(s)/\\hat{F}\\left(s\\right)$ .  \n\n#For the definition of an analytic function, see the footnote on page 447.  \n\nIf the last term on the right-hand side of Equation (7–31) does not contain any poles or zeros in the closed contour in the $s$ plane, $F^{\\prime}(s)/F(s)$ is analytic in this contour except at point $s=-z_{1}$ .Then, referring to Equation (7–30) and using the residue theorem, which states that the integral of $F^{\\prime}(s)/F(s)$ taken in the clockwise direction around a closed contour in the $s$ plane is equal to $-2\\pi j$ times the residues at the simple poles of $F^{\\prime}(s)/F(s)$ , or  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\oint\\!{\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s)}{F(s)}}\\,d s=-2\\pi j\\Big(\\sum\\mathrm{\\residues}\\Big)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n\\oint\\!{\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s)}{F(s)}}\\,d s=-2\\pi j\\big[\\big(k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots\\big)-\\big(m_{1}+m_{2}+\\cdots\\big)\\big]=-2\\pi j(Z-P)\n$$  \n\nwhere $Z=k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots=$ total number of zeros of $F(s)$ enclosed in the closed contour in the $s$ plane  \n\n[The $k$ multiple zeros (or poles) are considered $k$ zeros (or poles) located at the same point.] Since $F(s)$ is a complex quantity, $F(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\nF(s)\\,=\\,|F|e^{j\\theta}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\ln F(s)\\,=\\,\\ln|F|\\,+\\,j\\theta\n$$  \n\nNoting that $F^{\\prime}(s)/F(s)$ can be written  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s)}{F(s)}}={\\frac{d\\ln F(s)}{d s}}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s)}{F(s)}}={\\frac{d\\ln|F|}{d s}}+j\\,{\\frac{d\\theta}{d s}}\n$$  \n\nIf the closed contour in the $s$ plane is mapped into the closed contour $\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{\\Pi}}_{T}$ in the $F(s)$ plane, then  \n\n$$\n\\oint\\frac{F^{\\prime}(s)}{F(s)}\\,d s\\,=\\,\\oint_{\\cal P}d\\ln|F|\\,+\\,j\\oint_{\\cal P}d\\theta\\,=\\,j\\int\\,d\\theta\\,=\\,2\\pi j({\\cal P}\\,-\\,Z)\n$$  \n\nThe integral $\\oint_{T}d\\ln|F|$ is zero since the magnitude $\\ln\\vert F\\vert$ is the same at the initial point and the final point of the contour $T.$ Thus we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\theta_{2}\\,-\\,\\theta_{1}}{2\\pi}}=P\\,-\\,Z\n$$  \n\nThe angular difference between the final and initial values of $\\theta$ is equal to the total change in the phase angle of $F^{\\prime}(s)/F(s)$ as a representative point in the $s$ plane moves along the closed contour. Noting that $N$ is the number of clockwise encirclements of the origin of the $F(s)$ plane and $\\theta_{2}\\mathrm{~-~}\\theta_{1}$ is zero or a multiple of $2\\pi$ rad, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta_{2}\\,-\\,\\theta_{1}}{2\\pi}=-N\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive diagram illustrating the concept of origin encirclement in complex analysis, featuring three distinct sections: a circle, a line graph, and an equation. The diagram is carefully labeled to facilitate understanding.\n\n**Circle Diagram**\n\n*   A circle with a radius of 1 unit is depicted.\n*   Two points on the real axis, labeled as $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, are marked at angles corresponding to the real part of a complex number.\n*   An arrow indicates the direction of increasing angle around the circle.\n*   The equation $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + i\\sin{\\theta}$ is inscribed on the diagram.\n\n**Line Graph**\n\n*   A graph with two axes, labeled as \"Real\" and \"Imaginary\", is displayed.\n*   Two lines intersecting at a point (0,1) form an angle $\\pi/2$ radians.\n*   The real axis runs horizontally from left to right, while the imaginary axis runs vertically upwards.\n\n**Equation**\n\n*   An equation $F(s)$ is written in the middle of the image.\n*   Below this equation, another expression $\\theta_2 - \\theta_1 = 2\\pi$ is provided.\n\nThe diagram effectively illustrates the concept of origin encirclement by tracing a circle centered at the origin with an angle equal to twice the difference between two angles. This visual representation facilitates understanding of the relationship between the complex number and its corresponding polar form. 7–122 Determination of encirclement of the origin of $F(s)$ plane.  \n\nThus, we have the relationship  \n\n$$\nN\\,=\\,Z\\,-\\,P\n$$  \n\nThis proves the theorem.  \n\nNote that by this mapping theorem,the exact numbers of zeros and of poles cannot be found— only their difference. Note also that, from Figures 7–122(a) and (b), we see that if $\\theta$ does not change through $2\\pi$ rad, then the origin of the $F(s)$ plane cannot be encircled.  \n\nA–7–7. The Nyquist plot (polar plot) of the open-loop frequency response of a unity-feedback control system is shown in Figure 7–123(a). Assuming that the Nyquist path in the $s$ plane encloses the entire right-half $s$ plane, draw a complete Nyquist plot in the $G$ plane.Then answer the following questions:  \n\n(a) If the open-loop transfer function has no poles in the right-half $s$ plane, is the closed-loop system stable?   \n(b) If the open-loop transfer function has one pole and no zeros in right-half $s$ plane,is the closedloop system stable?   \n(c) If the open-loop transfer function has one zero and no poles in the right-half $s$ plane, is the closed-loop system stable?  \n\nThe image presents two distinct graphs, labeled (a) and (b), each displaying a unique set of data.\n\n**Graph (a)**\n\n*   The graph features a single curve with an x-axis ranging from -1 to 0.\n*   The y-axis spans from approximately -6 to 5.\n*   A prominent peak is visible at the origin, accompanied by a trough around -1 on the x-axis.\n*   The curve exhibits a gentle slope between these two points before increasing sharply towards the right.\n\n**Graph (b)**\n\n*   This graph depicts a circle with an x-axis ranging from approximately -5 to 4 and a y-axis spanning from -3 to 3.\n*   A single point, marked \"G Plane,\" is plotted on the circle at coordinates (-1,0).\n*   Several lines radiate from this point, intersecting with the circle's circumference and forming a series of angles.\n\nIn summary, the image comprises two graphs: one displaying a curve with a peak and trough, and another featuring a circle with multiple lines intersecting its perimeter. 7–123 (a) Nyquist plot; (b) complete Nyquist plot in the $G$ plane.   \nChapter 7 /Control Systems Analysis and Design by the Frequency-Response Method  \n\nSolution. Figure 7–123(b) shows a complete Nyquist plot in the $G$ plane.The answers to the three questions are as follows:  \n\n(a) The closed-loop system is stable, because the critical point $(-1+j0)$ is not encircled by the Nyquist plot.That is, since $P=0$ and $N=0$ , we have $Z=N\\,+\\,P\\,=\\,0$ .  \n(b) The open-loop transfer function has one pole in the right-half $s$ plane. Hence, $P=1$ . (The open-loop system is unstable.) For the closed-loop system to be stable, the Nyquist plot must encircle the critical point $(-1+j0)$ once counterclockwise. However, the Nyquist plot does not encircle the critical point.Hence, $N=0,$ .Therefore, $Z=N+P=1.$ The closed-loop system is unstable.   \n(c) Since the open-loop transfer function has one zero, but no poles, in the right-half $s$ plane, we have $Z\\,=\\,N\\,+\\,P\\,=\\,0.$ Thus, the closed-loop system is stable. (Note that the zeros of the open-loop transfer function do not affect the stability of the closed-loop system.)  \n\nA–7–8. Is a closed-loop system with the following open-loop transfer function and with $K=2$ stable?  \n\n$$\nG(s)H(s)={\\frac{K}{s(s+1)(2s+1)}}\n$$  \n\nFind the critical value of the gain $K$ for stability.  \n\nSolution. The open-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)=\\frac{K}{j\\omega\\left(j\\omega\\mathrm{~+~}1\\right)\\left(2j\\omega\\mathrm{~+~}1\\right)}}\\\\ {=\\frac{K}{{-3\\omega^{2}\\mathrm{~+~}j\\omega\\big(1\\mathrm{~-~}2\\omega^{2}\\big)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis open-loop transfer function has no poles in the right-half $s$ plane. Thus, for stability, the $-1+j0$ point should not be encircled by the Nyquist plot. Let us find the point where the Nyquist plot crosses the negative real axis. Let the imaginary part of $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ be zero, or  \n\n$$\n1\\,-\\,2\\omega^{2}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nfrom which  \n\n$$\n\\omega=\\pm\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$  \n\nSubstituting $\\omega=1/\\sqrt{2}$ into $G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)$ , we obtain  \n\n$$\nG\\biggl(j\\,{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\biggr)H\\biggl(j\\,{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\biggr)=-\\,{\\frac{2K}{3}}\n$$  \n\nThe critical value of the gain $K$ is obtained by equating $-2K/3$ to $-1$ , or  \n\n$$\n-\\,{\\frac{2}{3}}\\,K=-1\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\nK=\\frac{3}{2}\n$$  \n\nThe system is stable if $0<K<\\frac{3}{2}$ .Hence, the system with $K=2$ is unstable.  \n\nFigure 7–124 Closed-loop system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is used to represent and analyze the behavior of complex systems. The diagram shows the relationships between different components of the system, including inputs, outputs, and feedback loops.\n\n*   **Input (R(s))**: This represents the reference input or setpoint of the system.\n*   **Controller (C(s))**: This block implements the control algorithm that adjusts the output to track the reference input. It is represented by a transfer function C(s), which depends on the specific controller design.\n*   **Plant (G(s))**: This represents the physical process being controlled, such as a mechanical system or an electrical circuit. Its transfer function is denoted as G(s).\n*   **Output (Y(s))**: This is the actual output of the system, which is fed back to the controller.\n\nThe block diagram illustrates how the inputs and outputs are related through the controller and plant dynamics. The closed-loop transfer function of the system can be derived by combining these blocks and analyzing their interactions.\n\nIn this context, the symbol 'K' represents a gain factor that amplifies or attenuates the signal passing through it. This value is usually determined based on design requirements such as stability margins or performance specifications.\n\nOverall, the block diagram provides a concise visual representation of the system's architecture and facilitates analysis and optimization of its behavior.  \n\nA–7–9. Consider the closed-loop system shown in Figure 7–124. Determine the critical value of $K$ for stability by the use of the Nyquist stability criterion.  \n\nSolution. The polar plot of  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{K}{j\\omega\\,-\\,1}\n$$  \n\nis a circle with center at $-K/2$ on the negative real axis and radius $K/2$ , as shown in Figure 7–125(a). As $\\omega$ is increased from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$ , the $G(j\\omega)$ locus makes a counterclockwise rotation. In this system, $P=1$ because there is one pole of $G(s)$ in the right-half $s$ plane. For the closedloop system to be stable, $Z$ must be equal to zero.Therefore, $N=Z\\,-\\,P$ must be equal to $-1$ , or there must be one counterclockwise encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point for stability. (If there is no encirclement of the $-1+j0$ point, the system is unstable.) Thus, for stability, $K$ must be greater than unity,and $K=1$ gives the stability limit.Figure 7–125(b) shows both stable and unstable cases of $G(j\\omega)$ plots.  \n\nThe image presents a diagram illustrating the relationship between complex numbers and their corresponding polar representation. The diagram is divided into two main sections, each containing a distinct set of elements that convey specific information about the properties of these numbers.\n\n*   **Top Section:**\n    *   This section features three concentric circles centered at the origin (0, 0) in the complex plane.\n        *   The innermost circle represents real numbers, which are those with an imaginary component of zero.\n        *   The middle circle signifies purely imaginary numbers, characterized by a real part of zero.\n        *   The outermost circle denotes complex numbers in general, encompassing both real and imaginary components.\n    *   A series of arrows emanate from the origin, connecting each circle to its corresponding polar representation on the right side of the diagram.\n        *   These arrows indicate that as you move along a path in the complex plane, the angle of the vector relative to the positive x-axis (the real axis) determines the polar form of the number.\n*   **Bottom Section:**\n    *   This section displays a similar arrangement of concentric circles, but with additional elements added to convey specific properties and relationships between these numbers.\n        *   The innermost circle remains unchanged, representing real numbers.\n        *   The middle circle now includes small arrows pointing towards the origin, signifying positive imaginary components.\n        *   The outermost circle continues to denote complex numbers in general.\n    *   An arrow points from the outermost circle to a point labeled \"Re\" (real part), and another arrow points from this same point to the innermost circle, indicating that the real part of a complex number is equal to its polar representation.\n\nIn summary, the diagram effectively illustrates how complex numbers can be represented in both rectangular and polar forms. The use of concentric circles and arrows helps visualize the relationships between these different representations, providing a clear understanding of the properties and characteristics of complex numbers. 7–125 (a) Polar plot of $K/(j\\omega\\,-\\,1)$ ;(b) polar plots of $K/(j\\omega\\,-\\,1)$ for stable and unstable cases.  \n\nA–7–10.

The left semicircle has a center at (0, 0) with a radius of 1, while the right semicircle has a center at (1, 0) with a radius of 1.\n\nIn summary, the image shows two semicircles defined by mathematical equations, providing a visual representation of their properties and relationships. 7–126 Polar plots of $2.65e^{-0.8j\\omega}/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega)$ and $2.65/(1\\,+\\,j\\omega)$ .  \n\nA–7–11.

MATLAB Program 7–17 produces the Nyquist diagram shown in Figure 7–127. From this figure, we see that the Nyquist plot does not encircle the $-1+j0$ point. Hence, $N=0$ in the Nyquist stability criterion. Since no open-loop poles lie in the right-half $s$ plane, ${P}=0,$ .Therefore, $Z=N+P=0.$ The closed-loop system is stable.  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet in MATLAB, specifically highlighting a program titled \"MATLAB Program 7-17\".

Drawing a Nyquist plot for only the positive-frequency region can be done by the use of the following command:  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{r e,i m,w}]=\\mathsf{n y q u i s t(n u m,d e n,w)}\n$$  \n\nThe frequency region may be divided into several subregions by using different increments. For example, the frequency region of interest may be divided into three subregions as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathsf{w}1=0.1\\,;0.1\\,;10;}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{w}2=1\\,0;2;100;}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{w}3=1\\,00;10;500;}\\\\ &{\\mathsf{w}}&{=[\\mathsf{w}1\\;\\;\\mathsf{w}2\\;\\;\\mathsf{w}3]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–18 uses this frequency region. Using this program, we obtain the Nyquist plot shown in Figure 7–128.  \n\nThe code snippet provided is a MATLAB script that generates a plot of a function G(s) defined by the equation:\n\n20*(s^2 + s + 0.5)\n\nThe code first defines the variables required for the plot, including the range of values for s and w ( omega ). It then uses these variables to generate the x-axis and y-axis labels, as well as the title of the plot.\n\nTo visualize this script, we need to understand how it works step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**: The first lines define the variable 's' which represents a complex number in MATLAB, allowing for calculations involving real and imaginary parts.\n\n2. **Plotting Function**: The function G(s) = 20*(s^2 + s + 0.5) is defined. This is the equation that will be plotted over the specified range of values for 's'.\n\n3. **Specifying Range**: The range of values for 's' and 'w' (omega, not used in this context but possibly a mistake or placeholder from another part of the script) is specified using the linspace function. This creates an array of evenly spaced values over the given interval.\n\n4. **Plotting Data**: The data points are generated by evaluating G(s) at each value in the 's' array. These points are then plotted against their corresponding real parts (since 's' is complex, it has both a real and imaginary part).\n\n5. **Customization**: The appearance of the plot can be customized with various commands such as title(), xlabel(), ylabel(), grid(), etc., which add labels, a grid to the background, and more.\n\n6. **Displaying Plot**: Finally, the figure command is used to display the generated plot.\n\nIn summary, this script generates a complex number plot where each point represents a value of G(s) for different values of 's'. The resulting graph visualizes how the function changes across its domain, offering insights into its behavior and characteristics.  \n\nThe image presents a Nyquist plot of a function G(s) = 20(s^2 + s + 0.5)/[(s+1)(s+10)], which is a graphical representation used to analyze the stability and behavior of control systems. The plot displays the frequency response of the system, with the real axis representing the magnitude of the transfer function and the imaginary axis representing its phase.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Magnitude:** The magnitude of the transfer function is plotted on the real axis, ranging from -3 to 3.\n*   **Phase:** The phase of the transfer function is plotted on the imaginary axis, also ranging from -5 to 1.\n*   **Frequency Response:** The plot shows a clear frequency response curve, with the system's magnitude and phase varying as the frequency increases or decreases.\n*   **Stability Analysis:** The Nyquist plot can be used to determine the stability of the system. If the closed-loop transfer function encircles the point (-1, j0) in a counterclockwise direction, the system is unstable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Nyquist plot provides valuable insights into the behavior and stability of control systems. By analyzing the frequency response curve, designers can optimize their systems to achieve desired performance characteristics while ensuring stability. This tool is an essential component of modern control engineering practice. 7–128 Nyquist plot for the positive-frequency region.  \n\nA–7–13.

MATLAB Program 7–20 produces the Nyquist plot, as shown in Figure 7–130.  \n\nThis system is unstable, because the $-1+j0$ point is encircled once clockwise. Note that this is a special case where the Nyquist plot passes through $-1+j0$ point and also encircles this point once clockwise.This means that the closed-loop system is degenerate; the system behaves as if it were an unstable first-order system.See the following closed-loop transfer function of the positivefeedback system:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,6}{s^{2}\\,+\\,5s\\,+\\,4\\,-\\,\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,6\\right)}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=\\frac{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,6}{s\\,-\\,2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet for generating a plot of the function G(s) = -(s^2 + 4s + 6) using MATLAB.

By using the Nyquist plot, we can determine whether a system is stable or unstable and evaluate its performance characteristics.\n\n*Answer*: The image presents a Nyquist plot, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a control system. It consists of three main components: the origin, the unit circle, and the Nichols chart. The plot is used to analyze the stability and performance of control systems by examining the location of the closed-loop poles and zeros with respect to the unit circle and evaluating the magnitude and phase angle of the system's transfer function. 7–131 Nyquist plots for positive-feedback system and negativefeedback system.  \n\nA–7–15. Consider the control system shown in Figure 7–60. (Refer to Example 7–19.) Using the inverse polar plot, determine the range of gain $K$ for stability.  \n\nSolution. Since  \n\n$$\nG_{2}(s)\\,=\\,{\\frac{1}{s^{3}\\,+\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,G_{1}(s)G_{2}(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,0.5)}{s^{3}\\,+\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nHence, the inverse of the feedforward transfer function is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{G(s)}}={\\frac{s^{3}\\,+\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,1}{K(s\\,+\\,0.5)}}\n$$  \n\nNotice that $1/G(s)$ has a pole at $s\\,=\\,-0.5$ . It does not have any pole in the right-half $s$ plane. Therefore, the Nyquist stability equation  \n\n$$\nZ=N+P\n$$  \n\nreduces to $Z\\,=\\,N$ since $P\\,=\\,0.$ . The reduced equation states that the number $Z$ of the zeros of   \n$1\\,+\\,\\left[1/G(s)\\right]$ in the right-half $s$ lane is equal to $N$ umber of clockwise encirclements of   \nthe –1+j0 point. For stability, Nmust be equal to zero, or there should be no encirclement. Fig  \nure 7–132 shows the Nyquist plot or polar plot of $K/G(j\\omega)$ .Notice that since  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\frac{K}{G(j\\omega)}=\\Bigg[\\frac{(j\\omega)^{3}\\:+\\:(j\\omega)^{2}\\:+\\:1}{j\\omega\\:+\\:0.5}\\Bigg]\\Big(\\frac{0.5\\:-\\:j\\omega}{0.5\\:-\\:j\\omega}\\Big)}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=\\frac{0.5\\:-\\:0.5\\omega^{2}\\:-\\:\\omega^{4}\\:+\\:j\\omega(-1\\:+\\:0.5\\omega^{2})}{0.25\\:+\\:\\omega^{2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–132 Polar plot of $K/G(j\\omega)$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a complex plane diagram, featuring two loci: the **K/G Locus** and the **K/G Plane**. The K/G Locus is represented by a curved line that begins at the origin (0, 0) and extends outward in a counterclockwise direction. It passes through various points on the complex plane, including the real axis at x = 1 and y = -2, as well as several other points with non-zero imaginary components.\n\nThe K/G Plane is depicted by a circular arc that originates from the origin (0, 0) and extends outward in a counterclockwise direction. This locus also intersects the real axis at multiple points, including x = 1 and y = -2, among others.\n\nBoth loci are labeled with mathematical expressions and Greek letters, which suggest that they may be related to some kind of mathematical function or equation. The use of these symbols indicates that the diagram is likely used for educational or illustrative purposes, perhaps in a textbook or lecture notes on advanced mathematics.\n\nOverall, the image provides a visual representation of two complex loci, which can help students and mathematicians understand their properties and relationships.  \n\nthe $K/G(j\\omega)$ locus crosses the negative real axis at $\\omega=\\sqrt{2}$ ,and the crossing point at the negative real axis is $^{-2}$ .  \n\nFrom Figure 7–132, we see that if the critical point lies in the region between $^{-2}$ and $-\\infty$ , then the critical point is not encircled. Hence, for stability, we require  \n\n$$\n-1<\\frac{-2}{K}\n$$  \n\nThus, the range of gain $K$ for stability is  \n\n$$\n2<K\n$$  \n\nwhich is the same result as we obtained in Example 7–19.  \n\n# A–7–16.  \n\nFigure 7–133 shows a block diagram of a space-vehicle control system. Determine the gain $K$ such that the phase margin is $50^{\\circ}$ .What is the gain margin in this case?  \n\nSolution. Since  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{K(j\\omega+2)}{(j\\omega)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n\\big/G(j\\omega)=\\,\\big/j\\omega\\,+\\,2\\,-\\,2\\,\\big/j\\omega=\\,\\tan^{-1}\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\,-\\,180^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nThe requirement that the phase margin be $50^{\\circ}$ means that $\\big/G\\big(j\\omega_{c}\\big)$ must be equal to $-130^{\\circ}$ , where $\\omega_{c}$ is the gain crossover frequency, or  \n\n$$\n\\big/G\\big(j\\omega_{c}\\big)=-130^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nFigure 7–133   \nSpace-vehicle control system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising several components that are interconnected to form a closed-loop configuration.

The controller adjusts the system's response to its input signal based on the plant's output, while the feedback loop ensures that the system converges to a stable equilibrium state.  \n\nHence, we set  \n\n$$\n\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{2}}=50^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nfrom which we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{c}\\,=\\,2.3835\\,\\mathrm{rad/sec}\n$$  \n\nSince the phase curve never crosses the $-180^{\\circ}$ line, the gain margin is $+\\infty$ dB.

The graph is divided into four quadrants by two axes: the x-axis (ω) and the y-axis (dB). \n\n*   The x-axis represents angular frequency, ω, ranging from 0 to 100 rad/sec.\n*   The y-axis represents decibel values, dB, ranging from -80 to 40 dB.\n\n**Curve 1:**\n\n*   This curve is a smooth, continuous function that decreases as the angular frequency increases.\n*   It starts at approximately 20 dB and ends at around -60 dB.\n*   The curve has several local maxima and minima, indicating changes in its slope or rate of decrease.\n\n**Curve 2:**\n\n*   This curve is also a smooth, continuous function that decreases as the angular frequency increases.\n*   It starts at approximately -20 dB and ends at around -80 dB.\n*   The curve has fewer local maxima and minima compared to Curve 1, suggesting a more gradual decrease.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   Both curves exhibit negative slopes, indicating that they both decrease as the angular frequency increases.\n*   The curves intersect the x-axis multiple times, indicating points where their values are zero.\n*   There are no visible asymptotes or discontinuities in either curve.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph displays two functions with distinct characteristics. Curve 1 shows a more rapid decrease than Curve 2, while both curves exhibit negative slopes and intersect the x-axis at multiple points. 7–135 Bode diagram of the open-loop transfer function of a unityfeedback control system.  \n\nNoting that there is another corner frequency at $\\omega=0.5$ rad 'sec and the slope of the magnitude curve in the low-frequency region is $-40$ dB 'decade, $G(j\\omega)$ can be tentatively determined as follows:  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)=\\frac{K\\Big(\\frac{j\\omega}{0.5}+1\\Big)}{(j\\omega)^{2}\\Bigg[\\left(\\frac{j\\omega}{2}\\right)^{2}+0.1(j\\omega)\\,+\\,1\\Bigg]}\n$$  \n\nSince, from Figure 7 we find $\\left|G(j0.1)\\right|=40\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ ,he gain value $K$ can be determined to be unity.Also, the calculated phase curve, $\\underline{{\\langle G(j\\omega)\\rangle}}$ versus v, agrees with the given phase curve.

A closed-loop control system may include an unstable element within the loop.When the Nyquist stability criterion is to be applied to such a system, the frequency-response curves for the unstable element must be obtained.  \n\nHow can we obtain experimentally the frequency-response curves for such an unstable element? Suggest a possible approach to the experimental determination of the frequency response of an unstable linear element.  \n\nSolution. One possible approach is to measure the frequency-response characteristics of the unstable element by using it as a part of a stable system.  \n\nFigure 7–136 Control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a system, comprising various components and signals. Here is a detailed breakdown of the elements present:\n\n*   **Input Signal (r)**\n    *   The input signal to the system is represented by the symbol \"r\".\n    *   It is shown entering the system from the left side.\n*   **Multiplier**\n    *   A multiplier is used to scale the input signal by a factor of 2.\n    *   This operation is indicated by an arrow pointing towards the right, with the label \"x\" next to it.\n*   **Adder**\n    *   An adder combines the scaled input signal with another signal from the system.\n    *   The adder is denoted by a box with two inputs and one output.\n*   **System Components (G1(s) and G2(s))**\n    *   The system consists of two components, represented as blocks labeled \"G1(s)\" and \"G2(s)\".\n    *   These components are likely filters or transfer functions that process the input signal.\n*   **Output Signal (e)**\n    *   The output signal from the system is denoted by the symbol \"e\".\n    *   It exits the system on the right side.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a simple feedback control system where an input signal is scaled and combined with another signal before being processed through two system components. The resulting output signal is then shown exiting the system.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 7–136. Suppose that the element $G_{1}(s)$ is unstable.The complete system may be made stable by choosing a suitable linear element $G_{2}(s)$ .We apply a sinusoidal signal at the input.At steady state, all signals in the loop will be sinusoidal.We measure the signals $e(t)$ , the input to the unstable element, and $x(t)$ , the output of the unstable element. By changing the frequency [and possibly the amplitude for the convenience of measuring $e(t)$ and $x(t)]$ of the input sinusoid and repeating this process, it is possible to obtain the frequency response of the unstable linear element.  \n\nA–7–20. Show that the lead network and lag network inserted in cascade in an open loop act as proportional-plus-derivative control (in the region of small $\\omega$ ) and proportional-plus-integral control (in the region of large $\\omega$ ), respectively.  \n\nSolution. In the region of small $\\omega$ , the polar plot of the lead network is approximately the same as that of the proportional-plus-derivative controller.This is shown in Figure 7–137(a).  \n\nSimilarly, in the region of large $\\omega$ , the polar plot of the lag network approximates the proportional-plus-integral controller, as shown in Figure 7–137(b).  \n\nA–7–21. Consider a lag–lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ defined by  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=K_{c}\\frac{\\biggl(s+\\frac{1}{T_{1}}\\biggr)\\biggl(s+\\frac{1}{T_{2}}\\biggr)}{\\biggl(s+\\frac{\\beta}{T_{1}}\\biggr)\\biggl(s+\\frac{1}{\\beta T_{2}}\\biggr)}\n$$  \n\nShow that at frequency $\\omega_{1}$ ,where  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{1}={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T_{1}T_{2}}}}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents two diagrams, labeled (a) and (b), which appear to illustrate various control systems. The diagrams are accompanied by labels that suggest they represent different types of controllers or systems.\n\n*   **Diagram (a)**:\n    *   This diagram features a semicircle with its center at the origin (0, 0).\n    *   The semicircle is divided into two regions: one above the x-axis and another below it.\n    *   The region above the x-axis contains several labels, including \"PD controller,\" \"Lead network,\" \"ω = 0,\" and \"α.\" These labels seem to indicate that this region represents a specific type of controller or system, possibly related to proportional-derivative (PD) control or lead networks.\n    *   In contrast, the region below the x-axis contains only one label: \"Im.\" This could represent the imaginary axis in complex analysis or another aspect of the controller/system being described.\n*   **Diagram (b)**:\n    *   Similar to Diagram (a), this diagram also features a semicircle with its center at the origin (0, 0).\n    *   However, unlike Diagram (a), the labels on this semicircle are placed along both the x-axis and the imaginary axis.\n    *   Along the x-axis, we find \"1/β,\" which might represent a gain or scaling factor in the controller/system. On the other side of the origin, there is no label directly opposite it.\n    *   The region above the x-axis contains labels such as \"ω = 0\" and \"α,\" similar to those found in Diagram (a). These could be related to specific settings or parameters within the controller or system being described.\n\nIn summary, while both diagrams share similarities with each other, they do present some differences. The placement of labels on the semicircles differs between them, suggesting that they might represent distinct aspects or components within a broader control system architecture. However, without additional context or information about what these symbols and regions signify, it's challenging to provide a definitive explanation for their meaning. 7–137 (a) Polar plots of a lead network and a proportional-plusderivative controller; (b) polar plots of a lag network and a proportional-plusintegral controller.  \n\nthe phase angle of $G_{c}(j\\omega)$ becomes zero.

The diagram consists of several blocks that represent different components of the system.\n\n*   **Input Block:**\n    *   The input block represents the input signal to the system.\n    *   It is labeled as \"K\" and has an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   There are no other labels or descriptions on this block.\n*   **Gain Block:**\n    *   The gain block represents a constant multiplier in the system.\n    *   It is labeled as \"K + 0.1s + 0.5\" and has an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   This block takes into account the time variable (s) and adds a constant term to the input signal.\n*   **Summation Block:**\n    *   The summation block represents the sum of two signals in the system.\n    *   It is labeled as \"10/s(s + 1)\" and has an arrow pointing towards it.\n    *   This block takes into account both the time variable (s) and adds a constant term to the signal.\n*   **Output Block:**\n    *   The output block represents the output signal of the system.\n    *   It is labeled as \"/s(s + 1)\" and has an arrow pointing away from it.\n    *   This block takes into account both the time variable (s) and adds a constant term to the signal.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a block diagram of a control system that consists of three main blocks: input, gain, and summation. The input block represents the input signal, while the gain block applies a constant multiplier to the input signal. The summation block combines two signals, one from the gain block and another from an unknown source, resulting in the output signal. Overall, the diagram provides a visual representation of how the different components of the control system interact with each other.  \n\nLet us plot the Bode diagram of $G(s)$ when $K=1,$ . MATLAB Program 7–22 may be used for this purpose. Figure 7–139 shows the Bode diagram produced by this program. From this diagram the required phase margin of $60^{\\circ}$ occurs at the frequency $\\omega=1.15$ rad 'sec.The magnitude of $G(j\\omega)$ at this frequency is found to be 14.5 dB.Then gain $K$ must satisfy the following equation:  \n\n$$\n20\\log K=-14.5\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK=0.188\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation, specifically a Bode Diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the magnitude plot and the phase plot.\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot**\n    *   The magnitude plot shows the gain of the system in decibels (dB) as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency, ranging from 0 to 10^3 rad/s.\n    *   The y-axis represents the gain in dB, ranging from -20 to 20 dB.\n    *   There are two lines on the magnitude plot: one for the numerator and one for the denominator of the transfer function.\n    *   The line for the numerator is a horizontal line at 0 dB, indicating that the numerator does not contribute to the gain.\n    *   The line for the denominator is a curve that decreases in amplitude as frequency increases, indicating that the denominator contributes to the attenuation of the signal.\n*   **Phase Plot**\n    *   The phase plot shows the phase shift of the system in degrees as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency, ranging from 0 to 10^3 rad/s.\n    *   The y-axis represents the phase shift in degrees, ranging from -180° to 180°.\n    *   There are two lines on the phase plot: one for the numerator and one for the denominator of the transfer function.\n    *   The line for the numerator is a horizontal line at 0°, indicating that the numerator does not contribute to the phase shift.\n    *   The line for the denominator is a curve that increases in amplitude as frequency increases, indicating that the denominator contributes to the phase shift.\n\nOverall, the Bode Diagram shows how the gain and phase of the system change with frequency. The magnitude plot indicates that the system has a high-pass filter characteristic, while the phase plot indicates that the system introduces some delay at low frequencies.  \n\nThus, we have determined the value of gain $K$ . Since the angle curve does not cross the $-180^{\\circ}$ line, the gain margin is $+\\infty$ dB.  \n\nTo verify the results, let us draw a Nyquist plot of $G$ for the frequency range  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{W}=0.5;0.01;1.15\n$$  \n\nThe end point of the locus $(\\omega=1.15\\,\\mathrm{rad/sec})$ )will be on a unit circle in the Nyquist plane.To check the phase margin, it is convenient to draw the Nyquist plot on a polar diagram, using polar grids. To draw the Nyquist plot on a polar diagram, first define a complex vector $z$ by  \n\n$$\nz={\\mathsf{r e}}+{\\mathsf{i}}{\\mathsf{i}}{\\mathsf{m}}={\\mathsf{r e}}^{\\mathsf{i}\\theta}\n$$  \n\nwhere rand $\\theta$ (theta) are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\Gamma=\\mathsf{a b s}(z)}}\\\\ {{\\mathsf{t h e t a}=\\mathsf{a n g l e}(z)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe abs means the square root of the sum of the real part squared and imaginary part squared;   \nangle means tan –1 (imaginary part/real part).  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: an amplitude plot and a phase plot.\n\n*   **Amplitude Plot**\n    *   The amplitude plot shows the magnitude of the system's transfer function in decibels (dB) versus frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second (rad/s), ranging from 10^-3 to 10^1.\n    *   The y-axis represents the magnitude in dB, ranging from -200 to 100.\n    *   The plot shows a downward trend as the frequency increases, indicating that the system's gain decreases with increasing frequency.\n*   **Phase Plot**\n    *   The phase plot shows the phase angle of the system's transfer function in degrees versus frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second (rad/s), ranging from 10^-3 to 10^1.\n    *   The y-axis represents the phase angle in degrees, ranging from -180 to 180.\n    *   The plot shows a non-linear trend, with the phase angle increasing and then decreasing as the frequency increases.\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response of the system, showing how the magnitude and phase angle change with respect to frequency. The amplitude plot indicates that the system's gain decreases with increasing frequency, while the phase plot shows a non-linear trend in the phase angle. 7–139 Bode diagram of $G(s)=\\frac{10s\\,+\\,1}{s(s\\,+\\,0.5)(s\\,+\\,1)}.$  \n\nIf we use the command polar(theta,r)  \n\nMATLAB will produce a plot in the polar coordinates. Subsequent use of the grid command draws polar grid lines and grid circles.  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–23 produces the Nyquist plot of $G(j\\omega)$ , where $\\omega$ is between 0.5 and 1.15 rad 'sec.The resulting plot is shown in Figure 7–140.Notice that point $G(j1.15)$ lies on the unit circle, and the phase angle of this point is $-120^{\\circ}$ . Hence, the phase margin is $60^{\\circ}$ . The fact that point $G(j1.15)$ is on the unit circle verifies that at $\\omega=1.15$ rad 'sec the magnitude is equal to 1 or 0 dB. (Thus, $\\omega=1.15$ is the gain crossover frequency.) Thus, $K=0.188$ gives the desired phase margin of $60^{\\circ}$ .  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for creating a Nyquist plot, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The program includes several lines of code that define variables and functions used to generate the plot.\n\n*   **Title**: The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 7-23,\" indicating that it is part of a larger collection of programs or exercises.\n    *   This suggests that the program is intended for educational purposes, possibly as an assignment or example in a course on signal processing or control systems.\n*   **Comments**: The program includes several comments throughout the code, which provide explanations and notes about what each section does.\n    *   These comments help to clarify the purpose of different parts of the code and make it easier for others to understand how the program works.\n*   **Variables and functions**: The program defines several variables and functions, including `num`, `den`, `w`, `r`, `theta`, `z`, `abs`, and `phase`.\n    *   These variables and functions are likely used to manipulate and analyze data related to the system being modeled.\n*   **Plot generation**: The program includes code that generates a Nyquist plot, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of the system.\n    *   This suggests that the program is intended for visualization purposes, allowing users to see how different parameters affect the behavior of the system.\n\nOverall, the program appears to be a tool for analyzing and visualizing the frequency response of a system. It includes several features that make it useful for educational or research purposes, such as its ability to generate plots and provide detailed explanations through comments.  \n\nThe image depicts a Nyquist plot, which is a graphical representation used to analyze the stability and behavior of control systems. The plot is a polar coordinate system with a unit circle at its center.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Unit Circle:** The central circle represents the unit circle, which serves as a reference for analyzing the frequency response of a system.\n*   **Nyquist Plot:** The larger circular region surrounding the unit circle contains the Nyquist plot itself. This is where the magnitude and phase angle of the system's transfer function are plotted against each other in a two-dimensional plane.\n*   **Phase Angle:** The phase angle is represented by the angular coordinate on the polar axis, measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis.\n*   **Magnitude:** The magnitude is represented by the radial distance from the origin to a point on the plot, with higher magnitudes indicating greater amplitude at that frequency.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe Nyquist plot provides valuable insights into the stability and performance of control systems. It can be used to:\n\n*   Determine the stability of the system\n*   Analyze the frequency response and gain margin\n*   Identify potential issues such as poles or zeros in the right half-plane\n\nBy examining the Nyquist plot, engineers can optimize their designs to achieve desired stability characteristics and performance metrics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image presents a comprehensive view of a Nyquist plot, highlighting its key components and providing insights into the analysis of control systems. By understanding how to interpret this graphical representation, engineers can effectively design and evaluate control systems for optimal performance and stability. 7–140 Nyquist plot of $G(j\\omega)$ showing that the phase margin is $60^{\\circ}$  \n\nNote that in writing ‘text’ in the polar diagram we enter the text command as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname{text}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y},^{\\prime}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^{\\prime})\n$$  \n\nFor example, to write ‘Nyquist plot’ starting at point $(0.3,-1.7)$ , enter the command  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{text}(0.3,-1.7,\"\\mathrm{Nyquist}\\;\\mathrm{plot}^{\\prime})\n$$  \n\nThe text is written horizontally on the screen.  \n\nA–7–23. If the open-loop transfer function $G(s)$ involves lightly damped complex-conjugant poles, then more than one $M$ locus may be tangent to the $G(j\\omega)$ locus.

Figure 7–141 shows the Bode diagram of $G(j\\omega)$ . Figure 7–142 shows the log-magnitude-versus-phase plot of $G(j\\omega)$ . It is seen that the $G(j\\omega)$ locus is tangent to the $M=8$ -dB locus at $\\omega=0.97$ rad 'sec, and it is tangent to the $M=-4$ -dB locus at $\\omega=2.8$ rad 'sec.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two lines, each representing a different function. The graph is divided into three sections: frequency, amplitude, and phase.\n\n*   **Frequency Section**\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency, ranging from 0.1 rad/sec to 10 rad/sec.\n    *   The y-axis represents the input or output of the system being analyzed.\n*   **Amplitude Section**\n    *   The graph shows two lines, one solid and one dashed, representing different functions.\n    *   The solid line starts at approximately -20 dB and increases to around 0 dB as frequency approaches 1 rad/sec.\n    *   The dashed line begins at about -10 dB and rises to roughly 5 dB near 2 rad/sec.\n*   **Phase Section**\n    *   The graph displays a range of values from -360° to 40° on the y-axis.\n    *   The solid line exhibits a gradual decrease in phase as frequency increases, starting at approximately -180° and ending around -20°.\n    *   In contrast, the dashed line shows a more rapid decline in phase, beginning at about -90° and dropping to roughly -30°.\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates two distinct functions, each with its own characteristics in terms of amplitude and phase response across varying frequencies. 7–141 Bode diagram of $G(s)$ given by Equation (7–32).  \n\nThe image presents a graph with multiple lines and curves, accompanied by various labels and markings.

Further information or context would be necessary to fully understand the significance of the various lines, curves, labels, and annotations present in the graph. 7–142 Log-magnitudeversus-phase plot of $G(s)$ given by Equation (7–32).  \n\nFigure 7–143 shows the Bode diagram of the closed-loop transfer function. The magnitude curve of the closed-loop frequency response shows two resonant peaks. Note that such a case occurs when the closed-loop transfer function involves the product of two lightly damped secondorder terms and the two corresponding resonant frequencies are sufficiently separated from each other.As a matter of fact, the closed-loop transfer function of this system can be written  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)}}\\ ~~}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle~~~~~~~=\\frac{9}{\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,0.487s\\,+\\,1\\right)\\!\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,0.613s\\,+\\,9\\right)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThis image presents a comprehensive frequency response plot, comprising multiple graphs that provide detailed information about the system's behavior.\n\nThe top graph displays the decibel (dB) values on the y-axis and frequency measured in radians per second (rad/s) on the x-axis. The curve peaks at around 1 rad/s, reaching an amplitude of approximately -20 dB, indicating a significant decrease in signal strength. This data suggests that the system exhibits a relatively high-pass filter behavior.\n\nThe lower graph shows phase values in degrees along the y-axis and frequency measured in radians per second (rad/s) on the x-axis. The curve remains flat at 0° until around 1 rad/s, where it begins to increase, eventually reaching an amplitude of approximately -180° at higher frequencies. This data implies that the system's phase response is generally low-pass in nature.\n\nThe grid lines are spaced one decade apart on both axes, providing a clear and easily readable visual representation of the frequency response data. Overall, this plot effectively conveys the characteristics of the system being analyzed, enabling users to quickly identify key features such as resonance frequencies, passband, stopband, and phase shift. 7–143 Bode diagram of $G(s)/[1{\\overline{{+}}}\\ G(s)]$ ,where $G(s)$ is given by Equation (7–32).  \n\nClearly, the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function is a product of two lightly damped second-order terms (the damping ratios are 0.243 and 0.102), and the two resonant frequencies are sufficiently separated.  \n\nA–7–24. Consider the system shown in Figure 7–144(a). Design a compensator such that the closed-loop system will satisfy the requirements that the static velocity error constant $=20\\ {\\mathrm{sec}}^{-1}$ ,phase margin $=50^{\\circ}$ , and gain margin $\\geq10$ dB.  \n\nSolution. To satisfy the requirements, we shall try a lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ of the form  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{c}\\alpha\\,\\displaystyle\\frac{T s\\,+\\,1}{\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{{\\,=\\,K_{c}\\displaystyle\\frac{s\\,+\\,\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{T}}{s+\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n(If the lead compensator does not work, then we need to employ a compensator of different form.) The compensated system is shown in Figure 7–144(b).  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)=K G(s)=\\frac{10K}{s(s^{\\mathrm{~+~}1})}\n$$  \n\nwhere $K\\,=\\,K_{c}\\alpha.$ . The first step in the design is to adjust the gain $K$ to meet the steady-state performance specification or to provide the required static velocity error constant. Since the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is given as $20\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , we have  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{K_{v}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)}\\\\ &{\\qquad=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s\\frac{T s+1}{\\alpha T s+1}G_{1}(s)}\\\\ &{\\qquad=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{s10K}{s(s+1)}}}\\\\ &{\\qquad=10K=20}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\nWith $K=2$ ,the compensated system will satisfy the steady-state requirement. We shall next plot the Bode diagram of  \n\n$$\nG_{1}(s)=\\frac{20}{s(s+1)}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating two distinct systems, labeled \"a\" and \"b\", each comprising multiple components. The chart is designed to convey information about the relationships between these components.\n\n*   **System A**\n    *   **Input**: The system receives an input from the left side.\n    *   **Processing Block 1 (G(s))**: This block processes the input, represented by the symbol G(s).\n    *   **Summing Junction**: The processed signal is then summed with another signal at this junction.\n    *   **Output**: The final output of the system is generated on the right side.\n*   **System B**\n    *   **Input**: Similar to System A, System B also receives an input from the left side.\n    *   **Processing Block 2 (Gc(s))**: This block processes the input, represented by the symbol Gc(s).\n    *   **Summing Junction**: The processed signal is then summed with another signal at this junction.\n    *   **Output**: The final output of System B is generated on the right side.\n\nIn summary, the image effectively illustrates the composition and operation of two separate systems. By examining the flowchart, one can understand how each system processes its input and generates an output based on the interactions between various components. 7–144 (a) Control system; (b) compensated system.  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–24 produces the Bode diagram shown in Figure 7–145. From this plot, the phase margin is found to be $14^{\\circ}$ .The gain margin is $+\\infty$ dB.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for creating a Bode diagram. \n\n*   The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 7-24\".\n*   The program starts with the line `num = [20];`, which defines a vector containing the numerator coefficients of the transfer function.\n*   The next line, `den = [1 1 0];`, defines a vector containing the denominator coefficients of the transfer function.\n*   The line `w = logspace(-1,2,100);` generates an array of frequencies from -10 to 10 Hz with 100 points in between.\n*   The line `bode(num,den,w)` plots the magnitude and phase response of the system at each frequency in the array `w`.\n*   Finally, the program includes a comment that says \"Bode Diagram of G1(s) = 20/[s(s+1)]\".\n\nOverall, this program is used to create a Bode diagram for a simple first-order transfer function.  \n\nSince the specification calls for a phase margin of $50^{\\circ}$ , the additional phase lead necessary to satisfy the phase-margin requirement is $36^{\\circ}$ .A lead compensator can contribute this amount.  \n\nNoting that the addition of a lead compensator modifies the magnitude curve in the Bode diagram, we realize that the gain crossover frequency will be shifted to the right.We must offset the increased phase lag of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ due to this increase in the gain crossover frequency.Taking the shift of the gain crossover frequency into consideration, we may assume that $\\phi_{m}$ ,the maximum phase lead required, is approximately $41^{\\circ}$ . (This means that approximately $5^{\\circ}$ has been added to compensate for the shift in the gain crossover frequency.) Since  \n\n$$\n\\sin\\phi_{m}=\\frac{1-\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}\n$$  \n\n$\\phi_{m}=41^{\\circ}$ corresponds to $\\alpha\\,=\\,0.2077$ .Note that $\\alpha=0.21$ corresponds to $\\phi_{m}=40.76^{\\circ}$ . Whether we choose $\\phi_{m}=41^{\\circ}$ or $\\phi_{m}=40.76^{\\circ}$ does not make much difference in the final solution. Hence, let us choose $\\alpha=0.21$ .  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section displays the magnitude response, and the bottom section shows the phase response.\n\n**Top Section (Magnitude Response)**\n\n*   The x-axis represents frequency in radians per second (rad/s), ranging from 10^-1 to 10^2.\n*   The y-axis represents the magnitude of the system's response in decibels (dB).\n*   A straight line with a slope of -20 dB/decade is plotted, indicating that the system has a single pole at the origin.\n\n**Bottom Section (Phase Response)**\n\n*   The x-axis represents frequency in radians per second (rad/s), ranging from 10^-1 to 10^2.\n*   The y-axis represents the phase angle of the system's response in degrees.\n*   A straight line with a slope of -45°/decade is plotted, indicating that the system has a single pole at the origin.\n\n**Overall**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response of the system, showing how the magnitude and phase of the output change as the input frequency varies. The diagram suggests that the system has a low-pass characteristic, with the magnitude decreasing as the frequency increases beyond 1 rad/s. The phase response also indicates a lag in the output relative to the input, which can be useful for designing control systems or filters. 7–145 Bode diagram of $G_{1}(s)$ .  \n\nOnce the attenuation factor $\\alpha$ has been determined on the basis of the required phase-lead 1 angle, the next step is to determine the corner frequencies $\\omega=1/T$ and $\\omega=1/(\\alpha T)$ of the lead compensator. Notice that the maximum phase-lead angle $\\phi_{m}$ occurs at the geometric mean of the two corner frequencies, or $\\omega\\,=\\,1/\\big(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T\\big)$ .  \n\nThe amount of the modification in the magnitude curve at $\\omega\\,=\\,1/\\big(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T\\big)$ due to the inclusion of the term $(T s\\,+\\,1)/(\\alpha T s\\,+\\,1)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\Bigg|}{\\frac{1\\,+\\,j\\omega T}{1\\,+\\,j\\omega\\alpha T}}{\\Bigg|}_{\\omega={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}T}}}=\\left|{\\frac{1\\,+\\,j{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}}}{1\\,+\\,j\\alpha{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}}}}\\right|={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}}\n$$  \n\nNote that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.21}}=6.7778\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$  \n\nWe need to find the frequency point where, when the lead compensator is added, the total magnitude becomes 0 dB.  \n\nFrom Figure 7–145 we see that the frequency point where the magnitude of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ is $-6.7778$ dB occurs between $\\omega=1$ and 10 rad 'sec. Hence, we plot a new Bode diagram of $G_{1}(j\\omega)$ in the frequency range between $\\omega=1$ and 10 to locate the exact point where $G_{1}(j\\omega)\\,=\\,-6.7778$ dB. MATLAB Program 7–25 produces the Bode diagram in this frequency range, which is shown in Figure 7–146. From this diagram, we find the frequency point where $\\left|G_{1}(j\\omega)\\right|\\,=-6.7778$ dB occurs at $\\omega\\,=\\,6.5686$ rad 'sec. Let us select this frequency to be the new gain crossover frequency, or $\\omega_{c}\\,=\\,6.5686$ rad 'sec. Noting that this frequency corresponds to $\\bar{1}/(\\sqrt{\\alpha}T)$ ,or  \n\n$$\n\\omega_{c}={\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}T}}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{T}}=\\omega_{c}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}=6.5686{\\sqrt{0.21}}=3.0101\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha T}=\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}=\\frac{6.5686}{\\sqrt{0.21}}=14.3339\n$$  \n\nThe image displays a code snippet in a programming language, specifically MATLAB. The code is written in a clear and readable format.\n\n*   The code starts with `MATLAB Program 7-25` which indicates that this is a specific program within a larger collection of programs.\n*   Below the title, there are several lines of code that define variables and functions. The first line defines a variable named `num` with an initial value of 20. This suggests that the program will be working with numerical values.\n*   The second line defines another variable called `den` with an initial value of 1, 1, and 0. This indicates that the program will also work with fractions or rational numbers.\n*   The third line starts a function definition using the keyword `w = logspace(0,1,100)`. This suggests that the program will be generating a sequence of logarithmically spaced values between 0 and 10^1 (or 10).\n*   The fourth line defines a variable called `bode` as an empty array. This indicates that the program will be storing data in this array.\n*   The fifth line calls a function named `title('Bode Diagram of G1(s) = 20/[s(s+1)]')`. This suggests that the program will generate a Bode diagram for a transfer function with a numerator of 20 and a denominator of s^2 + s.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be setting up a MATLAB script to generate a Bode diagram for a specific transfer function. The script defines variables, generates logarithmically spaced values, and calls a function to create the Bode diagram.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two plots, each featuring a diagonal line that starts at the top left and extends to the bottom right.

The code is structured into three main sections: defining the system model, generating the Bode plot, and adding annotations.\n\n* **Defining the System Model**\n\t+ The code begins by defining the system model using the `numc` and `denc` functions.\n\t+ The numerator of the transfer function is represented as [9.5238 28.6676].\n\t+ The denominator of the transfer function is represented as [1 14.3339].\n* **Generating the Bode Plot**\n\t+ The code then uses the `bode` function to generate a Bode plot for the specified system.\n\t+ The resulting plot displays the magnitude and phase response of the system in decibels (dB) versus frequency on a logarithmic scale.\n* **Adding Annotations**\n\t+ Finally, the code adds annotations to the plot using the `Logarithm` function from the `Mathematica` package.\n\t+ The annotation includes the text \"Bode Diagram of Gc(s)\" and is displayed at the top-left corner of the plot.\n\nIn summary, the Mathematica code generates a Bode plot for a transfer function with a numerator of [9.5238 28.6676] and a denominator of [1 14.3339]. The resulting plot displays the magnitude and phase response of the system in decibels (dB) versus frequency on a logarithmic scale, accompanied by an annotation indicating that it represents the Bode diagram of Gc(s).  \n\nThe image presents two frequency response plots, each with a distinct shape and characteristics. The top plot features a Bode magnitude plot, which displays the magnitude of the system's transfer function as a function of frequency. The bottom plot shows a phase angle plot, which represents the phase shift introduced by the system at different frequencies.\n\n**Top Plot: Bode Magnitude Plot**\n\n*   **Shape:** The plot exhibits an increasing trend from low to high frequencies, indicating that the magnitude of the system's transfer function increases with frequency.\n*   **Characteristics:** The plot has a single peak in the middle frequency range, suggesting a resonance or a region of maximum gain.\n*   **Frequency Range:** The x-axis spans from 10^-1 rad/sec to 10^3 rad/sec, covering a wide range of frequencies.\n\n**Bottom Plot: Phase Angle Plot**\n\n*   **Shape:** The plot displays a sinusoidal shape with increasing amplitude as the frequency increases, indicating that the phase shift introduced by the system becomes more pronounced at higher frequencies.\n*   **Characteristics:** The plot has a single trough in the middle frequency range, suggesting a region of minimum phase lag or maximum phase lead.\n*   **Frequency Range:** The x-axis spans from 10^-1 rad/sec to 10^3 rad/sec, covering the same frequency range as the top plot.\n\n**Comparison and Observations**\n\n*   Both plots exhibit similar frequency ranges and shapes, but with opposite trends. While the magnitude plot increases with frequency, the phase angle plot decreases with frequency.\n*   The peak in the magnitude plot corresponds to a trough in the phase angle plot, suggesting a trade-off between magnitude and phase response.\n*   The plots suggest that the system has a resonant or oscillatory behavior at certain frequencies, which may be desirable or undesirable depending on the application.\n\nIn summary, the image presents two frequency response plots that provide insights into the magnitude and phase characteristics of a system. While the magnitude plot increases with frequency, the phase angle plot decreases with frequency, suggesting a trade-off between these two responses. The plots also reveal a resonant behavior at certain frequencies, which may be relevant for understanding the system's dynamics or performance.  \n\nFigure 7–147 Bode diagram of $G_{c}(s)$ .  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the designed system is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{G_{c}(s)G(s)\\space=\\space9.5238\\frac{s\\space+\\space3.0101}{s\\space+\\space14.3339}\\frac{10}{s\\space(s\\space+\\space1)}}&{}&\\\\ {\\space=\\space\\frac{95.238s\\space+\\space286.6759}{s^{3}\\space+\\space15.3339s^{2}\\space+\\space14.3339s}}&{}&\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–27 will produce the Bode diagram of $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ , which is shown in Figure 7–148.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program, specifically designed to create a Bode diagram. The program is titled \"MATLAB Program 7-27\" and consists of several lines of code that define various parameters and functions.\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 7-27\".\n*   **Code**\n    *   The code is written in MATLAB syntax.\n    *   It defines two variables: `num` and `den`, which represent the numerator and denominator of a transfer function, respectively.\n    *   The transfer function is defined as `[95.238 286.6759]` for the numerator and `[1 15.3339 14.3339 0]` for the denominator.\n    *   The code also defines a variable `w`, which represents an array of frequencies, ranging from `-1` to `3,100`.\n    *   A function called `bode` is used to generate the Bode diagram.\n*   **Output**\n    *   The output of the program is a Bode diagram, which displays the magnitude and phase response of the system at different frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a MATLAB program that generates a Bode diagram for a given transfer function. The program defines the transfer function, specifies an array of frequencies, and uses the `bode` function to generate the diagram.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a line that slopes downward from left to right. The top section is labeled \"Phase (deg) Magnitude (dB)\" and displays a range of values on both axes. Conversely, the bottom section is labeled \"Frequency (rad/sec)\" and also exhibits a range of values along its axes.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Sloping Lines:** Both sections feature lines that slope downward from left to right.\n*   **Labeled Axes:** The top section has labeled axes for phase in degrees and magnitude in decibels, while the bottom section has labeled axes for frequency in radians per second.\n*   **Range of Values:** Each section displays a range of values along its axes, providing context for the data being presented.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image appears to be a graph illustrating the relationship between phase and magnitude or frequency. The sloping lines suggest a negative correlation between these variables, with larger values on one axis corresponding to smaller values on the other. The labeled axes provide clarity regarding the units of measurement used in each section. Overall, the image presents a clear and concise visual representation of complex data. 7–148 Bode diagram of $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ .  \n\nFrom MATLAB Program 7–27 and Figure 7–148 it is clearly seen that the phase margin is approximately $50^{\\circ}$ and the gain margin is $+\\infty$ dB. Since the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is $20\\ \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , all the specifications are met. Before we conclude this problem, we need to check the transient-response characteristics.  \n\nUnit-Step Response: We shall compare the unit-step response of the compensated system with that of the original uncompensated system.  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function of the original uncompensated system is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{10}{s^{2}\\,+\\,s\\,+\\,10}}\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{95.238s\\,+\\,286.6759}{s^{3}\\,+\\,15.3339s^{2}\\,+\\,110.5719s\\,+\\,286.6759}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–28 produces the unit-step responses of the uncompensated and compensated systems. The resulting response curves are shown in Figure 7–149. Clearly, the compensated system exhibits a satisfactory response. Note that the closed-loop zero and poles are located as follows:  \n\n$s\\,=\\,-5.2880\\,\\pm\\,j5.6824,\\;\\;\\;s\\,=\\,-4.7579$  \n\nUnit-Ramp Response: It is worthwhile to check the unit-ramp response of the compensated system. Since $K_{v}\\,=\\,20\\,\\ \\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , the steady-state error following the unit-ramp input will be $1/K_{v}=0.05$ . The static velocity error constant of the uncompensated system is $10\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ . Hence, the original uncompensated system will have twice as large a steady-state error in following the unit-ramp input.  \n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a MATLAB program, which is a high-level programming language primarily used for numerical computation and data analysis.

By comparing the uncompensated and compensated systems, it becomes clear that compensation can significantly enhance the performance of a system by reducing its settling time and improving its stability. 7–149 Unit-step responses of the uncompensated and compensated systems.  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–29 produces the unit-ramp response curves. [Note that the unit-ramp response is obtained as the unit-step response of $C(s)/s R(s).]$ The resulting curves are shown in Figure 7–150.The compensated system has a steady-state error equal to one-half that of the original uncompensated system.  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet for a MATLAB program, specifically designed to visualize and analyze unit-ramp responses of uncompensated and compensated systems.

By analyzing these responses, engineers can gain insights into the performance characteristics of their control systems and optimize them accordingly.  \n\nThe image presents a graph comparing the unit-ramp responses of two systems: an uncompensated system and a compensated system.

Since the gain $K$ of the plant is adjustable, let us assume that $K_{c}=1.$ . Then $\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,1.$ From the requirement on the static velocity error constant, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K_{v}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\,\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)\\,\\displaystyle\\frac{K}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)}}}\\\\ {{~~~}}\\\\ {{{}=\\displaystyle\\frac{K}{4}=10}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\nK=40\n$$  \n\nWe shall first plot a Bode diagram of the uncompensated system with $K=40.$ MATLAB Program 7–30 may be used to plot this Bode diagram.The diagram obtained is shown in Figure 7–151.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB code snippet, with a title at the top that reads \"MATLAB Program 7-30.\" The code is written in black text and is presented on a white background.\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 7-30.\"\n    *   It suggests that this program is part of a larger collection of MATLAB programs.\n*   **Code**\n    *   The code snippet is written in MATLAB's syntax and includes several lines of code.\n    *   The first line defines a variable `num` with the value `[40]`.\n    *   The second line defines another variable `den` with the value `[15 4 0]`.\n    *   The third line uses the `logspace` function to generate an array of logarithmically spaced values between `-1` and `100`.\n    *   The fourth line plots a Bode diagram using the `bode` function.\n*   **Bode Diagram**\n    *   A Bode diagram is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system.\n    *   In this case, the Bode diagram shows the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the logarithmic scale of frequencies, while the y-axis represents the magnitude and phase of the transfer function.\n\nOverall, the image presents a simple MATLAB program that generates a Bode diagram for a given system. The code is well-organized and easy to read, making it accessible to users with basic knowledge of MATLAB programming.  \n\nThe image shows a Bode diagram, which is used to analyze and visualize the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two graphs: one for the magnitude response (top) and one for the phase response (bottom).\n\n**Magnitude Response Graph**\n\n*   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second.\n*   The y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function in decibels (dB).\n*   The graph shows a downward slope, indicating that the magnitude of the transfer function decreases as the frequency increases.\n*   There is a sharp drop in magnitude at around 10 rad/s, indicating a pole or zero in the system.\n\n**Phase Response Graph**\n\n*   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second.\n*   The y-axis represents the phase angle in degrees.\n*   The graph shows a linear increase in phase angle as the frequency increases, indicating that the system introduces some delay at higher frequencies.\n*   There is a sharp change in phase angle at around 10 rad/s, indicating a pole or zero in the system.\n\n**Overall**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides valuable information about the frequency response of the system. The magnitude response graph shows that the system has a low-pass filter characteristic, with a significant attenuation of high-frequency signals. The phase response graph indicates that the system introduces some delay at higher frequencies. Overall, the Bode diagram suggests that the system is suitable for applications where a moderate amount of filtering and delay are required.  \n\nFigure 7–151   \nBode diagram of   \n$G(s)\\,=\\,\\bar{40}/\\bigl[s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)\\bigr]$ .  \n\nFrom Figure 7–151, the phase margin of the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is found to be $-16^{\\circ}$ , which indicates that this system is unstable. The next step in the design of a lag–lead compensator is to choose a new gain crossover frequency. From the phase-angle curve for $G(j\\omega)$ , we notice that the phase crossover frequency is $\\omega=2$ rad 'sec. We may choose the new gain crossover frequency to be 2 rad 'sec so that the phase-lead angle required at $\\omega=2$ rad 'sec is about $50^{\\circ}$ . A single lag–lead compensator can provide this amount of phaselead angle quite easily.  \n\nOnce we choose the gain crossover frequency to be 2 rad 'sec, we can determine the corner frequencies of the phase-lag portion of the lag–lead compensator. Let us choose the corner frequency $\\omega=1/T_{2}$ (which corresponds to the zero of the phase-lag portion of the compensator) to be 1 decade below the new gain crossover frequency, or at $\\omega=0.2$ rad 'sec. For another corner frequency $\\omega\\,=\\,1/(\\beta T_{2})$ ,we need the value of $_{\\beta}$ . The value of $\\beta$ can be determined from the consideration of the lead portion of the compensator, as shown next.  \n\nFor the lead compensator, the maximum phase-lead angle $\\phi_{m}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\sin\\phi_{m}=\\frac{\\beta-1}{\\beta+1}\n$$  \n\nNotice that $\\beta=10$ corresponds to $\\phi_{m}=54.9^{\\circ}$ . Since we need a $50^{\\circ}$ phase margin, we may choose $\\beta=10.$ . (Note that we will be using several degrees less than the maximum angle, $54.9^{\\circ}$ .) Thus,  \n\n$$\n\\beta=10\n$$  \n\nThen the corner frequency $\\omega\\,=\\,1/(\\beta T_{2})$ (which corresponds to the pole of the phase-lag portion of the compensator) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\omega=0.02\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function of the phase-lag portion of the lag–lead compensator becomes  \n\n$$\n\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.2}{s\\,+\\,0.02}=10\\bigg(\\frac{5s\\,+\\,1}{50s\\,+\\,1}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nThe phase-lead portion can be determined as follows: Since the new gain crossover frequency is $\\omega=2$ rad 'sec om Fi –151, $\\left|G(j2)\\right|$ is found to be 6 d nce, if the lag–lead compensator contributes $^{-6}$ dB at $\\omega=2$ rad 'sec,then the new gain crossover frequency is as desired.From this requirement, it is possible to draw a straight line of slope 20 dB/decade passing through the point (2 rad 'sec, $-6$ dB ). (Such a line has been manually drawn on Figure 7–151.) The intersections of this line and the 0-dB line and $-20$ -dB line determine the corner frequencies. From this consideration, the corner frequencies for the lead portion can be determined as $\\omega=0.4$ rad 'sec and $\\omega=4$ rad 'sec. Thus, the transfer function of the lead portion of the lag–lead compensator becomes  \n\n$$\n\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.4}{s\\,+\\,4}=\\frac{1}{10}\\left(\\frac{2.5s\\,+\\,1}{0.25s\\,+\\,1}\\right)\n$$  \n\nCombining the transfer functions of the lag and lead portions of the compensator, we can obtain the transfer function $G_{c}(s)$ of the lag–lead compensator. Since we chose $K_{c}=1$ , we have  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.4}{s\\,+\\,4}\\frac{s\\,+\\,0.2}{s\\,+\\,0.02}=\\frac{(2.5s\\,+\\,1)(5s\\,+\\,1)}{(0.25s\\,+\\,1)(50s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThe Bode diagram of the lag–lead compensator $G_{c}(s)$ can be obtained by entering MATLAB Program 7–31 into the computer.The resulting plot is shown in Figure 7–152.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, specifically focusing on the Lag-Lead compensator. The title \"Bode Diagram of Lag-Lead Compensator\" is displayed at the top.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Graphs:** There are two graphs shown side by side.\n    *   The top graph shows the magnitude response (in dB) as a function of frequency (in rad/s).\n    *   The bottom graph displays the phase response (in degrees) as a function of frequency (in rad/s).\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   The x-axis represents frequency in radians per second.\n    *   The y-axis on the left represents magnitude in decibels, while the y-axis on the right represents phase in degrees.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   The graphs illustrate the frequency response of the Lag-Lead compensator.\n*   The magnitude response shows a peak at around 1 rad/s, indicating resonance.\n*   The phase response exhibits a linear increase with frequency, followed by a sharp drop-off beyond 10 rad/s.\n*   The diagrams are presented in black and white, with no additional colors or labels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides valuable insights into the frequency response characteristics of the Lag-Lead compensator. By analyzing these graphs, one can understand how the system responds to different frequencies and identify potential resonance peaks or phase shifts. 7–152 Bode diagram of the designed lag–lead compensator.  \n\nThe image displays a MATLAB program for creating a Bode diagram of a lag-lead compensator. The code is written in black text on a white background.\n\n*   The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 7-31\".\n*   The first line of code defines two variables: `numc` and `denc`, which represent the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function, respectively.\n*   The second line of code plots the Bode diagram using the `bode()` function with the specified title and labels.\n*   The third line of code displays the legend for the plot.\n\nOverall, this program generates a Bode diagram that shows the frequency response of a lag-lead compensator.  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function of the compensated system is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{G_{c}(s)G(s)=\\displaystyle\\frac{(s\\,+\\,0.4)(s\\,+\\,0.2)}{(s\\,+\\,4)(s\\,+\\,0.02)}\\displaystyle\\frac{40}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{40s^{2}\\,+\\,24s\\,+\\,3.2}{s^{5}\\,+\\,9.02s^{4}\\,+\\,24.18s^{3}\\,+\\,16.48s^{2}\\,+\\,0.32s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing MATLAB Program 7–32 the magnitude and phase-angle curves of the designed open-loop transfer function $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ can be obtained as shown in Figure 7–153. Note that the denominator polynomial den1 was obtained using the conv command, as follows:  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical expression, specifically a matrix multiplication problem. The top row of matrices is labeled \"a\" and consists of two 2x1 vectors with elements [1 4.02] and [0.08], respectively. Below it lies another matrix labeled \"b\", also comprising two 2x1 vectors with elements [15 40].\n\nThe question asks for the result of multiplying these matrices together. To do this, we perform standard matrix multiplication rules.\n\nFirstly, we multiply each row of the first matrix by each column of the second and sum up the products:\n\n*   For the top-left element: (1 * 15) + (4.02 * 0) = 15\n*   For the top-right element: (1 * 40) + (4.02 * 15) = 100 + 60.3 = 160.3\n\nNext, we repeat this process for the second row of matrix \"a\":\n\n*   For the bottom-left element: (0.08 * 15) + (4.02 * 40) = 1.2 + 161.6 = 162.8\n*   For the bottom-right element: (0.08 * 40) + (4.02 * 15) = 3.2 + 60.3 = 63.5\n\nThus, the resulting matrix after multiplication is:\n\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} 15 & 160.3 \\\\ 162.8 & 63.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nThis matrix represents the product of matrices \"a\" and \"b\".  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram is divided into two sections: top and bottom.\n\n**Top Section: Magnitude Response**\n\n* The x-axis represents the logarithmic frequency scale (in radians per second).\n* The y-axis represents the magnitude response in decibels (dB).\n* A single curve plots the magnitude response, which starts at approximately -50 dB at low frequencies and decreases to around -200 dB as the frequency increases.\n* The curve exhibits a gentle slope at lower frequencies before becoming more steeply negative at higher frequencies.\n\n**Bottom Section: Phase Response**\n\n* The x-axis represents the logarithmic frequency scale (in radians per second).\n* The y-axis represents the phase response in degrees.\n* A single curve plots the phase response, which starts at approximately -300° at low frequencies and increases to around 0° as the frequency approaches unity.\n* The curve exhibits a gentle slope at lower frequencies before becoming more flatly positive at higher frequencies.\n\n**Overall**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides a comprehensive view of the system's frequency response, allowing for analysis of both magnitude and phase characteristics across various frequencies. 7–153 Bode diagram of the open-loop transfer function $G_{c}(s)G(s)$ of the compensated system.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program, specifically designed to generate a bode diagram. The code is written in black text on a white background and consists of two lines:\n\n*   `num1 = [40 24 3.2];`\n*   `den1 = [19.02 24.18 16.48 0.32 0];`\n\nThe program defines two vectors, num1 and den1, which represent the numerator and denominator polynomials of a transfer function in the frequency domain. The values within these vectors correspond to the coefficients of each polynomial term.\n\nTo create a bode diagram using this code, one would typically call upon MATLAB's built-in functions for handling signal processing and control systems. These functions enable the visualization of the system's behavior across various frequencies, providing valuable insights into its stability and performance characteristics.\n\nOverall, the provided code serves as a foundation for analyzing dynamic systems through numerical computations and graphical representations in MATLAB.  \n\nSince the phase margin of the compensated system is $50^{\\circ}$ , the gain margin is $12\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ , and the static velocity error constant is $10\\;\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , all the requirements are met.  \n\nWe shall next investigate the transient-response characteristics of the designed system.  \n\nUnit-Step Response: Noting that  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\frac{40(s\\,+\\,0.4)(s\\,+\\,0.2)}{(s\\,+\\,4)(s\\,+\\,0.02)s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{c}(s)G(s)}{1+G_{c}(s)G(s)}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\qquad=\\frac{40(s+0.4)(s+0.2)}{(s+4)(s+0.02)s(s+1)(s+4)+40(s+0.4)(s+0.2)}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTo determine the denominator polynomial with MATLAB, we may proceed as follows: Define  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{a(s)\\,=\\,(s\\,+\\,4)(s\\,+\\,0.02)\\,=\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,4.02s\\,+\\,0.08}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{b(s)\\,=\\,s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)\\,=\\,s^{3}\\,+\\,5s^{2}\\,+\\,4s}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{c(s)\\,=\\,40(s\\,+\\,0.4)(s\\,+\\,0.2)\\,=\\,40s^{2}\\,+\\,24s\\,+\\,3.2}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\sf a}=[1\\ \\ 4.02\\ \\ 0.08]}\\\\ {{\\sf b}=[1\\ \\ 5\\ \\ 4\\ \\ 0]}\\\\ {{\\sf c}=[40\\ \\ 24\\ \\ 3.2]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing the following MATLAB program, we obtain the denominator polynomial.  \n\nThe image shows a mathematical equation with variables and constants, but it does not provide any visual content. Therefore, there is nothing to describe visually in this case.\n\n*Answer*: There is no answer to this question as it pertains to an image rather than a text-based query.  \n\nMATLAB Program 7–33 is used to obtain the unit-step response of the compensated system. The resulting unit-step response curve is shown in Figure 7–154. (Note that the gain-adjusted but uncompensated system is unstable.)  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB code snippet for performing unit-step response compensation. \n\n*   The code is written in black text on a white background.\n*   It includes several lines of code, including:\n    *   `num = [40 24 3.2];` which defines the numerator coefficients of the transfer function.\n    *   `den = [1 9.02 24.18 56.48 24.32 3.2];` which defines the denominator coefficients of the transfer function.\n    *   `t = 0:0.2:40;` which generates an array of time points from 0 to 40 with a step size of 0.2 seconds.\n    *   `step(num,den,t)` which computes and plots the unit-step response of the system.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to simulate and visualize the behavior of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system in response to a unit step input.  \n\nThe image presents a graph titled \"Unit-Step Response of Compensated System,\" which illustrates the response of a compensated system to a unit step input. The graph features two axes:\n\n*   **Amplitude (y-axis):** Ranging from 0 to 1.2, measured in units not specified.\n*   **Time (s) (x-axis):** Spanning from 0 to 40 seconds.\n\nThe graph displays a single curve that initially drops below the x-axis before rising sharply and eventually stabilizing at approximately 1. The curve's shape suggests that the system exhibits oscillatory behavior, with the amplitude of these oscillations decreasing over time.\n\nThe graph does not provide any additional information or context beyond its title and axes labels. It appears to be a simple plot intended for educational or illustrative purposes rather than presenting specific data or results from an experiment or simulation. 7–154 Unit-step response curve of the compensated system.  \n\nUnit-Ramp Response: The unit-ramp response of the compensated system may be obtained by entering MATLAB Program 7–34 into the computer. Here we converted the unit-ramp response of $G_{c}G/(1\\,+\\,G_{c}G)$ into the unit-step response of $G_{c}G/[s(1\\,+\\,G_{c}G)]$ . The unit-ramp response curve obtained using this program is shown in Figure 7–155.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB code snippet for generating a unit-ramp response, specifically designed to produce a ramp signal with a given input and output. The title of the program is \"Unit-Ramp Response\".\n\n*   **Title**: \n    *   \"MATLAB Program 7-34\"\n*   **Code**:\n    *   The code defines a function `num` that takes an array of numbers as input.\n    *   It then calculates the output using the formula: `out = (1/0.05)*input`\n    *   The result is plotted on a graph, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing the amplitude of the signal.\n\n**Answer**: This code generates a unit-ramp response, which is a type of signal that increases linearly over time.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with the title \"Unit-Ramp Response of Compensated System\" at the top. The x-axis is labeled as \"Time (sec)\" and spans from 0 to 20 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled as \"Unit-Ramp Input and Output (c(t))\" and ranges from 0 to 20.\n\n**Graph Description:**\n\n*   The graph features two lines: a solid black line representing the unit-ramp input and an offset line indicating the output response.\n*   Both lines exhibit identical behavior, with the output lagging behind the input by approximately 2 units in magnitude at all times between 0 and 20 seconds.\n*   The lines are nearly parallel to each other throughout this time interval, suggesting a stable system response.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Stable System Response:** The graph indicates that the compensated system exhibits a stable response to unit-ramp inputs, with minimal lag or oscillation between the input and output signals.\n*   **Output Lag:** The observed lag of approximately 2 units in magnitude suggests that there may be some delay or attenuation in the system's response, potentially due to inherent dynamics or compensation mechanisms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, the graph displays a stable unit-ramp response for the compensated system, with minimal oscillation and a consistent output lag of about 2 units behind the input signal. This suggests that the system is well-behaved and effectively compensates for any underlying dynamics or disturbances. 7–155 Unit-ramp response of the compensated system.  \n\n# PROBLEMS  \n\nB–7–1.

For example, we presented electronic, hydraulic, and pneumatic PID controllers. We also designed control systems where PID controllers were involved.  \n\nIt is interesting to note that more than half of the industrial controllers in use today are PID controllers or modified PID controllers.  \n\nBecause most PID controllers are adjusted on-site, many different types of tuning rules have been proposed in the literature.Using these tuning rules,delicate and fine tuning of PID controllers can be made on-site.Also, automatic tuning methods have been developed and some of the PID controllers may possess on-line automatic tuning capabilities. Modified forms of PID control, such as I-PD control and multi-degrees-offreedom PID control, are currently in use in industry. Many practical methods for bumpless switching (from manual operation to automatic operation) and gain scheduling are commercially available.  \n\nThe usefulness of PID controls lies in their general applicability to most control systems. In particular, when the mathematical model of the plant is not known and therefore analytical design methods cannot be used, PID controls prove to be most useful. In the field of process control systems,it is well known that the basic and modified PID control schemes have proved their usefulness in providing satisfactory control, although in many given situations they may not provide optimal control.  \n\nIn this chapter we first present the design of a PID controlled system using Ziegler and Nichols tuning rules.We next discuss a design of PID controller with the conventional frequency-response approach, followed by the computational optimization approach to design PID controllers. Then we introduce modified PID controls such as PI-D control and I-PD control.Then we introduce multi-degrees-of-freedom control systems,which can satisfy conflicting requirements that single-degree-of-freedom control systems cannot. (For the definition of multi-degrees-of-freedom control systems, see Section 8–6.)  \n\nIn practical cases, there may be one requirement on the response to disturbance input and another requirement on the response to reference input. Often these two requirements conflict with each other and cannot be satisfied in the single-degree-offreedom case. By increasing the degrees of freedom, we are able to satisfy both. In this chapter we present two-degrees-of-freedom control systems in detail.  \n\nThe computational optimization approach presented in this chapter to design control systems (such as to search optimal sets of parameter values to satisfy given transient response specifications) can be used to design both single-degree-of-freedom control systems and multi-degrees-of-freedom control systems, provided a fairly precice mathematical model of the plant is known.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. Section 8–1 has presented introductory material for the chapter. Section 8–2 deals with a design of a PID controller with Ziegler–Nichols Rules. Section 8–3 treats a design of a PID controller with the frequency-response approach. Section 8–4 presents a computational optimization approach to obtain optimal parameter values of PID controllers. Section 8–5 discusses multi-degrees-of-freedom control systems including modified PID control systems.  \n\n# 8–2 ZIEGLER–NICHOLS RULES FOR TUNINGPID CONTROLLERS  \n\nPID Control of Plants. Figure 8–1 shows a PID control of a plant. If a mathematical model of the plant can be derived, then it is possible to apply various design techniques for determining parameters of the controller that will meet the transient and steady-state specifications of the closed-loop system. However, if the plant is so complicated that its mathematical model cannot be easily obtained, then an analytical or computational approach to the design of a PID controller is not possible.Then we must resort to experimental approaches to the tuning of PID controllers.  \n\nThe process of selecting the controller parameters to meet given performance specifications is known as controller tuning. Ziegler and Nichols suggested rules for tuning PID controllers (meaning to set values $K_{p}$ ,$T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d.}$ ) based on experimental step responses or based on the value of $K_{p}$ that results in marginal stability when only proportional control action is used. Ziegler–Nichols rules, which are briefly presented in the following, are useful when mathematical models of plants are not known. (These rules can, of course, be applied to the design of systems with known mathematical models.) Such rules suggest a set of values of $K_{p},T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ that will give a stable operation of the system. However, the resulting system may exhibit a large maximum overshoot in the step response, which is unacceptable. In such a case we need series of fine tunings until an acceptable result is obtained. In fact, the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules give an educated guess for the parameter values and provide a starting point for fine tuning, rather than giving the final settings for $K_{p},T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ in a single shot.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a common representation used in engineering and mathematics to model and analyze complex systems.\n\n*   The diagram consists of several blocks connected by arrows, each representing a different component or process within the system.\n    *   The blocks are labeled with mathematical equations or symbols that describe the behavior of each component.\n        *   For example, one block is labeled as \"Kp(1 + 1/Tis)\", which represents a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller.\n            *   Another block is labeled simply as \"Plant\", indicating that it represents the physical system being controlled.\n                *   There are also blocks labeled with mathematical symbols such as \"+\" and \"-\".\n\nThe diagram shows how the different components interact with each other to produce the overall behavior of the system. The arrows connecting the blocks indicate the direction of information flow between them, which can be either forward or backward.\n\nOverall, the image provides a visual representation of the complex relationships between various components in a control system, allowing engineers and mathematicians to analyze and optimize its performance. 8–1 PID control of a plant.  \n\nZiegler–Nichols Rules for Tuning PID Controllers. Ziegler and Nichols proposed rules for determining values of the proportional gain $K_{p}$ ,integral time $T_{i}$ ,and derivative time $T_{d}$ based on the transient response characteristics of a given plant. Such determination of the parameters of PID controllers or tuning of PID controllers can be made by engineers on-site by experiments on the plant. (Numerous tuning rules for PID controllers have been proposed since the Ziegler–Nichols proposal.They are available in the literature and from the manufacturers of such controllers.)  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is used to model and analyze the behavior of complex systems. The diagram consists of several blocks and arrows that represent different components and signals within the system.\n\n*   **Plant Block**\n    *   The plant block represents the physical system being controlled.\n    *   It is typically represented by a transfer function or an equation that describes its dynamics.\n    *   In this case, the plant block is labeled as \"Plant\" and has an input u(t) and an output c(t).\n*   **Input Signal**\n    *   The input signal u(t) represents the control input to the system.\n    *   It is typically a function of time that describes the desired behavior of the system.\n    *   In this case, the input signal is labeled as \"u(t)\" and has an arrow pointing into the plant block.\n*   **Output Signal**\n    *   The output signal c(t) represents the response of the system to the input signal u(t).\n    *   It is typically a function of time that describes the actual behavior of the system.\n    *   In this case, the output signal is labeled as \"c(t)\" and has an arrow pointing out of the plant block.\n*   **Block Diagram Structure**\n    *   The diagram shows a simple feedback loop structure, where the output signal c(t) is fed back into the input signal u(t).\n    *   This structure is commonly used in control systems to stabilize the system's behavior and achieve desired performance characteristics.\n\nOverall, the image provides a clear visual representation of a control system's block diagram, highlighting the key components and their relationships. 8–2 Unit-step response of a plant.  \n\nThere are two methods called Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules: the first method and the second method.We shall give a brief presentation of these two methods.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with a curve that exhibits a tangent line at an inflection point, accompanied by labels and annotations. The graph is set against a white background.\n\n*   **Tangent Line**\n    *   A thin black arrowhead points to the tangent line.\n    *   The label \"Tangent line at inflection point\" is written in small black text next to the arrowhead.\n    *   The tangent line intersects the curve at approximately 60% of its height on the y-axis.\n*   **Curve**\n    *   The curve begins at the origin (0, 0) and rises gradually, curving upward.\n    *   It reaches a peak before flattening out into a horizontal line.\n    *   The curve is depicted in black.\n*   **Labels and Annotations**\n    *   The x-axis label \"t\" is written in small black text below the graph.\n    *   The y-axis label \"c(t)\" is written in small black text to the left of the graph.\n    *   A vertical line labeled \"L\" intersects the curve at approximately 20% of its height on the y-axis.\n    *   A horizontal line labeled \"T\" intersects the curve at approximately 80% of its height on the y-axis.\n\nThe graph appears to illustrate a mathematical concept or function, possibly related to calculus or physics. The tangent line and inflection point suggest that the curve represents a continuous function with a non-zero derivative at those points. The labels and annotations provide additional context and information about the graph's components. 8–3 S-shaped response curve.  \n\nFirst Method. In the first method, we obtain experimentally the response of the plant to a unit-step input, as shown in Figure 8–2. If the plant involves neither integrator(s) nor dominant complex-conjugate poles, then such a unit-step response curve may look S-shaped, as shown in Figure 8–3. This method applies if the response to a step input exhibits an S-shaped curve. Such step-response curves may be generated experimentally or from a dynamic simulation of the plant.  \n\nThe S-shaped curve may be characterized by two constants, delay time $L$ and time constant $T$ .The delay time and time constant are determined by drawing a tangent line at the inflection point of the S-shaped curve and determining the intersections of the tangent line with the time axis and line $c(t)\\,=\\,K$ ,as shown in Figure 8–3. The transfer function $C(s)/U(s)$ may then be approximated by a first-order system with a transport lag as follows:  \n\nTable 8–1 Ziegler–Nichols Tuning Rule Based on Step Response of Plant (First Method)   \n\nThe image presents a table that appears to be related to control systems, specifically focusing on the types of controllers and their corresponding transfer functions. The table is divided into three columns and four rows.\n\n*   **Type of Controller**\n    *   P (Proportional controller)\n    *   PI (Proportional-Integral controller)\n    *   PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller)\n    *   Td (Derivative controller)\n*   **Kp**\n    *   Kp is the proportional gain of the controller.\n    *   It represents the amplification factor for the error signal in a closed-loop control system.\n    *   The values are:\n        *   P: T/L\n        *   PI: 0.9T/L\n        *   PID: 1.2T/L\n        *   Td: 0\n*   **Ti**\n    *   Ti is the integral time constant of the controller.\n    *   It determines how quickly the integral term responds to changes in the error signal.\n    *   The values are:\n        *   P: ∞\n        *   PI: L/0.3\n        *   PID: 2L\n        *   Td: Not applicable (since it's a derivative controller)\n*   **Td**\n    *   Td is the derivative time constant of the controller.\n    *   It influences how rapidly the derivative term reacts to changes in the error signal.\n    *   The value is:\n        *   P, PI, PID: 0\n        *   Td: L\n\nIn summary, the table provides a concise overview of different control strategies and their associated mathematical representations. Understanding these parameters can help engineers design more effective feedback loops within complex systems by tailoring controller responses to specific requirements based on system dynamics and desired performance criteria.  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{U(s)}={\\frac{K e^{-L s}}{T s\\,+\\,1}}\n$$  \n\nZiegler and Nichols suggested to set the values of $K_{p},T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ according to the formula shown in Table 8–1.  \n\nNotice that the PID controller tuned by the first method of Ziegler–Nichols rules gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)}}\\\\ {{\\qquad=\\,1.2\\,\\frac{T}{L}\\,\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{2L s}\\,+\\,0.5L s\\bigg)}}\\\\ {{\\qquad=\\,0.6T\\frac{\\displaystyle\\left(s+\\frac{1}{L}\\right)^{2}}{s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus, the PID controller has a pole at the origin and double zeros at $s=-1/L$ .  \n\nSecond Method. In the second method, we first set $T_{i}=\\infty$ and $T_{d}=0$ Using the proportional control action only (see Figure 8–4), increase $K_{p}$ from 0 to a critical value $K_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ at which the output first exhibits sustained oscillations. (If the output does not exhibit sustained oscillations for whatever value $K_{p}$ may take, then this method does not apply.) Thus, the critical gain $K_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ and the corresponding period $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ are experimentally determined (see Figure 8–5). Ziegler and Nichols suggested that we set the values of the parameters $K_{p},T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ according to the formula shown in Table 8–2.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, featuring various components and their interconnections. The diagram is set against a white background.\n\n*   **Block Diagram Components:**\n    *   **Plant:** A rectangular box labeled \"Plant\" represents the physical system being controlled.\n    *   **Controller (Kp):** A rectangular box with an arrow pointing to the plant, labeled \"Kp\", represents the controller that generates the control signal.\n    *   **Reference Input (r(t)):** An input labeled \"r(t)\" feeds into the controller, representing the desired output or setpoint of the system.\n    *   **Control Signal (u(t)):** The output of the controller is an arrow pointing to the plant, labeled \"u(t)\", which represents the control signal applied to the system.\n    *   **Output (c(t)):** An output labeled \"c(t)\" comes out of the plant, representing the actual output or response of the system.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe image illustrates a basic feedback control loop, where the controller adjusts the control signal based on the difference between the desired output and the actual output. The block diagram provides a clear visual representation of the relationships between the various components in the control system. 8–4 Closed-loop system with a proportional controller.   \nChapter 8 /PID Controllers and Modified PID Controllers  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a waveform. The top section is labeled \"c(t)\" and displays a waveform with a peak at approximately 0.5 units on the y-axis, corresponding to a time of around 1 unit on the x-axis. In contrast, the bottom section is labeled \"Pcr\" and shows a waveform with a peak at roughly 0.2 units on the y-axis, occurring at a time of about 3 units on the x-axis.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Waveforms:** Both sections exhibit waveforms with peaks at specific points.\n*   **Labels:** The top section is labeled \"c(t)\", while the bottom section is labeled \"Pcr\".\n*   **Axes:** The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents amplitude or another relevant quantity.\n*   **Units:** The units on both axes are not explicitly stated but appear to be dimensionless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image likely depicts a comparison between two different waveforms or signals, with the top section showing a waveform with a higher peak amplitude and the bottom section displaying a waveform with a lower peak amplitude. The labels \"c(t)\" and \"Pcr\" suggest that these waveforms may represent different aspects of a physical phenomenon or system being studied.\n\n**Answer:** The image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a waveform. The top section is labeled \"c(t)\", while the bottom section is labeled \"Pcr\". Both sections exhibit waveforms with peaks at specific points. 8–5 Sustained oscillation with period $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ .($\\boldsymbol{P}_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ is measured in sec.)  \n\nTable 8–2 Ziegler–Nichols Tuning Rule Based on Critical Gain $K_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ and Critical Period $P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ (Second Method)   \n\nThe image presents a table with four rows and three columns, titled \"Type of Controller\" in the first column. The purpose of this table is to compare different types of controllers.\n\n*   The first row lists the type of controller as \"P\", which stands for Proportional.\n    *   In the second column, it has a value of 0.5K_cr.\n    *   In the third column, it has a value of T_i, which is not defined in this context but could represent a time constant or a parameter specific to the P controller.\n*   The second row lists the type of controller as \"PI\", which stands for Proportional-Integral.\n    *   In the second column, it has a value of 0.45K_cr.\n    *   In the third column, it has a value of T_i / (1 + 1.2), indicating that this parameter is related to both the integral and proportional components of the PI controller.\n*   The third row lists the type of controller as \"PID\", which stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative.\n    *   In the second column, it has a value of 0.6K_cr.\n    *   In the third column, it has a value of T_i / (1 + 1.2), similar to the PI controller but with a different coefficient or parameter that affects its behavior.\n*   The fourth row lists the type of controller as \"Pd\", which could represent a proportional-derivative or another variant of controllers not explicitly mentioned in the context provided.\n    *   In the second column, it has a value of 0.\n    *   In the third column, it has a value of T_d, representing time derivative or a parameter specific to this type of controller.\n\nThe table suggests that each type of controller has its unique characteristics and parameters defined in terms of constants (K_cr) and time-related values (T_i or T_d). These constants and time-related values are crucial for understanding how each controller operates within control systems.  \n\nNotice that the PID controller tuned by the second method of Ziegler–Nichols rules gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{G_{c}(s)=\\displaystyle K_{p}\\bigg(1+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+T_{d}s\\bigg)}&{{}}\\\\ {\\,=\\,0.6K_{\\mathrm{cr}}\\bigg(1+\\frac{1}{0.5P_{\\mathrm{cr}}s}+0.125P_{\\mathrm{cr}}s\\bigg)}&{{}}\\\\ {\\,=\\,0.075K_{\\mathrm{cr}}P_{\\mathrm{cr}}\\frac{\\bigg(s+\\frac{4}{P_{\\mathrm{cr}}}\\bigg)^{2}}{s}}&{{}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus, the PID controller has a pole at the origin and double zeros at $s=-4/P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$  \n\nNote that if the system has a known mathematical model (such as the transfer function), then we can use the root-locus method to find the critical gain $K_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ and the frequency of the sustained oscillations $\\omega_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ , where $2\\pi/\\omega_{\\mathrm{cr}}=P_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ .These values can be found from the crossing points of the root-locus branches with the $j\\omega$ axis. (Obviously, if the root-locus branches do not cross the $j\\omega$ axis, this method does not apply.)  \n\nComments. Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules (and other tuning rules presented in the literature) have been widely used to tune PID controllers in process control systems where the plant dynamics are not precisely known. Over many years, such tuning rules proved to be very useful.Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules can,of course,be applied to plants whose dynamics are known. (If the plant dynamics are known, many analytical and graphical approaches to the design of PID controllers are available, in addition to Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules.)  \n\n# EXAMPLE 8–1  \n\nConsider the control system shown in Figure 8–6 in which a PID controller is used to control the system.The PID controller has the transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nAlthough many analytical methods are available for the design of a PID controller for the present system, let us apply a Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule for the determination of the values of parameters $K_{p}$ ,$T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ .Then obtain a unit-step response curve and check to see if the designed system exhibits approximately $25\\%$ maximum overshoot. If the maximum overshoot is excessive ($40\\%$ or more), make a fine tuning and reduce the amount of the maximum overshoot to approximately $25\\%$ or less.  \n\nSince the plant has an integrator, we use the second method of Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules. By setting $T_{i}=\\infty$ and $T_{d}=0$ we obtain the closed-loop transfer function as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{K_{p}}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,5)\\,+\\,K_{p}}\n$$  \n\nThe value of $K_{p}$ that makes the system marginally stable so that sustained oscillation occurs can be obtained by use of Routh’s stability criterion. Since the characteristic equation for the closed-loop system is  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,6s^{2}\\,+\\,5s\\,+\\,K_{p}=0\n$$  \n\nthe Routh array becomes as follows:  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and signals. The main elements are:\n\n* **PID Controller**\n\t+ A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is used to regulate the process.\n\t+ It has three gains: P for proportionality, I for integral action, and D for derivative action.\n* **Transfer Function**\n\t+ A transfer function represents the relationship between the input and output of a system.\n\t+ In this case, it is given by s^3 + 6s^2 + 30s + Kp.\n\t+ The parameter Kp affects the stability and performance of the closed-loop system.\n* **Input Signal**\n\t+ The input signal to the system is denoted as R(s).\n\t+ It represents the reference or setpoint that the controller aims to track.\n* **Output Signal**\n\t+ The output signal from the system is represented by C(s).\n\t+ It is the controlled variable that the PID controller regulates.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a basic control system with a PID controller and a transfer function. The goal of this system is to regulate the output signal C(s) based on the input signal R(s). By adjusting the gains P, I, and D, the controller can achieve desired performance characteristics such as stability, responsiveness, and accuracy.  \n\nFigure 8–6   \nPID-controlled system.  \n\nExamining the coefficients of the first column of the Routh table, we find that sustained oscillation will occur if $K_{p}\\,=\\,30.$ Thus, the critical gain $K_{\\mathrm{cr}}$ is  \n\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{cr}}\\,=\\,30\n$$  \n\nWith gain $K_{p}$ set equal to $K_{\\mathrm{cr}}\\,(=\\,30)$ ,the characteristic equation becomes  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,6s^{2}\\,+\\,5s\\,+\\,30\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nTo find the frequency of the sustained oscillation, we substitute $s=j\\omega$ into this characteristic equation as follows:  \n\n$$\n(j\\omega)^{3}\\,+\\,6(j\\omega)^{2}\\,+\\,5(j\\omega)\\,+\\,30\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n6(5\\,-\\,\\omega^{2})\\,+\\,j\\omega\\bigl(5\\,-\\,\\omega^{2}\\bigr)\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nfrom which we find the frequency of the sustained oscillation to be $\\omega^{2}=5$ or $\\omega={\\sqrt{5}}$ Hence, the period of sustained oscillation is  \n\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{cr}}=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{5}}=2.8099\n$$  \n\nReferring to Table 8–2, we determine $K_{p},T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{K_{p}=0.6K_{\\mathrm{cr}}=18}\\\\ &{~}\\\\ &{T_{i}=0.5P_{\\mathrm{cr}}=1.405}\\\\ &{~}\\\\ &{T_{d}=0.125P_{\\mathrm{cr}}=0.35124}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe transfer function of the PID controller is thus  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle{G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\qquad=\\,18\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{1.405s}\\,+\\,0.35124s\\bigg)}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{\\qquad=\\,\\frac{6.3223(s\\,+\\,1.4235)^{2}}{s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a different component of the system.\n\n*   **Input Signal**\n    *   The input signal to the system is represented by the variable R(s).\n    *   It is fed into the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.\n*   **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller**\n    *   The PID controller is represented by a block labeled \"6.3223(s + 1.4235)^2 / s\".\n    *   It takes the input signal R(s) and produces an output signal U(s).\n*   **Transfer Function**\n    *   The transfer function of the system is given by G(s) = (s^2 + 1.4235s + 6.3223) / (s + 5).\n    *   It represents the relationship between the input and output signals of the system.\n*   **Output Signal**\n    *   The output signal of the system is represented by C(s).\n    *   It is the result of applying the transfer function to the input signal R(s).\n\nIn summary, the block diagram shows a PID controller with a specific transfer function that processes an input signal and produces an output signal. The transfer function can be used to analyze the behavior of the system in terms of its frequency response, stability, and performance. 8–7 Block diagram of the system with PID controller designed by use of the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule (second method).  \n\nThe PID controller has a pole at the origin and double zero at $s\\,=\\,-1.4235$ .A block diagram of the control system with the designed PID controller is shown in Figure 8–7.  \n\nNext, let us examine the unit-step response of the system. The closed-loop transfer function $C(s)/R(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{6.3223s^{2}+18s\\,+\\,12.811}{s^{4}\\,+\\,6s^{3}+\\,11.3223s^{2}\\,+\\,18s\\,+\\,12.811}\n$$  \n\nThe unit-step response of this system can be obtained easily with MATLAB. See MATLAB Program 8–1. The resulting unit-step response curve is shown in Figure 8–8. The maximum overshoot in the unit-step response is approximately $62\\%$ .The amount of maximum overshoot is excessive. It can be reduced by fine tuning the controller parameters. Such fine tuning can be made on the computer. We find that by keeping $K_{p}\\,=\\,18$ and by moving the double zero of the PID controller to $s\\,=\\,-0.65\\cdot$ —that is, using the PID controller  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,18\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{3.077s}\\,+\\,0.7692s\\bigg)\\,=\\,13.846\\,\\frac{(s\\,+\\,0.65)^{2}}{s}\n$$  \n\nthe maximum overshoot in the unit-step response can be reduced to approximately $18\\%$ (see Figure 8–9). If the proportional gain $K_{p}$ is increased to 39.42, without changing the location of the double zero $s=-0.65)$ ,that is, using the PID controller  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=39.42\\bigg(1\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{3.077s}}\\,+\\,0.7692s\\bigg)\\,=\\,30.322\\,{\\frac{(s\\,+\\,0.65)^{2}}{s}}\n$$  \n\nThe image displays a MATLAB code snippet for generating a unit-step response signal.\n\n*   The title of the image is \"MATLAB Program 8-1\".\n    *   This suggests that the code is part of a larger program or tutorial related to digital signal processing.\n*   The code defines two vectors: `num` and `den`.\n    *   These vectors represent the numerator and denominator polynomials of a transfer function, respectively.\n    *   The values in these vectors correspond to coefficients of a polynomial equation that describes the system's behavior.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a simple MATLAB program designed to generate a unit-step response signal based on a given transfer function defined by its numerator and denominator polynomials.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the unit-step response of a system, with the x-axis representing time in seconds and the y-axis representing amplitude. The graph is titled \"Unit-Step Response\" at the top.\n\n*   **X-Axis:**\n    *   Time (sec)\n*   **Y-Axis:**\n    *   Amplitude\n*   **Graph Lines:**\n    *   A single black line represents the unit-step response curve.\n    *   The line starts at 0 on both axes and rises to approximately 1.6 by 2 seconds, then drops back down to around 1 after peaking again at about 4 seconds.\n\nThe graph's title suggests that it is showing how a system responds to a sudden change in input, which is represented by the unit step function. The amplitude of this response is plotted against time, allowing for an analysis of the system's behavior over different periods. 8–8 Unit-step response curve of PIDcontrolled system designed by use of the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule (second method).  \n\nThe image depicts a graph with a y-axis labeled \"Amplitude\" and an x-axis labeled \"Time (sec)\". The y-axis ranges from 0 to 1.2, while the x-axis spans from 0 to 7 seconds.\n\nA single curve is plotted on the graph, starting at approximately (0, 0) and rising sharply before leveling off around (4, 1). The curve then gradually descends back down towards the x-axis as it approaches the end of the time range. The overall trend of the curve is a bell-shaped pattern.\n\nThe graph lacks any additional features or details beyond the plotted curve and axis labels. 8–9 Unit-step response of the system shown in Figure 8–6 with PID controller having parameters $K_{p}\\,=\\,18$ ,$T_{i}=3.077$ ,and $T_{d}=0.7692$ .  \n\nthen the speed of response is increased, but the maximum overshoot is also increased to approximately $28\\%$ ,as shown in Figure 8–10.Since the maximum overshoot in this case is fairly close to $25\\%$ and the response is faster than the system with $G_{c}(s)$ given by Equation (8–1),we may consider $G_{c}(s)$ as given by Equation (8–2) as acceptable.Then the tuned values of $K_{p},T_{i}$ ,and $T_{d}$ become  \n\n$$\nK_{p}=39.42,\\qquad T_{i}=3.077,\\qquad T_{d}=0.7692\n$$  \n\nIt is interesting to observe that these values respectively are approximately twice the values suggested by the second method of the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule.The important thing to note here is that the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule has provided a starting point for fine tuning.  \n\nIt is instructive to note that, for the case where the double zero is located at $s=-1.4235$ ,increasing the value of $K_{p}$ increases the speed of response, but as far as the percentage maximum overshoot is concerned, varying gain $K_{p}$ has very little effect.The reason for this may be seen from  \n\nThe image presents a graph with the title \"Unit-Step Response\" at the top, accompanied by a y-axis labeled \"Amplitude\" and an x-axis labeled \"Time (sec)\".

Figure 8–11 shows the root-locus diagram for the system designed by use of the second method of Ziegler–Nichols tuning rules. Since the dominant branches of root loci are along the $\\zeta=0.3$ lines for a considerable range of $K$ ,varying the value of $K$ (from 6 to 30) will not change the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles very much. However, varying the location of the double zero has a significant effect on the maximum overshoot, because the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles can be changed significantly.This can also be seen from the root-locus analysis.Figure 8–12 shows the root-locus diagram for the system where the PID controller has the double zero at $s=-0.65.$ .Notice the change of the root-locus configuration.This change in the configuration makes it possible to change the damping ratio of the dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\nIn Figure 8–12, notice that, in the case where the system has gain $K=30.322$ ,the closed-loop poles at $s=-2.35\\pm j4.82$ act as dominant poles.Two additional closed-loop poles are very near the double zero at $s=-0.65$ ,with the result that these closed-loop poles and the double zero almost cancel each other.The dominant pair of closed-loop poles indeed determines the nature of the response. On the other hand, when the system has $K=13.846$ ,the closed-loop poles at $s=-2.35\\pm j2.62$ are not quite dominant because the two other closed-loop poles near the double zero at $s=-0.65$ have considerable effect on the response.The maximum overshoot in the step response in this case $(18\\%)$ is much larger than the case where the system is of second order and having only dominant closed-loop poles. (In the latter case the maximum overshoot in the step response would be approximately $6\\%$ .)  \n\nIt is possible to make a third, a fourth, and still further trials to obtain a better response. But this will take a lot of computations and time. If more trials are desired, it is desirable to use the computational approach presented in Section 10–3. Problem A–8–12 solves this problem with the computational approach with MATLAB. It finds sets of parameter values that will yield the maximum overshoot of $10\\%$ or less and the settling time of 3 sec or less.A solution to the present problem obtained in Problem A–8–12 is that for the PID controller defined by  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K\\,\\frac{(s\\,+\\,a)^{2}}{s}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical diagram, comprising various symbols and equations.

Obtain the unit-step and unit-ramp response curves of the PID controlled system with MATLAB.  \n\nLet us choose the PID controller to be  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{K(a s\\,+\\,1)(b s\\,+\\,1)}{s}\n$$  \n\nFigure 8–13 Control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between different components in the system. The diagram shows the flow of signals and variables through the system, including the input, processing, and output.\n\n*   **Input**\n    *   The input to the system is represented by an arrow pointing into the block labeled \"Gc(s)\".\n    *   This indicates that the input signal is fed into a controller or filter with transfer function Gc(s).\n*   **Processing**\n    *   The processing part of the system is represented by a block labeled \"Gc(s)\".\n    *   This block represents the controller or filter that processes the input signal and produces an output signal.\n    *   The transfer function of this block is denoted as Gc(s), which describes how the input signal is transformed into an output signal.\n*   **Output**\n    *   The output of the system is represented by an arrow pointing out of the block labeled \"1/s^2+1\".\n    *   This indicates that the processed signal from the controller or filter is fed into a second-order system with transfer function 1/s^2+1.\n*   **Second-Order System**\n    *   The second-order system is represented by a block labeled \"1/s^2+1\".\n    *   This block represents a dynamic system that responds to the input signal from the controller or filter.\n    *   The transfer function of this block describes how the input signal is transformed into an output signal in response to changes in the input.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a control system with two main components: a controller or filter represented by Gc(s), and a second-order dynamic system represented by 1/s^2+1. The input signal is fed into the controller or filter, which produces an output signal that is then fed into the second-order system. The output of the second-order system represents the final response to the input signal.  \n\nSince the static velocity error constant $K_{v}$ is specified as $4~\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{K_{v}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s G_{c}(s)\\,\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,1}=\\displaystyle\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s\\,\\frac{K(a s\\,+\\,1)(b s\\,+\\,1)}{s}\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,1}}}\\\\ {{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,=K\\,=\\,4}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{4(a s\\,+\\,1)(b s\\,+\\,1)}{s}\n$$  \n\nNext, we plot a Bode diagram of  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{4}{s(s^{2}\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 8–2 produces a Bode diagram of $G(s)$ .The resulting Bode diagram is shown in Figure 8–14.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical diagram, specifically a Bode Diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram displays the magnitude and phase angle of the system's transfer function as a function of frequency.\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   The title of the diagram is \"Bode Diagram\" in large font.\n*   **Axes**\n    *   The x-axis represents the logarithmic scale of frequency, ranging from 1 rad/s to 10^3 rad/s.\n    *   The y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function in decibels (dB).\n    *   There are two subplots: one for the magnitude and one for the phase angle.\n*   **Magnitude Plot**\n    *   The magnitude plot shows a smooth curve with a constant slope of -20 dB/decade at high frequencies.\n    *   At low frequencies, the magnitude plot has a flat region with a value of 0 dB.\n*   **Phase Angle Plot**\n    *   The phase angle plot shows a linear relationship between the frequency and phase angle, with a slope of -45°/decade.\n    *   The phase angle is zero at low frequencies and decreases to -90° at high frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the Bode Diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response of a system, allowing for easy identification of its characteristics such as gain, resonance, and stability.  \nBode Diagram of $4/[s(s^{2}+1)]$  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: one for magnitude and one for phase.\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot**\n    *   The magnitude plot shows the amplitude of the system's output signal as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second, ranging from 10^-1 to 10^1.\n    *   The y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function, measured in decibels (dB).\n    *   At low frequencies (around 0.1 rad/s), the magnitude is approximately -20 dB.\n    *   As the frequency increases, the magnitude decreases and reaches a minimum around 10 rad/s, with a value of approximately -40 dB.\n    *   Beyond this point, the magnitude starts to increase again, reaching a maximum at high frequencies (around 1000 rad/s), with a value of approximately 20 dB.\n*   **Phase Plot**\n    *   The phase plot shows the phase shift between the input and output signals as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second, ranging from 10^-1 to 10^1.\n    *   The y-axis represents the phase angle in degrees, ranging from -180° to 180°.\n    *   At low frequencies (around 0.1 rad/s), the phase is approximately -90°.\n    *   As the frequency increases, the phase becomes more negative, reaching a minimum around 10 rad/s, with a value of approximately -135°.\n    *   Beyond this point, the phase starts to increase again, reaching a maximum at high frequencies (around 1000 rad/s), with a value of approximately 45°.\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagram shows that the system has a low-pass characteristic, with a cutoff frequency around 10 rad/s. The magnitude decreases significantly beyond this point, while the phase becomes more negative before increasing again at higher frequencies. 8–14 Bode diagram of $4/[s(s^{2}+1)]$ .  \n\nWe need the phase margin of at least $50^{\\circ}$ and gain margin of $10\\ \\mathrm{dB}$ or more. From the Bode diagram of Figure 8–14, we notice that the gain crossover frequency is approximately $\\omega=1.8$ rad 'sec. Let us assume the gain crossover frequency of the compensated system to be somewhere between $\\omega=1$ and $\\omega\\,=\\,10$ rad 'sec. Noting that  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{4(a s\\,+\\,1)(b s\\,+\\,1)}{s}\n$$  \n\nwe choose $a\\,=\\,5$ .Then, $(a s\\,+\\,1)$ will contribute up to $90^{\\circ}$ phase lead in the highfrequency region. MATLAB Program 8–3 produces the Bode diagram of  \n\n$$\n\\frac{4(5s\\,+\\,1)}{s(s^{2}\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nThe resulting Bode diagram is shown in Figure 8–15.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical diagram, specifically a Bode plot, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The title \"MATLAB Program 8-3\" suggests that this is part of a programming exercise or assignment.\n\nHere are the key elements of the diagram:\n\n*   **Title**: The title at the top reads \"Bode Diagram of G(s) = 4(5s+1)/s^2+1\".\n    *   This indicates that the system being modeled has a transfer function represented by the equation.\n*   **Plot Legend**:\n    *   The legend at the bottom left corner shows the different colors used in the plot, with no specific labels provided.\n*   **Frequency Response Plot**: The main plot displays the frequency response of the system, showing how the magnitude and phase angle change as a function of frequency (ω).\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second (rad/s), while the y-axis shows the magnitude and phase angle of the transfer function.\n    *   There are two curves on the plot: one for the magnitude response and another for the phase response.\n*   **Grid Lines**: The grid lines on both axes help to scale the plot and provide a clear visual representation of the frequency response.\n\nIn summary, this Bode diagram illustrates the frequency response of a system with a transfer function represented by the given equation. The plot provides valuable information about how the system's behavior changes as the input frequency varies, which is essential for analyzing and designing control systems.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two plots: one for magnitude and one for phase.\n\n*   **Magnitude Plot**\n    *   The magnitude plot shows the gain of the system as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the frequency in radians per second (rad/s).\n    *   The y-axis represents the magnitude of the transfer function on a logarithmic scale, ranging from -20 dB to 60 dB.\n    *   The magnitude response is characterized by a peak at approximately 1 rad/s, indicating a resonance or gain boost at this frequency.\n    *   The response rolls off at higher frequencies, with a slope that appears to be around -40 dB/decade.\n*   **Phase Plot**\n    *   The phase plot shows the phase shift of the system as a function of frequency.\n    *   The x-axis represents the same frequency axis as the magnitude plot (rad/s).\n    *   The y-axis represents the phase angle in degrees, ranging from -180° to 0°.\n    *   The phase response is relatively flat at low frequencies, indicating little phase shift.\n    *   As the frequency increases, the phase response begins to deviate from zero, with a slope that appears to be around -90°/decade.\n\nIn summary, the Bode diagram provides valuable insights into the frequency response characteristics of a system. The magnitude plot reveals a resonance at approximately 1 rad/s and a roll-off at higher frequencies, while the phase plot shows a relatively flat response at low frequencies with increasing phase deviation at higher frequencies. These findings can inform the design and analysis of control systems, filters, and other applications where understanding frequency response is crucial. 8–15 Bode diagram of $G(s)\\,=\\,4(5s\\,+\\,1)/$ $\\left[s(s^{2}+1)\\right]$ .  \n\nBased on the Bode diagram of Figure 8–15, we choose the value of $^b$ .The term $(b s+1)$ needs to give the phase margin of at least $50^{\\circ}$ . By simple MATLAB trials, we find $b=0.25$ to give the phase margin of at least $50^{\\circ}$ and gain margin of $+\\infty$ dB.Therefore, by choosing $b=0.25$ ,we have  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{4(5s\\,+\\,1)(0.25s\\,+\\,1)}{s}\n$$  \n\nand the open-loop transfer function of the designed system becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\operatorname{Open-loop\\transfer\\function}={\\frac{4(5s\\ +1)(0.25s\\ +1)}{s}}{\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\ +1}}}\\\\ {={\\frac{5s^{2}\\ +21s\\ +4}{s^{3}\\ +s}}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 8–4 produces the Bode diagram of the open-loop transfer function. The resulting Bode diagram is shown in Figure 8–16. From it we see that the static velocity error constant is $4~\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , the phase margin is $55^{\\circ}$ , and the gain margin is $+\\infty$ dB.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program that generates a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The program consists of three main components: \n\n*   **Plotting Commands**: These commands are used to create the plot and customize its appearance.\n*   **Data Generation**: This section calculates the values required for the Bode diagram based on specific mathematical formulas.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n\nThe code begins by defining several variables:\n\n*   `w` represents the frequency in radians per second (rad/s).\n*   `num` and `den` represent the numerator and denominator of the transfer function, respectively.\n*   `bode(num, den)` is a built-in MATLAB function that generates the Bode diagram.\n\n**Step 2: Generate Data**\n\nThe code then calculates the values required for the Bode diagram:\n\n*   It uses a loop to iterate over a range of frequencies from 0.1 rad/s to 1000 rad/s.\n*   For each frequency, it computes the magnitude and phase of the transfer function using the `abs` and `angle` functions.\n\n**Step 3: Plot Data**\n\nFinally, the code plots the magnitude and phase responses as functions of frequency:\n\n*   It uses the `semilogx` function to create a semilogarithmic plot with linear vertical axis (magnitude) and logarithmic horizontal axis (frequency).\n*   The resulting plot displays the Bode diagram for the specified transfer function.\n\nIn summary, this code generates a Bode diagram that illustrates the frequency response of a system represented by its transfer function.  \n\nThe image depicts a Bode diagram, which is used to analyze and visualize the frequency response of a system.\n\n**Title:** The title at the top of the image reads \"Bode Diagram of 4(5s+1)(0.25s+1)/[s(s^2+10)]\".\n\n**Graph Structure:**\n\n*   **Top Graph:** The upper graph represents the magnitude response, with the x-axis labeled as \"Frequency (rad/sec)\" and ranging from -200 to 100. The y-axis is labeled as \"Magnitude (dB)\" and spans from -50 to 100.\n*   **Bottom Graph:** The lower graph displays the phase response, with the x-axis also labeled as \"Frequency (rad/sec)\" but now extending from -2 to 10. The y-axis is labeled as \"Phase (deg)\" and ranges from -200 to 100.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Magnitude Response:** The magnitude response plot shows a peak around 1 rad/sec, indicating that the system has a resonant frequency at this point.\n*   **Phase Response:** The phase response plot exhibits a sharp drop in phase angle as the frequency increases beyond 5 rad/sec, suggesting a significant change in the system's behavior at higher frequencies.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides valuable insights into the frequency-dependent characteristics of the system. The magnitude response indicates that the system has a peak gain around 1 rad/sec, while the phase response suggests a shift from positive to negative phase angles as the frequency increases beyond 5 rad/sec. These observations can be used to inform the design and analysis of control systems or filters. 8–16 $4(5s\\,+\\,1)(0.25s\\,+\\,1)/$ Bode diagram of D$\\left[s(s^{2}+1)\\right]$ .  \n\nTherefore, the designed system satisfies all the requirements.Thus, the designed system is acceptable. (Note that there exist infinitely many systems that satisfy all the requirements.The present system is just one of them.)  \n\nNext, we shall obtain the unit-step response and the unit-ramp response of the designed system.The closed-loop transfer function is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{5s^{2}\\,+\\,21s\\,+\\,4}{s^{3}\\,+\\,5s^{2}\\,+\\,22s\\,+\\,4}\n$$  \n\nNote that the closed-loop zeros are located at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-4,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-0.2\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop poles are located at  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{s=-2.4052\\,+\\,j3.9119}}\\\\ {{\\,s=-2.4052\\,-\\,j3.9119}}\\\\ {{\\,s=-0.1897}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNotice that the complex-conjugate closed-loop poles have the damping ratio of 0.5237.   \nMATLAB Program 8–5 produces the unit-step response and the unit-ramp response.  \n\nThe image presents a code snippet for MATLAB, specifically designed to generate plots of unit-step and unit-ramp responses. The code is organized into three main sections: \"Unit-Step Response,\" \"Unit-Ramp Response,\" and \"Compensated System.\" Each section contains specific commands that define the input signals, plot parameters, and output labels.\n\n**Code Structure**\n\n*   **Unit-Step Response**\n    *   `num = [5 21 4];` defines a numerator polynomial for the transfer function\n    *   `den = [1 5 22 4];` defines a denominator polynomial for the transfer function\n    *   `t = 0:0.01:14;` sets up an array of time points from 0 to 14 seconds with a step size of 0.01 seconds\n    *   `c = step(num,den,t);` computes the unit-step response at each time point\n    *   `plot(t,c);` plots the unit-step response against time\n    *   `title('Unit-Step Response');` sets the title of the plot\n*   **Unit-Ramp Response**\n    *   `num1 = [5 21 4];` defines a numerator polynomial for the transfer function\n    *   `den1 = [1 5 22 4];` defines a denominator polynomial for the transfer function\n    *   `t = 0:0.02:20;` sets up an array of time points from 0 to 20 seconds with a step size of 0.02 seconds\n    *   `c = ramp(num1,den1,t);` computes the unit-ramp response at each time point\n    *   `plot(t,c);` plots the unit-ramp response against time\n    *   `title('Unit-Ramp Response');` sets the title of the plot\n*   **Compensated System**\n    *   `num2 = [5 21 4];` defines a numerator polynomial for the transfer function\n    *   `den2 = [1 5 22 4];` defines a denominator polynomial for the transfer function\n    *   `t = 0:0.01:14;` sets up an array of time points from 0 to 14 seconds with a step size of 0.01 seconds\n    *   `c = step(num2,den2,t);` computes the unit-step response at each time point\n    *   `plot(t,c);` plots the compensated system's unit-step response against time\n    *   `title('Unit-Step Response of Compensated System');` sets the title of the plot\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe provided code generates three plots: one for the unit-step response, another for the unit-ramp response, and a third for the compensated system's unit-step response. These plots allow for visualization of the time-domain responses of the systems defined by the given transfer functions.\n\n*Answer*: The code is used to generate plots of unit-step and unit-ramp responses for different systems.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a single continuous black line, set against a white background. The x-axis is labeled \"t (sec)\" and spans from 0 to 14 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled \"Output c(t)\" and ranges from 0 to 1.4.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Line Graph:** A single continuous black line dominates the graph, featuring a smooth curve with no visible interruptions or breaks.\n*   **Axes Labels:** The x-axis is clearly labeled as \"t (sec),\" indicating that it represents time in seconds. Similarly, the y-axis is labeled as \"Output c(t),\" suggesting that it measures output values over time.\n*   **Range and Scale:** Both axes have defined ranges, with the x-axis spanning from 0 to 14 seconds and the y-axis ranging from 0 to 1.4. This suggests a focus on examining output dynamics within this specific timeframe.\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nGiven the absence of additional context or information about the data being represented, it is challenging to draw concrete conclusions regarding the graph's meaning or significance. However, based solely on the visual representation:\n\n*   The line graph exhibits a gradual increase in output values over time, with some fluctuations.\n*   There are no visible outliers, anomalies, or abrupt changes in the data.\n\nWithout further details about the underlying data, the purpose of this line graph remains unclear. It is essential to consider the specific context and nature of the data being plotted to accurately interpret its implications. 8–17 Unit-step response curve.  \n\nThe resulting unit-step response curve is shown in Figure 8–17 and the unitramp response curve in Figure 8–18. Notice that the closed-loop pole at $s=-0.1897$ and the zero at $s\\,=\\,-0.2$ produce a long tail of small amplitude in the unit-step response.  \n\nFor an additional example of design of a PID controller based on the frequencyresponse approach, see Problem A–8–7 .  \n\nThe image displays a line graph with the title \"Unit-Ramp Response of Compensated System\" at the top. The x-axis is labeled \"t (sec)\" and ranges from 0 to 20 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled \"Unit-Ramp Input and Output (t)\" and spans from 0 to 20.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   A single line represents the unit-ramp response of the compensated system.\n*   The line starts at the origin (0, 0) and increases linearly with time until it reaches a maximum value on the y-axis.\n*   The line is labeled \"Compensated System\" with an arrow pointing to its position on the graph.\n\n**Additional Elements:**\n\n*   The background of the graph features a grid pattern, which helps to visualize the relationship between the x and y values.\n*   There are no other notable elements or annotations present in the image.\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe image effectively conveys the unit-ramp response of the compensated system as a linear function of time. The simple yet clear visualization allows for easy interpretation of the data, making it suitable for technical analysis and communication. 8–18 Unit-ramp input and the output curve.  \n\nIn this section we shall explore how to obtain an optimal set (or optimal sets) of parameter values of PID controllers to satisfy the transient response specifications by use of MATLAB.We shall present two examples to illustrate the approach in this section.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 8–2  \n\nConsider the PID-controlled system shown in Figure 8–19.The PID controller is given by  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K\\,\\frac{(s\\,+\\,a)^{2}}{s}\n$$  \n\nIt is desired to find a combination of $K$ and $a$ such that the closed-loop system will have $10\\%$ (or less) maximum overshoot in the unit-step response. (We will not include any other condition in this problem.But other conditions can easily be included,such as that the settling time be less than a specified value. See, for example, Example 8–3.)  \n\nThere may be more than one set of parameters that satisfy the specifications. In this example, we shall obtain all sets of parameters that satisfy the given specifications.  \n\nTo solve this problem with MATLAB, we first specify the region to search for appropriate $K$ and a .We then write a MATLAB program that, in the unit-step response, will find a combination of $K$ and $a$ which will satisfy the criterion that the maximum overshoot is $10\\%$ or less.  \n\nNote that the gain $K$ should not be too large, so as to avoid the possibility that the system require an unnecessarily large power unit.  \n\nAssume that the region to search for $K$ and $a$ is  \n\n$$\n2\\leq K\\leq3\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad0.5\\leq a\\leq1.5\n$$  \n\nIf a solution does not exist in this region, then we need to expand it. In some problems, however, there is no solution, no matter what the search region might be.  \n\nIn the computational approach, we need to determine the step size for each of $K$ and $a$ . In the actual design process,we need to choose step sizes small enough.However,in this example,to avoid an overly large number of computations, we choose the step sizes to be reasonable—say, 0.2 for both $K$ and $a$ .  \n\nTo solve this problem it is possible to write many different MATLAB programs.We present here   \none such program,MATLAB Program 8–6.In this program,notice that we use two “for”loops.We   \nstart the program with the outer loop to vary the $\\bullet K^{\\bullet}$ values. Then we vary the “ a ” values in the   \ninner loop. We proceed by writing the MATLAB program such that the nested loops in the pro  \ngram begin with the lowest values of “ $K$ ” and “ $^a$ ” and step toward the highest. Note that, depend  \ning on the system and the ranges of search for “ $K$ ” and “ $a$ ” and the step sizes chosen, it may take   \nfrom several seconds to a few minutes for MATLAB to compute the desired sets of the values. In this program the statement  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{s o l u t i o n(k,:)=[k(i)\\Delta~a(j)\\Delta~m]}\n$$  \n\nwill produce a table of $K,a,m$ values. (In the present system there are 15 sets of $K$ and $a$ that will exhibit $m<1.10\\AA$ —that is, the maximum overshoot is less than $10\\%$ .)  \n\nFigure 8–19 PID-controlled system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, featuring a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller and its inputs/outputs. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the architecture of the control loop.\n\n* A block diagram of a control system with a PID controller\n\t+ The block diagram consists of several components, including:\n\t\t- R(s): Reference input\n\t\t- C(s): Controlled variable\n\t\t- K: Proportional gain\n\t\t- Ti: Integral time constant\n\t\t- Td: Derivative time constant\n\t\t- e(s): Error signal\n\t\t- u(s): Control output\n\nThe main findings from the image are:\n\n* The control system uses a PID controller to regulate the controlled variable C(s) based on the reference input R(s).\n* The error signal e(s) is calculated as the difference between the reference input and the controlled variable.\n* The proportional gain K, integral time constant Ti, and derivative time constant Td are used to adjust the control output u(s).\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a basic PID control system architecture, which is widely used in various industrial applications.  \n\nTo sort out the solution sets in the order of the magnitude of the maximum overshoot  (starting from the smallest value of $_m$ and ending at the largest value of $_m$ in the table),we use the command  \n\nsortsolution $=$ sortrows(solution,3)  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program for solving a system of linear equations, with a focus on evaluating closed-loop unit-step response at each 'K' and 'a' combination. The program is designed to test the values of 'K' and 'a', calculate the maximum overshoot, and determine the optimal value of 'K' that yields the smallest maximum overshoot.\n\n**MATLAB Program**\n\n*   The program begins by defining variables `K` and `a`, which represent the gain and damping ratio of a second-order system.\n*   It then calculates the roots of the characteristic equation using the formula for the roots of a quadratic polynomial: `-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)` / (2a).\n*   The program uses a loop to iterate through different values of `K` and `a`, calculating the maximum overshoot for each combination.\n*   The maximum overshoot is calculated using the formula: `max(1, max(abs(y(t))) - 1)`, where `y(t)` is the response of the system at time `t`.\n*   The program uses a conditional statement to check if the current value of `K` and `a` results in a maximum overshoot less than or equal to 10%. If so, it prints out the values of `K` and `a` that achieve this condition.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   **Evaluating Closed-Loop Unit-Step Response**: The program evaluates the closed-loop unit-step response at each 'K' and 'a' combination, providing insight into the behavior of the system under different conditions.\n*   **Optimization**: The program optimizes the value of `K` to achieve a maximum overshoot less than or equal to 10%, ensuring that the system meets the desired performance criteria.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe MATLAB program provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating and optimizing the closed-loop unit-step response of a second-order system. By iterating through different values of `K` and `a`, it identifies the optimal value of `K` that yields the smallest maximum overshoot, ensuring the system meets the desired performance criteria. The program's use of mathematical formulas and conditional statements makes it an efficient tool for solving this type of problem.  \n\nsortsolution $=$ 2.0000  0.5000  0.9002 2.2000  0.5000  0.9114 2.4000  0.5000  0.9207 2.6000  0.5000  0.9283 2.8000  0.5000  0.9348 3.0000  0.5000  0.9402 2.0000  0.7000  0.9807 2.2000  0.7000  0.9837 2.4000  0.7000  0.9859 2.6000  0.7000  0.9877 2.8000  0.7000  1.0024 3.0000  0.7000  1.0177 2.0000  0.9000  1.0614 2.2000  0.9000  1.0772 2.4000  0.9000  1.0923   \n$\\%$ Plot the response with the largest overshoot that is less than $10\\%$   \n$\\mathsf{K}=$ sortsolution(k,1)   \n$\\mathsf{K}=$ 2.4000   \na $=$ sortsolution(k,2)   \na = 0.9000   \n$\\mathrm{gc}=\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{K}^{*}[1\\ \\ 2^{*}\\mathsf{a}\\ \\ \\mathsf{a}^{\\wedge}2],\\,[1\\ \\ 0]);$ ;  \n$\\mathrm{G}=\\mathrm{gc}^{*}\\mathrm{g}/(1\\,+\\,\\mathrm{gc}^{*}\\mathrm{g})$ ;  \nstep(G,t)   \ngrid $\\%$ See Figure 8–20   \n$\\%$ If you wish to plot the response with the smallest overshoot that is   \n$\\%$ greater than $0\\%$ , then enter the following values of $^{1}{\\sf K}^{1}$ and $\"\\mathrm{a}^{\\prime}$   \n$\\mathsf{K}=$ sortsolution(11,1)   \n$\\mathsf{K}=$ 2.8000   \na $=$ sortsolution(11,2)   \na = 0.7000   \n$\\mathrm{gc}=\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{K}^{*}[1\\ \\ 2^{*}\\mathsf{a}\\ \\ \\mathsf{a}^{\\wedge}2],\\,[1\\ \\ 0]);$ ;  \n$\\mathrm{G}=\\mathrm{gc}^{*}\\mathrm{g}/(1\\,+\\,\\mathrm{gc}^{*}\\mathrm{g})$ ;  \nstep(G,t)   \ngrid $\\%$ See Figure 8–21  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the step response of a system, with the x-axis representing time in seconds and the y-axis representing amplitude.

After this initial surge, the response gradually decreases, stabilizing at an amplitude of approximately 0.9 by the end of the fifth second.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the line graph provides a clear visual representation of the step response of a system over time, highlighting both its rapid increase and eventual stabilization. This information can be useful for understanding the dynamics of various systems or processes in fields such as control theory, signal processing, and more. 8–20 Unit-step response of the system with $K=2.4$ and $a=0.9$ .(The maximum overshoot is $9.23\\%.$ .)  \n\nTo plot the unit-step response curve of the last set of the $K$ and $a$ values in the sorted table, we enter the commands  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{K}=\\mathsf{s o r t s o l u t i o n}\\left(\\mathsf{k},1\\right)}\\\\ {\\mathsf{a}=\\mathsf{s o r t s o l u t i o n}\\left(\\mathsf{k},2\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nand use the step command.

By carefully analyzing the curves and their labels, one can gain valuable insights into the relationships between variables and how they influence the amplitude over time. 8–22 Unit-step response curves of system with $K=2$ ,$a=0.9$ ;$K=2.2$ ,$a=0.9$ ;and $K=2.4$ ,$a=0.9$ .  \n\nTo plot the unit-step response curve of the system with any set shown in the sorted table, we specify the $K$ and $a$ values by entering an appropriate sortsolution command.  \n\nNote that for a specification that the maximum overshoot be between $10\\%$ and $5\\%$ ,there would be three sets of solutions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l l}{{K=2.0000,\\;\\;\\;}}&{{a=0.9000,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;m=1.0614}}\\\\ {{K=2.2000,\\;\\;\\;}}&{{a=0.9000,\\;\\;\\;\\;}}&{{m=1.0772}}\\\\ {{K=2.4000,\\;\\;\\;}}&{{a=0.9000,\\;\\;\\;\\;}}&{{m=1.0923}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n# EXAMPLE 8–3  \n\nUnit-step response curves for these three cases are shown in Figure 8–22. Notice that the system with a larger gain $K$ has a smaller rise time and larger maximum overshoot.Which one of these three systems is best depends on the system’s objective.  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 8–23. We want to find all combinations of $K$ and $a$ values such that the closed-loop system has a maximum overshoot of less than $15\\%$ , but more than $10\\%$ ,in the unit-step response. In addition, the settling time should be less than 3 sec.

The diagram consists of several blocks, each representing a different component or process within the system.\n\n*   **PID Controller**\n    *   A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is a type of feedback control mechanism commonly used in industrial processes and other applications.\n    *   It has three main components: proportional, integral, and derivative.\n    *   The proportional term responds to the current error between the desired output and actual output.\n    *   The integral term accumulates past errors and adjusts the control action accordingly.\n    *   The derivative term predicts future behavior based on current rate of change.\n*   **Plant**\n    *   In this context, \"plant\" refers to the physical system being controlled by the controller.\n    *   It is represented as a transfer function G(s), which describes how the plant responds to input signals.\n    *   The transfer function includes parameters that affect its behavior, such as gain and time constants.\n*   **Reference Signal**\n    *   The reference signal R(s) represents the desired output of the system.\n    *   It is used by the controller to determine how much correction is needed.\n    *   In many cases, this could be a constant value or another input signal that changes over time.\n*   **Feedback Loop**\n    *   Feedback loops are crucial in control systems as they allow the system to adjust its behavior based on current conditions.\n    *   The output of the plant is fed back into the controller, creating a continuous cycle where the controller adjusts its action based on this feedback.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a basic feedback control loop consisting of a PID controller and a plant. This setup allows for precise control over the system's behavior by adjusting the control inputs in response to changes in the output signals.  \n\nIn this problem, we choose the step sizes to be reasonable, — say 0.2 for $K$ and 0.1 for a . MATLAB Program 8–7 gives the solution to this problem. From the sortsolution table, it looks like the first row is a good choice.Figure 8–24 shows the unit step response curve for $K=3.2$ and $a\\!=\\!0.9.$ .Since this choice requires a smaller $K$ value than most other choices,we may decide that the first row is the best choice.  \n\nThe image presents a computer program written in MATLAB, specifically designed for solving linear equations. The program is titled \"MATLAB Program 8-7\" and features a white background with black text.\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   The title of the program is displayed at the top-left corner of the image.\n    *   It reads \"MATLAB Program 8-7\".\n*   **Code**\n    *   The main body of the image consists of a block of code written in MATLAB syntax.\n    *   The code defines functions, performs calculations, and outputs results.\n    *   It includes variables, loops, conditional statements, and function calls.\n*   **Output**\n    *   Below the code, there is a table displaying the output of the program.\n    *   The table has multiple rows and columns, with each row representing a solution to the linear equation.\n    *   Each column corresponds to a specific variable or value in the equation.\n*   **Mathematical Notation**\n    *   Throughout the code and output, mathematical notation is used extensively.\n    *   Symbols such as x, y, z, and others are employed to represent variables and constants.\n    *   Mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are also represented using standard symbols (+, -, \\*, /).\n*   **White Background**\n    *   The background of the image is plain white, providing a clean and neutral visual environment for the program.\n\nIn summary, the image showcases a MATLAB program designed to solve linear equations, featuring a clear title, well-structured code, and organized output. The use of mathematical notation throughout the program allows for precise representation of variables and operations.  \n\nThe image presents a table and code snippet related to sorting algorithms, with the primary focus being on understanding the efficiency of different sorting techniques.\n\n*   The table displays the time taken by various sorting methods (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) for increasing sizes of input arrays.\n    *   The columns represent the number of elements in the array, and the rows show the corresponding execution times in milliseconds.\n    *   Notably, Bubble Sort's performance degrades as the array size increases, while other methods like Merge Sort and Quick Sort exhibit more consistent behavior.\n*   Below the table is a code snippet written in Python that implements these sorting algorithms:\n    *   Each algorithm has its own function definition within a larger `sortAlgorithms` class.\n    *   The functions take an input list (`lst`) as parameter and return a sorted version of it using the respective sorting method.\n*   To facilitate testing, several test cases are provided at the end of the code:\n    *   These include generating random lists with varying sizes (e.g., 10, 100) to evaluate performance across different scenarios.\n\nIn summary, this image compares and contrasts the efficiency of various sorting algorithms through both a tabular analysis and an accompanying Python code snippet. It allows for a visual understanding of how these algorithms perform under increasing loads and provides practical implementation examples to further explore their characteristics.  \n\nThe image presents a unit-step response graph, which is a fundamental concept in control systems. The graph displays the output of a system in response to a sudden change or step input.\n\nHere are the key features of the graph:\n\n*   **Graph Title:** Unit-Step Response\n*   **X-Axis:**\n    *   Label: t sec (time in seconds)\n    *   Range: 0 to 6 seconds\n*   **Y-Axis:**\n    *   Label: Output y(t)\n    *   Range: 0 to 1.4\n*   **Unit-Step Response Curve:**\n    *   The curve starts at 0 and increases rapidly, reaching a peak value around 1.2.\n    *   It then decreases gradually, approaching an asymptote at approximately 1.\n\nIn summary, the graph illustrates how a system responds to a unit-step input, showing a rapid increase followed by a gradual decrease towards a stable state. 8–24 Unit-step response curve of the system with $K=3.2$ and $a=0.9$ .  \n\nConsider the basic PID control system shown in Figure 8–25(a), where the system is subjected to disturbances and noises.Figure 8–25(b) is a modified block diagram of the same system.In the basic PID control system such as the one shown in Figure 8–25(b),if the reference input is a step function, then, because of the presence of the derivative term in the control action,the manipulated variable $u(t)$ will involve an impulse function (delta function). In an actual PID controller, instead of the pure derivative term $T_{d}s$ , we employ  \n\n$$\n\\frac{T_{d}s}{1\\,+\\,\\gamma T_{d}s}\n$$  \n\nwhere the value of $\\gamma$ is somewhere around 0.1.Therefore, when the reference input is a step function,the manipulated variable $u(t)$ will not involve an impulse function,but will involve a sharp pulse function. Such a phenomenon is called set-point kick .  \n\nPI-D Control. To avoid the set-point kick phenomenon, we may wish to operate the derivative action only in the feedback path so that differentiation occurs only on the feedback signal and not on the reference signal.The control scheme arranged in this way is called the PI-D control. Figure 8–26 shows a PI-D-controlled system.  \n\nFrom Figure 8–26, it can be seen that the manipulated signal $U(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nU(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\bigg)R(s)\\,-\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)B(s)\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the control system for an uncertain plant, comprising two primary components: **Block Diagram (a)** and **Internal Structure of PID Controller (b)**. The block diagram (a) depicts the overall control system architecture, while the internal structure of the PID controller (b) provides detailed information about its components.\n\n**Overall System Components**\n\n*   **Reference Input**: $R(s)$\n    *   Represents the desired output of the system.\n*   **PID Controller**: $\\mathcal{C}(s)$\n    *   Takes in the error signal and generates a control action to regulate the plant's behavior.\n*   **Plant**: $G_p(s)$\n    *   The process being controlled, characterized by its transfer function.\n*   **Disturbance**: $D(s)$\n    *   Represents external disturbances affecting the system.\n*   **Output**: $Y(s)$\n    *   The actual output of the system.\n\n**PID Controller**\n\nThe PID controller is a crucial component in this control system. It consists of three primary elements:\n\n1.  **Proportional (P) Term**\n    *   Provides a correction based on the current error value.\n2.  **Integral (I) Term**\n    *   Compensates for the accumulated error over time by adjusting the controller's output accordingly.\n3.  **Derivative (D) Term**\n    *   Anticipates future errors and adjusts the controller's output to mitigate them.\n\nThese terms work together to ensure stable and accurate control of the plant despite disturbances or changes in operating conditions.\n\n**Internal Structure of PID Controller**\n\nThe internal structure of the PID controller reveals its detailed components:\n\n*   **Error Signal**: $e(s)$\n    *   Calculated as the difference between the reference input and the current output.\n*   **Proportional Gain (Kp)**: Adjusts the proportional term's impact on the control action.\n*   **Integral Gain (Ki)**: Determines the rate at which the integral term contributes to the control action.\n*   **Derivative Gain (Kd)**: Controls the derivative term's influence on the control action.\n\nThese gains allow for customization of the PID controller's behavior according to specific system requirements or preferences.\n\n**Overall System Dynamics**\n\nThe block diagram illustrates how these components interact:\n\n1.  The reference input is fed into the PID controller, which processes it along with feedback from the plant.\n2.  The PID controller generates a control signal based on its output and sends it back to the plant.\n3.  The plant responds by adjusting its behavior according to the received control signal.\n4.  The output of the plant is then fed back into the system as part of the overall feedback loop.\n\nThis closed-loop structure enables the system to continuously monitor its performance, make adjustments as needed, and maintain stability in the face of disturbances or changes in operating conditions. 8–25 (a) PID-controlled system; (b) equivalent block diagram.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of signal processing, comprising two distinct diagrams. The top diagram features a block with an input labeled \"R(s)\" and an output marked as \"Y(s)\". Within this block, there is a multiplication operation denoted by the symbol for multiplication, accompanied by a constant value of 1. This suggests that the input R(s) is being multiplied by 1, resulting in an unchanged output.\n\n**Top Diagram:**\n\n*   **Input:** R(s)\n*   **Output:** Y(s)\n*   **Block Operation:** Multiplication by 1\n\nThe lower diagram illustrates a more complex signal processing operation. It comprises several blocks connected by arrows, indicating the flow of signals between them. The input to this system is labeled \"D(s)\", while the output is denoted as \"N(s)\". Within these blocks, various mathematical operations are represented using symbols such as addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (x). These operations suggest that the input D(s) undergoes transformations before producing the output N(s).\n\n**Lower Diagram:**\n\n*   **Input:** D(s)\n*   **Output:** N(s)\n*   **Block Operations:** Various mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)\n\nIn summary, the image depicts two signal processing systems. The top diagram shows a simple multiplication operation that leaves the input unchanged, while the lower diagram illustrates a more complex system involving multiple blocks and mathematical operations to transform the input into an output. 8–26 PI-D-controlled system.  \n\nNotice that in the absence of the disturbances and noises, the closed-loop transfer function of the basic PID control system [shown in Figure 8–25(b)] and the PI-D control system (shown in Figure 8–26) are given, respectively, by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\bigg(1+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+T_{d}s\\bigg)\\frac{K_{p}G_{p}(s)}{1+\\bigg(1+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+T_{d}s\\bigg)K_{p}G_{p}(s)}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\left(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\right)\\frac{K_{p}G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,\\left(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+\\,T_{d}s\\right)K_{p}G_{p}(s)}\n$$  \n\nIt is important to point out that in the absence of the reference input and noises, the closed-loop transfer function between the disturbance $D(s)$ and the output $Y(s)$ in either case is the same and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,K_{p}G_{p}(s)\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)}\n$$  \n\nI-PD Control. Consider the case where the reference input is a step function. Both PID control and PI-D control involve a step function in the manipulated signal. Such a step change in the manipulated signal may not be desirable in many occasions. Therefore, it may be advantageous to move the proportional action and derivative action to the feedback path so that these actions affect the feedback signal only.Figure 8–27 shows such a control scheme. It is called the I-PD control.The manipulated signal is given by  \n\n$$\nU(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,R(s)\\,-\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)B(s)\n$$  \n\nNotice that the reference input $R(s)$ appears only in the integral control part. Thus, in I-PD control, it is imperative to have the integral control action for proper operation of the control system.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section illustrates the input processing, while the bottom section represents the output processing.\n\n*   **Top Section (Input Processing)**\n    *   The input signal, denoted as R(s), enters the system through an adder.\n        *   This adder combines the input with another signal, represented by a box labeled \"1/TiS,\" which is connected to a summing junction.\n            *   The output of this summing junction is fed into a block representing a first-order lag component, characterized by the transfer function TiS/(TiS + 1).\n                *   This transfer function indicates that the system incorporates a time constant (Ti) and a gain factor (s), resulting in a first-order lag response.\n                    *   The output of this lag component is then connected to another adder, where it is combined with an additional signal from a box labeled \"Kp.\"\n                        *   This Kp term is likely related to the proportional gain of the system, although its exact nature is not specified.\n                            *   The resulting sum is then input into the bottom section of the diagram for further processing.\n\n*   **Bottom Section (Output Processing)**\n    *   In this lower portion, the combined signal from the top section enters a block representing a derivative component with a transfer function Tds.\n        *   This transfer function suggests that the system incorporates a time constant (Td) and a gain factor (s), resulting in a derivative response.\n            *   The output of this derivative component is connected to an adder, where it is combined with another signal from a box labeled \"Gp(s).\"\n                *   Gp(s) likely represents a proportional gain term similar to Kp in the top section but operates within the frequency domain (s-domain).\n                    *   The sum of these two signals is then fed into an integrator block characterized by a transfer function 1/s.\n                        *   This integration process contributes to the system's overall response, allowing it to track changes over time.\n                            *   Finally, the output of the integrator is connected to a box labeled \"N(s),\" which might represent noise or disturbance inputs to the system.\n                                *   The interaction between these components and their outputs allows for the control system to manage both steady-state errors and transient responses effectively.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a control system that incorporates multiple components for input processing, including first-order lag, proportional gain, and derivative actions. These components are integrated with an output processing section featuring an integrator and potentially noise/disturbance handling capabilities. This complex interplay enables the system to respond appropriately to various inputs and disturbances, ensuring stable and effective operation.  \n\nFigure 8–27   \nI-PD-controlled system.  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/R(s)$ in the absence of the disturbance input and noise input is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}=\\,\\bigg({\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}}\\bigg)\\,{\\frac{K_{p}G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,K_{p}G_{p}(s)\\bigg(1\\,+\\,{\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}}+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)}}\n$$  \n\nIt is noted that in the absence of the reference input and noise signals,the closed-loop transfer function between the disturbance input and the output is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,K_{p}G_{p}(s)\\bigg(1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\,+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)}\n$$  \n\nThis expression is the same as that for PID control or PI-D control.  \n\nTwo-Degrees-of-Freedom PID Control. We have shown that PI-D control is obtained by moving the derivative control action to the feedback path, and I-PD control is obtained by moving the proportional control and derivative control actions to the feedback path. Instead of moving the entire derivative control action or proportional control action to the feedback path, it is possible to move only portions of these control actions to the feedback path, retaining the remaining portions in the feedforward path. In the literature, PI-PD control has been proposed. The characteristics of this control scheme lie between PID control and I-PD control. Similarly, PID-PD control can be considered. In these control schemes, we have a controller in the feedforward path and another controller in the feedback path. Such control schemes lead us to a more general two-degrees-of-freedom control scheme.We shall discuss details of such a two-degreesof-freedom control scheme in subsequent sections of this chapter.  \n\n# 8–6 TWO-DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM CONTROL  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 8–28, where the system is subjected to the disturbance input $D(s)$ and noise input $N(s)$ ,in addition to the reference input $R(s)$ .$G_{c}(s)$ is the transfer function of the controller and $G_{p}(s)$ is the transfer function of the plant.We assume that $G_{p}(s)$ is fixed and unalterable.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and signals. The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a distinct part of the system.\n\n**Input Signal**\n\n*   **R(s)**: The input signal to the system, represented by an arrow pointing towards the first component.\n*   **U(s)**: The output of the first component, which serves as the input for the second component.\n\n**First Component (Controller)**\n\n*   **Gc(s)**: A transfer function representing the controller's behavior in the s-domain.\n*   **B(s)**: A block that processes the input signal R(s) and produces an output U(s).\n\n**Second Component (Plant)**\n\n*   **D(s)**: A disturbance signal affecting the plant, represented by an arrow pointing towards the second component.\n*   **Gp(s)**: A transfer function representing the plant's behavior in the s-domain.\n\n**Output Signal**\n\n*   **Y(s)**: The output of the system, resulting from the combination of the controller and plant outputs.\n*   **N(s)**: Noise signal affecting the measurement, represented by an arrow pointing towards the output.\n\nThe diagram illustrates how the input signal R(s) is processed through the controller Gc(s), which produces an output U(s). This output then serves as the input for the plant Gp(s), which generates an output Y(s). However, the actual measured output is affected by both the plant's output and a noise signal N(s).\n\nIn summary, the block diagram represents a closed-loop control system with a controller, plant, and measurement noise. The system aims to regulate the output Y(s) based on the input R(s), while accounting for disturbances D(s) and measurement errors N(s). 8–28 One-degree-offreedom control system.  \n\nFor this system, three closed-loop transfer functions $Y(s)/R(s)\\,=\\,G_{y r}$ ,$Y(s)/D(s)\\,=\\,G_{y d}$ ,and $Y(s)/N(s)\\,=\\,G_{y n}$ may be derived.They are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle G_{y r}=\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{c}G_{p}}{1+G_{c}G_{p}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle G_{y d}=\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1+G_{c}G_{p}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle G_{y n}=\\frac{Y(s)}{N(s)}=-\\frac{G_{c}G_{p}}{1+G_{c}G_{p}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n[In deriving $Y(s)/R(s)$ ,we assumed $D(s)\\,=\\,0$ and $N(s)\\,=\\,0$ .Similar comments apply to the derivations of $Y(s)/D(s)$ and $Y(s)/N(s).]$ The degrees of freedom of the control system refers to how many of these closed-loop transfer functions are independent. In the present case, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{G_{y r}=\\frac{G_{p}-G_{y d}}{G_{p}}}\\\\ {G_{y n}=\\frac{G_{y d}-G_{p}}{G_{p}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAmong the three closed-loop transfer functions $G_{y r},\\,G_{y n}$ ,and $G_{y d}$ , if one of them is given, the remaining two are fixed.This means that the system shown in Figure 8–28 is a one-degree-of-freedom control system.  \n\nNext consider the system shown in Figure 8–29, where $G_{p}(s)$ is the transfer function of the plant. For this system, closed-loop transfer functions $G_{y r}$ ,$G_{y n}$ ,and $G_{y d}$ are given, respectively, by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle G_{y r}=\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{c1}G_{p}}{1+\\big(G_{c1}+G_{c2}\\big)G_{p}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle G_{y d}=\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1+\\big(G_{c1}+G_{c2}\\big)G_{p}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle G_{y n}=\\frac{Y(s)}{N(s)}=-\\frac{\\big(G_{c1}+G_{c2}\\big)G_{p}}{1+\\big(G_{c1}+G_{c2}\\big)G_{p}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a signal processing system, comprising various components and connections. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top section focuses on processing signals, while the bottom section deals with input/output operations.\n\n**Top Section: Processing Signals**\n\n*   **Input Signal**: The process begins with an input signal represented by the symbol \"R(s)\".\n*   **Filtering**: This signal is then fed into a filter denoted as \"Gc1(s)\". The output of this filter is labeled as \"U(s)\".\n*   **Addition**: The filtered signal is added to another signal, \"D(s)\", and the result is represented by the symbol \"+\".\n*   **Gain Adjustment**: The combined signal undergoes a gain adjustment operation through the element \"Gc2(s)\". The output of this process is labeled as \"B(s)\".\n*   **Output Signal**: Finally, the processed signal \"B(s)\" serves as the input to another filter denoted as \"Gp(s)\". The resulting output signal is represented by the symbol \"Y(s)\".\n\n**Bottom Section: Input/Output Operations**\n\n*   **Input/Output Connection**: In the bottom section of the diagram, there are two connections:\n    *   An arrow pointing downwards from \"R(s)\" to \"N(s)\", indicating that the input signal \"R(s)\" is connected to an output or another part of the system.\n    *   An arrow pointing upwards from \"Y(s)\" back to \"R(s)\", showing a feedback loop where the processed signal \"Y(s)\" feeds back into the original input signal.\n\n**Overall Structure**\n\nThe diagram illustrates a closed-loop control system where the input signal is processed through various filters and gain adjustments before being fed back into the system as part of the output. This setup allows for continuous monitoring and adjustment based on the feedback loop, enabling real-time optimization or correction of the input signal according to the desired outcome. 8–29 Two-degrees-offreedom control system.  \n\nHence, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{G_{y r}=G_{c1}G_{y d}}\\\\ {G_{y n}=\\displaystyle\\frac{G_{y d}-G_{p}}{G_{p}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn this case, if $G_{y d}$ is given, then $G_{y n}$ is fixed, but $G_{y r}$ is not fixed, because $G_{c1}$ is independent of $G_{y d}$ .Thus, two closed-loop transfer functions among three closed-loop transfer functions $G_{y r}$ ,$G_{y d}$ ,and $G_{y n}$ are independent.Hence,this system is a two-degreesof-freedom control system.  \n\nSimilarly, the system shown in Figure 8–30 is also a two-degrees-of-freedom control system, because for this system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{G_{y r}=\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{c1}G_{p}}{1+G_{c1}G_{p}}+\\frac{G_{c2}G_{p}}{1+G_{c1}G_{p}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{G_{y d}=\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1+G_{c1}G_{p}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{G_{y n}=\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{N(s)}=-\\frac{G_{c1}G_{p}}{1+G_{c1}G_{p}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a signal processing system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section illustrates the input and output signals, while the bottom section focuses on the processing stages.\n\n**Top Section: Input and Output Signals**\n\n*   A single input signal, denoted as $R(s)$, enters the system from the left.\n*   Two output signals emerge from the system:\n    *   The first output, labeled $D(s)$, exits to the right.\n    *   The second output, denoted as $B(s)$, exits downwards.\n\n**Bottom Section: Processing Stages**\n\n*   **Processing Stage 1**\n    *   The input signal $R(s)$ is multiplied by a constant gain factor $G_{c2}(s)$ and fed into a transfer function block labeled $G_p(s)$.\n    *   The output of this stage, denoted as $U(s)$, is then passed through another transfer function block with the same label $G_p(s)$.\n*   **Processing Stage 2**\n    *   The input signal $D(s)$ is multiplied by a constant gain factor $G_{c1}(s)$ and fed into a transfer function block labeled $G_c(s)$.\n    *   The output of this stage, denoted as $Y(s)$, is then passed through another transfer function block with the same label $G_c(s)$.\n\n**Interconnections and Notations**\n\n*   Arrows indicate the flow of signals between components.\n*   Transfer functions are represented by blocks with labels such as $G_p(s)$ or $G_c(s)$.\n*   Constant gain factors are denoted using subscripts, e.g., $G_{c2}(s)$.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a signal processing system consisting of multiple stages that manipulate input signals. The top section shows the input and output signals, while the bottom section highlights the processing stages involved in transforming these signals. 8–30 Two-degrees-offreedom control system.  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{G_{y r}=G_{c2}G_{y d}+\\displaystyle\\frac{G_{p}-G_{y d}}{G_{p}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle G_{y n}=\\displaystyle\\frac{G_{y d}-G_{p}}{G_{p}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nClearly, if $G_{y d}$ is given, then $G_{y n}$ is fixed, but $G_{y r}$ is not fixed, because $G_{c2}$ is independent of $G_{y d}$ .  \n\nIt will be seen in Section 8–7 that, in such a two-degrees-of-freedom control system, both the closed-loop characteristics and the feedback characteristics can be adjusted independently to improve the system response performance.  \n\n# 8–7 ZERO-PLACEMENT APPROACH TO IMPROVE RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS  \n\nWe shall show here that by use of the zero-placement approach presented later in this section, we can achieve the following:  \n\nThe responses to the ramp reference input and acceleration reference input exhibit no steady-state errors.  \n\nIn high-performance control systems it is always desired that the system output follow the changing input with minimum error. For step, ramp, and acceleration inputs, it is desired that the system output exhibit no steady-state error.  \n\nIn what follows, we shall demonstrate how to design control systems that will exhibit no steady-state errors in following ramp and acceleration inputs and at the same time force the response to the step disturbance input to approach zero quickly.  \n\nConsider the two-degrees-of-freedom control system shown in Figure 8–31. Assume that the plant transfer function $G_{p}(s)$ is a minimum-phase transfer function and is given by  \n\n$$\nG_{p}(s)\\,=\\,K\\,{\\frac{A(s)}{B(s)}}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a system with multiple components, including filters and amplifiers. The diagram shows the flow of signals through each component, as well as the relationships between them.\n\n*   **Block Diagram:**\n    *   The diagram consists of several blocks, each representing a different component or process in the system.\n    *   Each block has an input and output, indicating the direction of signal flow.\n    *   The blocks are connected by arrows, which represent the flow of signals between them.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   There are five main components in the diagram:\n        *   R(s): a filter\n        *   Gc1(s), Gc2(s): amplifiers\n        *   D(s): another filter\n        *   Y(s): an output signal\n    *   Each component has its own set of inputs and outputs, which are connected to other components in the system.\n*   **Signal Flow:**\n    *   The diagram shows how signals flow through each component, starting with R(s) and ending with Y(s).\n    *   Signals enter the system at the top left corner and exit at the bottom right corner.\n    *   Each block processes the signal it receives from its input, modifying it in some way before passing it on to the next block.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   The diagram illustrates the relationships between the different components of the system.\n    *   For example, R(s) has an output that is connected to the input of Gc1(s).\n    *   Similarly, the output of Gc2(s) is connected to the input of D(s).\n\nOverall, the block diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the system's architecture and signal flow. It allows us to visualize how the different components interact with each other and understand the overall behavior of the system.\n\n**Answer**: The image depicts a block diagram of a system with multiple components, including filters and amplifiers, showing the flow of signals through each component and their relationships. 8–31 Two-degrees-offreedom control system.  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{A(s)\\,=\\,\\bigl(s\\,+\\,z_{1}\\bigr)\\bigl(s\\,+\\,z_{2}\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(s\\,+\\,z_{m}\\bigr)}}\\\\ {{\\phantom{A}B(s)\\,=\\,s^{N}\\bigl(s\\,+\\,p_{N+1}\\bigr)\\bigl(s\\,+\\,p_{N+2}\\bigr)\\cdots\\bigl(s\\,+\\,p_{n}\\bigr)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $N$ may be $0,1,2$ and $n\\geq m$ .Assume also that $G_{c1}$ is a PID controller followed by a filter $1/A(s)$ ,or  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}(s)\\,=\\frac{\\alpha_{1}s\\,+\\,\\beta_{1}\\,+\\,\\gamma_{1}s^{2}}{s}\\frac{1}{A(s)}\n$$  \n\nand $G_{c2}$ is a PID, PI, PD, I, D, or $\\mathrm{P}$ controller followed by a filter $1/A(s)$ .That is  \n\n$$\nG_{c2}(s)\\,={\\frac{\\alpha_{2}s\\,+\\,\\beta_{2}\\,+\\,\\gamma_{2}s^{2}}{s}}{\\frac{1}{A(s)}}\n$$  \n\nwhere some of $\\alpha_{2},\\beta_{2}$ , and $\\gamma_{2}$ may be zero.Then it is possible to write $G_{c1}+G_{c2}$ as  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}\\,+\\,G_{c2}\\,=\\frac{\\alpha s\\,+\\,\\beta\\,+\\,\\gamma s^{2}}{s}\\frac{1}{A(s)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\alpha,\\beta$ , and $\\gamma$ are constants.Then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1+\\big(G_{c1}+G_{c2}\\big)G_{p}}=\\frac{K\\,\\frac{A(s)}{B(s)}}{1+\\frac{\\alpha s\\,+\\,\\beta\\,+\\,\\gamma s^{2}}{s}\\frac{K}{B(s)}}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{s K A(s)}{s B(s)\\,+\\,\\big(\\alpha s\\,+\\,\\beta\\,+\\,\\gamma s^{2}\\big)K}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBecause of the presence of $s$ in the numerator, the response $y(t)$ to a step disturbance input approaches zero as $t$ approaches infinity, as shown below.

Note that $Y(s)/R(s)$ and $Y(s)/D(s)$ are given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{c1}G_{p}}{1\\,+\\,\\bigl(G_{c1}\\,+\\,G_{c2}\\bigr)G_{p}},\\qquad\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1\\,+\\,\\bigl(G_{c1}\\,+\\,G_{c2}\\bigr)G_{p}}\n$$  \n\nNotice that the denominators of $Y(s)/R(s)$ and $Y(s)/D(s)$ are the same. Before we choose the poles of $Y(s)/R(s)$ ,we need to place the zeros of $Y(s)/R(s)$ .  \n\nZero Placement. Consider the system  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{p(s)}{s^{n+1}\\,+\\,a_{n}s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{2}s^{2}\\,+\\,a_{1}s\\,+\\,a_{0}}}\n$$  \n\nIf we choose $p(s)$ as  \n\n$$\np(s)\\,=\\,a_{2}s^{2}\\,+\\,a_{1}s\\,+\\,a_{0}\\,=\\,a_{2}\\bigl(s\\,+\\,s_{1}\\bigr)\\bigl(s\\,+\\,s_{2}\\bigr)\n$$  \n\nthat is, choose the zeros $s=-s_{1}$ and $s=-s_{2}$ such that, together with $a_{2}$ , the numerator polynomial $p(s)$ is equal to the sum of the last three terms of the denominator polynomial—then the system will exhibit no steady-state errors in response to the step input, ramp input, and acceleration input.  \n\nRequirement Placed on System Response Characteristics. Suppose that it is desired that the maximum overshoot in the response to the unit-step reference input be between arbitrarily selected upper and lower limits—for example,  \n\n$$\n2\\%<\\mathrm{maximum~overshoot}<10\\%\n$$  \n\nwhere we choose the lower limit to be slightly above zero to avoid having overdamped systems.The smaller the upper limit, the harder it is to determine the coefficient $a$ ’s. In some cases, no combination of the $a$ ’s may exist to satisfy the specification, so we must allow a higher upper limit for the maximum overshoot.We use MATLAB to search at least one set of the $a$ ’s to satisfy the specification.As a practical computational matter, instead of searching for the $a$ ’s, we try to obtain acceptable closed-loop poles by searching a reasonable region in the left-half $s$ plane for each closed-loop pole.

The plant transfer function $G_{p}(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nG_{p}(s)=\\frac{10}{s(s+1)}\n$$  \n\nDesign controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ such that the maximum overshoot in the response to the unit-step reference input be less than $19\\%$ , but more than $2\\%$ , and the settling time be less than 1 sec. It is desired that the steady-state errors in following the ramp reference input and acceleration reference input be zero.The response to the unit-step disturbance input should have a small amplitude and settle to zero quickly.  \n\nTo design suitable controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ ,first note that  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1\\,+\\,G_{p}\\bigl(G_{c1}\\,+\\,G_{c2}\\bigr)}\n$$  \n\nTo simplify the notation, let us define  \n\n$$\nG_{c}=G_{c1}+G_{c2}\n$$  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1\\,+\\,G_{p}G_{c}}=\\frac{\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}}{1\\,+\\,\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}G_{c}}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{10}{s(s\\,+\\,1)\\,+\\,10G_{c}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the relationships between different components in a system. The diagram shows various blocks and arrows that represent the flow of signals through the system.\n\n*   **Input Block**\n    *   Located on the left side of the diagram\n    *   Labeled as \"R(s)\"\n    *   Represents the input signal to the system\n*   **Controller**\n    *   Located below the input block\n    *   Labeled as \"Gc1(s) + Gc2(s)\"\n    *   Represents the controller that processes the input signal\n*   **Plant**\n    *   Located below the controller\n    *   Labeled as \"Gp(s)\"\n    *   Represents the plant or process being controlled\n*   **Output Block**\n    *   Located on the right side of the diagram\n    *   Labeled as \"Y(s)\"\n    *   Represents the output signal from the system\n\nThe arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of signals through the system. The input block is connected to the controller via an arrow, and the output of the controller is fed back into the plant. The output of the plant is then connected to the output block.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram shows a closed-loop control system with an input block, a controller, a plant, and an output block. The controller processes the input signal and feeds it back into the plant, which generates an output signal that is fed back into the controller. This feedback loop allows the system to regulate its behavior based on the input signal.\n\nThe diagram also shows the transfer functions of each component in the system. The transfer function of the controller is given by Gc1(s) + Gc2(s), and the transfer function of the plant is given by Gp(s). These transfer functions can be used to analyze the behavior of the system and design controllers that meet specific performance requirements.\n\nOverall, the block diagram provides a clear and concise representation of the control system, allowing for easy analysis and design of controllers. 8–33 Two-degreesof-freedom control system.  \n\nSecond, note that  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{G_{p}G_{c1}}{1\\ +\\ G_{p}G_{c}}}={\\frac{10G_{c1}}{s(s\\ +\\ 1)\\ +\\ 10G_{c}}}\n$$  \n\nNotice that the characteristic equation for $Y(s)/D(s)$ and the one for $Y(s)/R(s)$ are identical.  \n\nWe may be tempted to choose a zero of $G_{c}(s)$ at $s=-1$ to cancel a pole at $s=-1$ of the plant $G_{p}(s)$ .However, the canceled pole $s=-1$ becomes a closed-loop pole of the entire system, as seen below. If we define $G_{c}(s)$ as a PID controller such that  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)={\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,\\beta)}{s}}\n$$  \n\nthen  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{10}{s(s+1)+\\frac{10K(s+1)(s+\\beta)}{s}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{10s}{(s+1)\\big[s^{2}+10K(s+\\beta)\\big]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop pole at $s=-1$ is a slow-response pole, and if this closed-loop pole is included in the system, the settling time will not be less than 1 sec.Therefore, we should not choose $G_{c}(s)$ as given by Equation (8–7).  \n\nThe design of controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ consists of two steps.  \n\nDesign Step 1: We design $G_{c}(s)$ to satisfy the requirements on the response to the stepdisturbance input $D(s)$ .In this design stage, we assume that the reference input is zero.  \n\nSuppose that we assume that $G_{c}(s)$ is a PID controller of the form  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,\\alpha)(s\\,+\\,\\beta)}{s}\n$$  \n\nThen the closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/D(s)$ becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{10}{s(s+1)+10G_{c}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{10}{s(s+1)+\\frac{10K(s+\\alpha)(s+\\beta)}{s}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{10s}{s^{2}(s+1)+10K(s+\\alpha)(s+\\beta)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that the presence of “ $\"s'$ in the numerator of $Y(s)/D(s)$ assures that the steady-state response to the step disturbance input is zero.  \n\nLet us assume that the desired dominant closed-loop poles are complex conjugates and are given by  \n\n$$\ns=-a\\,\\pm\\,j b\n$$  \n\nand the remaining closed-loop pole is real and is located at  \n\n$$\ns=-c\n$$  \n\nNote that in this problem there are three requirements. The first requirement is that the response to the step disturbance input damp out quickly.The second requirement is that the maximum overshoot in the response to the unit-step reference input be between $19\\%$ and $2\\%$ and the settling time be less than 1 sec. The third requirement is that the steady-state errors in the responses to both the ramp and acceleration reference inputs be zero.  \n\nA set (or sets) of reasonable values of $a,\\,b$ ,and $c$ must be searched using a computational approach.To satisfy the first requirement, we choose the search region for $a,b$ ,and $c$ to be  \n\n$$\n2\\leq a\\leq6,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;2\\leq b\\leq6,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;6\\leq c\\leq12\n$$  \n\nThis region is shown in Figure 8–34. If the dominant closed-loop poles $s=-a\\,\\pm\\,j b$ are located anywhere in the shaded region,the response to a step disturbance input will damp out quickly.(The first requirement will be met.)  \n\nNotice that the denominator of $Y(s)/D(s)$ can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{s^{2}(s+1)\\,+\\,10K(s\\,+\\,\\alpha)(s\\,+\\,\\beta)}\\\\ &{=s^{3}\\,+\\,(1\\,+\\,10K)s^{2}\\,+\\,10K(\\alpha\\,+\\,\\beta)s\\,+\\,10K\\alpha\\beta}\\\\ &{=\\,(s\\,+\\,a\\,+\\,j b)(s\\,+\\,a\\,-\\,j b)(s\\,+\\,c)}\\\\ &{=s^{3}\\,+\\,(2a\\,+\\,c)s^{2}\\,+\\,\\bigl(a^{2}\\,+\\,b^{2}\\,+\\,2a c\\bigr)s\\,+\\,\\bigl(a^{2}\\,+\\,b^{2}\\bigr)c}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a complex mathematical concept, likely related to signal processing or control systems. The visual content is organized into two main sections: a graph and a legend.\n\n*   **Graph**\n    *   The graph features a 2D plot with axes labeled as \"jω\" (imaginary axis) and \"σ\" (real axis).\n        *   There are two shaded regions in the graph:\n            *   One region is located below the real axis, extending from -10 to 0 on the σ-axis.\n                *   Within this region, there are three distinct parts:\n                    *   The top part has a diagonal pattern with parallel lines and no visible labels or annotations.\n                    *   The middle part appears blank, devoid of any markings or patterns.\n                    *   The bottom part displays diagonal lines with an alternating pattern of darker and lighter shades.\n            *   The other region is situated above the real axis, spanning from -6 to 0 on the σ-axis.\n                *   This region also exhibits a diagonal pattern with parallel lines but lacks visible labels or annotations.\n    *   Additionally, there are two rectangular boxes in the graph:\n        *   One box encloses part of the top shaded region and is labeled \"Region for α and β\".\n        *   The other box encompasses the entire bottom shaded region and is marked as \"Region for γ\".\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe image illustrates a mathematical concept involving complex regions on a 2D plot. Two distinct regions are highlighted: one below the real axis, divided into three parts, and another above the real axis. Each region features diagonal patterns with parallel lines but lacks explicit labels or annotations. Two rectangular boxes enclose specific areas within these regions, labeled as \"Region for α and β\" and \"Region for γ\", respectively. Overall, the image presents a complex visual representation of mathematical concepts, likely related to signal processing or control systems. 8–34 Search regions for $a,b$ ,and $c$ .  \n\nSince the denominators of $Y(s)/D(s)$ and $Y(s)/R(s)$ are the same, the denominator of $Y(s)/D(s)$ determines also the response characteristics for the reference input.To satisfy the third requirement, we refer to the zero-placement method and choose the closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/R(s)$ to be of the following form:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{(2a\\,+\\,c)s^{2}\\,+\\,(a^{2}\\,+\\,b^{2}\\,+\\,2a c)s\\,+\\,(a^{2}\\,+\\,b^{2})c}{s^{3}\\,+\\,(2a\\,+\\,c)s^{2}\\,+\\,(a^{2}\\,+\\,b^{2}\\,+\\,2a c)s\\,+\\,(a^{2}\\,+\\,b^{2})c}}\n$$  \n\nin which case the third requirement is automatically satisfied.  \n\nOur problem then becomes a search of a set or sets of desired closed-loop poles in terms of $a,b.$ ,and $c$ in the specified region, such that the system will satisfy the requirement on the response to the unit-step reference input that the maximum overshoot be between $19\\%$ and $2\\%$ and the settling time be less than 1 sec. (If an acceptable set cannot be found in the search region, we need to widen the region.)  \n\nIn the computational search, we need to assume a reasonable step size. In this problem, we assume it to be 0.2.  \n\nMATLAB Program 8–8 produces a table of sets of acceptable values of $a,b$ ,and $c$ .Using this program, we find that the requirement on the response to the unit-step reference input is met by any of the 23 sets shown in the table in MATLAB Program 8–8. Note that the last row in the table corresponds to the last search point.This point does not satisfy the requirement and thus it should simply be ignored. (In the program written, the last search point produces the last row in the table whether or not it satisfies the requirement.)  \n\nThe image presents a computer program written in MATLAB, specifically designed to solve an optimization problem. The code is titled \"MATLAB Program 8-8\" and is presented in a clear and organized manner.\n\n**Code Structure**\n\n*   The code consists of several sections, each with its own specific function:\n    *   `t = 0:0.01:4;`: This section defines an array `t` that represents time points from 0 to 4 seconds with a step size of 0.01 seconds.\n    *   `k = 0;`: This line initializes a variable `k` to 0.\n    *   `for i = 1:21;`: This loop iterates over the indices of an array, ranging from 1 to 21.\n    *   `a(i) = 6.2 - i*0.2;`: Within the loop, each element in the array `a` is calculated as 6.2 minus the current index multiplied by 0.2.\n    *   `for j = 1:21;`: This loop iterates over the indices of another array, also ranging from 1 to 21.\n    *   `b(j) = 6.2 - j*0.2;`: Within this loop, each element in the array `b` is calculated as 6.2 minus the current index multiplied by 0.2.\n    *   `for h = 1:31;`: This loop iterates over the indices of a third array, ranging from 1 to 31.\n    *   `c(h) = 12.2 - h*0.2;`: Within this loop, each element in the array `c` is calculated as 12.2 minus the current index multiplied by 0.2.\n\n**Key Functions and Variables**\n\n*   `num = [0 2*a(i)+c(h)*a(i)^2+2*b(j)^2+a(i)*b(j)^2+2*c(h)^2+b(j)*c(h)^2];`: This line calculates the value of each element in the array `num` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n*   `den = [1 2*a(i)+b(j)^2+a(i)*b(j)^2+2*c(h)^2+b(j)*c(h)^2];`: This line calculates the value of each element in the array `den` based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n*   `y = step(num, den);`: This function applies a filter to the input signal using the calculated coefficients from `num` and `den`.\n\n**Additional Comments**\n\n*   The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each section and variable.\n*   The program uses MATLAB's built-in functions for filtering and manipulating signals.\n\nIn summary, this MATLAB program is designed to solve an optimization problem by applying a filter to an input signal. It calculates coefficients based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and then applies these coefficients to the input signal using the `step` function. The code is well-organized and includes clear comments explaining each section's purpose.  \n\n(continues on next page )  \n\nThe image presents a table of values with the following features:\n\n*   The table is titled \"table(k,:)\" and has 5 columns.\n*   The first column contains numerical values ranging from 4.2000 to 2.0000, with most values between 3.8000 and 3.6000.\n    *   The values in this column are likely the x-values or input data for some calculation or analysis.\n*   The second column is empty, indicating that it may not be relevant to the context of the table.\n*   The third column contains numerical values ranging from 2.0000 to 1.2163, with most values between 1.8700 and 1.1797.\n    *   These values appear to be related to the first column, possibly as output or result values.\n*   The fourth column is empty, similar to the second column.\n*   The fifth column contains numerical values ranging from 12.0000 to 6.0000, with most values between 11.6000 and 1.2163.\n    *   These values may be related to the first two columns, possibly as intermediate or calculated values.\n\nIn summary, the table appears to present a set of numerical values organized into five columns, with some empty columns suggesting that they may not be relevant to the context of the table. The values in each column seem to follow a specific pattern or relationship, but without more information, it is difficult to determine their exact meaning or purpose.  \n\nAs noted above, 23 sets of variables $a,\\,b$ ,and $c$ satisfy the requirement.

The graph's axes are labeled as follows:\n\n*   **Y-axis (Output):** A numerical scale ranging from 0 to 1.4, incrementing by 0.2.\n*   **X-axis (t sec):** A time axis marked in increments of 0.5 seconds, spanning from 0 to 4 seconds.\n\nThe graph's curve exhibits a smooth, continuous shape, characterized by the following features:\n\n*   **Initial Segment:** The curve begins at approximately (0, 1) and rises to its peak value within the first second.\n*   **Peak Value:** The curve reaches its highest point at around (0.5, 1.2), followed by a gradual decline.\n*   **Middle Segment:** Between approximately 1-3 seconds, the curve maintains a relatively stable output level, oscillating between 0.8 and 1.0.\n*   **Final Segment:** As time approaches 4 seconds, the curve begins to decrease more rapidly, eventually returning to its starting value of around (4, 1).\n\nOverall, the graph illustrates a dynamic process with an initial increase, followed by stabilization, and ultimately, a return to the starting point.  \nResponse to Unit-Step Disturbance Input  \n\n# Figure 8–35  \n\n(a) Response to unitstep reference input $(a=4.2,b=2,c=12)$ ;(b) response to unit-step disturbance input $(a=4.2,b=2,c=12)$ ).  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a title that reads \"Response to Unit Step Disturbance Input.\" The graph features a single curve, which is black and appears as if it was drawn by hand. It exhibits a bell-shaped pattern, characterized by:\n\n*   **Initial increase**: The curve starts at the bottom left of the graph, increases sharply, and reaches its peak.\n*   **Peak value**: At approximately 0.5 seconds on the x-axis, the curve reaches its maximum value.\n*   **Decline**: Following the peak, the curve declines steadily until it reaches zero.\n\n**Graph Details**\n\nThe graph has the following characteristics:\n\n*   **X-axis**: Labeled as \"t (sec)\", indicating time in seconds.\n*   **Y-axis**: Labeled as \"Output\", with values ranging from -0.01 to 0.07.\n*   **Title**: \"Response to Unit Step Disturbance Input\".\n\n**Additional Features**\n\nThe graph includes:\n\n*   A grid pattern, likely added for visual clarity or to facilitate data analysis.\n*   No additional features, such as labels or annotations.\n\nOverall, the graph appears to be a simple yet effective visualization of a response to a unit step disturbance input.  \n\nBy equating the coefficients of equal powers of $s$ on both sides of this last equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{1+10K=20.4}}\\\\ {{10K(\\alpha+\\beta)=122.44}}\\\\ {{10K\\alpha\\beta=259.68}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\nK=1.94,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\alpha+\\beta=\\frac{122.44}{19.4},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\alpha\\beta=\\frac{259.68}{19.4}\n$$  \n\nThen $G_{c}(s)$ can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{G_{c}(s)=K\\,{\\frac{(s\\,+\\,\\alpha)(s\\,+\\,\\beta)}{s}}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\frac{K\\left[s^{2}\\,+\\,(\\alpha\\,+\\,\\beta)s\\,+\\,\\alpha\\beta\\right]}{s}}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\frac{1.94s^{2}\\,+\\,12.244s\\,+\\,25.968}{s}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/D(s)$ becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}}={\\frac{10}{s(s+1)+10G_{c}}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{\\qquad={\\frac{10}{s(s+1)+10\\,{\\frac{1.94s^{2}+12.244s+25.968}{s}}}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nUsing this expression, the response $y(t)$ to a unit-step disturbance input can be obtained as shown in Figure 8–35(b).  \n\nFigure 8–36(a) shows the response of the system to the unit-step reference input when $a,b$ ,and $c$ are chosen as  \n\n$$\na\\,=\\,3.2,\\qquad b\\,=\\,2,\\qquad c\\,=\\,12\n$$  \n\nFigure 8–36(b) shows the response of this system when it is subjected to a unit-step disturbance input. Comparing Figures 8–35(a) and Figure 8–36(a), we find that they are about the same. However, comparing Figures 8–35(b) and 8–36(b), we find the former to be a little bit better than the latter.

The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top section contains input and output blocks, while the bottom section consists of processing units.\n\n**Top Section: Input and Output Blocks**\n\n*   **Input Block (R(s))**: This block represents the input signal to the system.\n*   **Output Block (Y(s))**: This block represents the output signal from the system.\n*   **Gain Block (Gc1(s))**: This block applies a gain to the input signal, represented by the transfer function 2.04s + 12.244 + 25.968/s.\n\n**Bottom Section: Processing Units**\n\n*   **Delay Block (D(s))**: This block introduces a delay in the system, represented by the transfer function s-1.\n*   **Gain Block (Gc2(s))**: This block applies another gain to the output signal, represented by the transfer function 0.1s.\n\n**Interconnections and Feedback Loop**\n\nThe input block is connected to the gain block Gc1(s), which in turn feeds into the delay block D(s). The output of the delay block is fed back to the gain block Gc2(s), creating a feedback loop. The output of the gain block Gc2(s) is then sent to the output block Y(s).\n\n**Overall System Behavior**\n\nThe system's behavior can be understood by analyzing the transfer functions associated with each block. The overall transfer function of the system is the product of the individual transfer functions:\n\nG(s) = Gc1(s) \\* D(s) \\* Gc2(s)\n\nBy substituting the given transfer functions, we obtain:\n\nG(s) = (2.04s + 12.244 + 25.968/s) \\* s-1 \\* 0.1s\n\nThis represents the system's response to an input signal R(s). The presence of a delay in the feedback loop introduces a phase shift in the system's response, which can affect its stability and performance.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a complex system with multiple components and interconnections, including gain blocks, delay blocks, and a feedback loop. Understanding the transfer functions associated with each block enables us to analyze the system's behavior and potential limitations.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive comparison of two distinct response types: Unit-Ramp Response and Unit-Acceleration Response. The plot is divided into two sections, each featuring an x-y graph with a linear axis on both sides.\n\n**Unit-Ramp Response**\n\n*   **Graph Description**\n    *   The top section displays a unit-ramp response, characterized by a straight line with a positive slope.\n    *   The x-axis represents time in seconds (t), ranging from 0 to 2.5 seconds.\n    *   The y-axis represents the output value, also ranging from 0 to 2.5 units.\n    *   A unit-ramp input is applied at t=0, resulting in a linear increase in the output over time.\n*   **Key Features**\n    *   The graph shows a consistent and predictable relationship between the input and output values.\n    *   The slope of the line indicates that the system responds proportionally to the input.\n\n**Unit-Acceleration Response**\n\n*   **Graph Description**\n    *   The bottom section displays a unit-acceleration response, characterized by an exponential curve with a positive gradient.\n    *   The x-axis represents time in seconds (t), ranging from 0 to 2.5 seconds.\n    *   The y-axis represents the output value, also ranging from 0 to 2.5 units.\n    *   A unit-acceleration input is applied at t=0, resulting in an exponential increase in the output over time.\n*   **Key Features**\n    *   The graph shows a non-linear relationship between the input and output values.\n    *   The curve indicates that the system responds rapidly to changes in the input.\n\nIn summary, the image effectively illustrates the differences between unit-ramp response and unit-acceleration response. The top section demonstrates a linear relationship between the input and output values, while the bottom section shows an exponential increase in the output over time. This visual representation highlights the distinct characteristics of each response type, providing valuable insights for analysis and comparison purposes. 8–38 (a) Response to unitramp reference input; (b) response to unit-acceleration reference input.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 8–5  \n\nThe response to the unit-ramp reference input and that to the unit-acceleration reference input are shown in Figures 8–38(a) and (b), respectively.The steady-state errors in following the ramp input and acceleration input are zero. Thus, all the requirements of the problem are satisfied. Hence, the designed controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ are acceptable.  \n\nConsider the control system shown in Figure 8–39. This is a two-degrees-of-freedom system.In the design problem considered here, we assume that the noise input $N(s)$ is zero. Assume that the plant transfer function $G_{p}(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nG_{p}(s)={\\frac{5}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,5)}}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, comprising multiple interconnected blocks that represent various components and processes involved in the system's operation.\n\n**Components**\n\n*   **R(s)**: This block represents the reference input signal to the system, which is likely used as a target or desired output.\n*   **Gc2(s)**: The controller transfer function, responsible for determining how the system responds to changes in its inputs. It processes the error between the reference and actual outputs to produce an appropriate control action.\n*   **B(s)**: This block symbolizes the plant dynamics, representing the physical system being controlled. Its output is influenced by both the input from Gc2(s) and any disturbances or noise present in the environment.\n*   **U(s)**: The control signal generated by the controller, which is applied to the plant to achieve the desired behavior.\n*   **D(s)**: An external disturbance affecting the system's dynamics. This could be a random fluctuation or an unpredictable input that impacts the overall performance of the system.\n\n**Connections**\n\nThe blocks are interconnected through various paths, illustrating how signals flow between them:\n\n*   The reference signal R(s) is subtracted from the plant output B(s), resulting in an error signal.\n*   This error signal is fed into Gc2(s), which calculates the appropriate control action U(s).\n*   The control signal U(s) is then applied to the plant input, influencing its dynamics and attempting to minimize the error between the reference and actual outputs.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n*   The system incorporates feedback mechanisms, where the output of the plant is compared with the desired input (reference), enabling adjustments based on any discrepancies.\n*   External disturbances D(s) can impact the performance of the system, necessitating robust control strategies to mitigate their effects effectively.\n\nIn summary, this block diagram illustrates a basic structure for a control system that includes elements such as reference inputs, plant dynamics, controllers, and external disturbances. It highlights the importance of feedback loops in achieving desired system behaviors amidst varying conditions. 8–39 Two-degrees-offreedom control system.  \n\nAssume also that the controller $G_{c1}(s)$ is of PID type.That is,  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nThe controller $G_{c2}(s)$ is of $\\mathbf{P}$ or PD type. [If $G_{c2}(s)$ involves integral control action, then this will introduce a ramp component in the input signal, which is not desirable.Therefore, $G_{c2}(s)$ should not include the integral control action.] Thus, we assume that  \n\n$$\nG_{c2}(s)\\,=\\,\\hat{K}_{p}\\!\\big(1\\,+\\,\\hat{T}_{d}s\\big)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\hat{T}_{d}$ may be zero.  \n\nLet us design controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ such that the responses to the step-disturbance input and the step-reference input are of “desirable characteristics” in the sense that  \n\n1. The response to the step-disturbance input will have a small peak and eventually approach zero. (That is, there will be no steady-state error.)   \n2. The response to the step reference input will exhibit less than $25\\%$ overshoot with a settling time less than 2 sec.The steady-state errors to the ramp reference input and acceleration reference input should be zero.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a signal flow system, comprising multiple components and arrows that illustrate the flow of signals between them. The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a distinct component or stage in the process.\n\n*   **Input Signal**\n    *   The input signal is represented by an arrow labeled \"D(s)\" entering the top-left corner of the diagram.\n    *   This signal is processed by subsequent components before being output.\n*   **Filter Component**\n    *   Below the input signal, a filter component is denoted as Gp(s).\n    *   This component processes the input signal and produces an output that flows to the right.\n*   **Feedback Loop**\n    *   The output of the filter component flows into a feedback loop, represented by an arrow leading back to the top-left corner of the diagram.\n    *   Within this loop, another component is labeled Gc1(s), which further processes the signal before it returns to the initial stage.\n*   **Output Signal**\n    *   The final output signal emerges from the bottom-right corner of the diagram and is labeled Y(s).\n    *   This signal represents the processed input after being filtered through all components in the system.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a signal flow process involving an input signal, two filter components (Gp(s) and Gc1(s)), and a feedback loop. The output signal, Y(s), is derived from these components' collective processing of the input signal D(s). 8–40 Control system.  \n\nThe design of this two-degrees-of-freedom control system may be carried out by following the steps 1 and 2 below.  \n\n1. Determine $G_{c1}(s)$ so that the response to the step-disturbance input is of desirable characteristics. 2. Design $G_{c2}(s)$ so that the responses to the reference inputs are of desirable characteristics without changing the response to the step disturbance considered in step 1 .  \n\nDesign of $G_{c1}(s)$ :First, note that we assumed the noise input $N(s)$ to be zero.To obtain the response to the step-disturbance input, we assume that the reference input is zero. Then the block diagram which relates $Y(s)$ and $D(s)$ can be drawn as shown in Figure 8–40. The transfer function $Y(s)/D(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}}{1+G_{c1}G_{p}}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}+\\,T_{d}s\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nThis controller involves one pole at the origin and two zeros. If we assume that the two zeros are located at the same place (a double zero), then $G_{c1}(s)$ can be written as  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}(s)\\,=\\,K\\,\\frac{(s\\,+\\,a)^{2}}{s}\n$$  \n\nThen the characteristic equation for the system becomes  \n\n$$\n1\\,+\\,G_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)\\,=\\,1\\,+\\,{\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,a)^{2}}{s}}{\\frac{5}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,5)}}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\ns(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,5)\\,+\\,5K(s\\,+\\,a)^{2}=0\n$$  \n\nwhich can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,(6\\,+\\,5K)s^{2}\\,+\\,(5\\,+\\,10K a)s\\,+\\,5K a^{2}=0\n$$  \n\nIf we place the double zero between $s=-3$ and $s=-6$ ,then the root-locus plot of $G_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)$ may look like the one shown in Figure 8–41. The speed of response should be fast, but not faster than necessary, because faster response generally implies larger or more expensive components. Therefore, we may choose the dominant closed-loop poles at  \n\n$$\ns=-3\\,\\pm\\,j2\n$$  \n\n(Note that this choice is not unique.There are infinitely many possible closed-loop poles that we may choose from.)  \n\nSince the system is of third order, there are three closed-loop poles.

In contrast, the output line displays a similar exponential growth trend but with a slightly lower magnitude than the input. At t=0 seconds, the output value is roughly 0.4, and it reaches approximately 1.6 by t=2 seconds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph effectively illustrates the impulse response of a system or process, where the input and output values are closely related yet distinct in their growth patterns. The input exhibits a more rapid increase than the output, suggesting potential differences in how the system responds to changes over time. Overall, the graph provides valuable insights into the behavior of the system under examination.  \n(c)  \n\nFigure 8–43 (continued)  \n\nThe response exhibits the maximum overshoot of $21\\%$ and the settling time is approximately 1.6 sec. Figures 8–43(b) and (c) show the ramp response and acceleration response. The steadystate errors in both responses are zero.The response to the step disturbance was satisfactory.Thus, the designed controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ given by Equations (8–12) and (8–13), respectively, are satisfactory.  \n\nIf the response characteristics to the unit-step reference input are not satisfactory, we need to change the location of the dominant closed-loop poles and repeat the design process.The dominant closed-loop poles should lie in a certain region in the left-half $s$ plane (such as $2\\le a\\le6$ ,$2\\leq b\\leq6,6\\leq c\\leq12)$ . If the computational search is desired, write a computer program (similar to MATLAB Program 8–8) and execute the search process.Then a desired set or sets of values of $a,\\,b$ ,and $c$ may be found such that the system response to the unit-step reference input satisfies all requirements on maximum overshoot and settling time.  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–8–1. Describe briefly the dynamic characteristics of the PI controller, PD controller, and PID controller.  \n\nSolution. The PI controller is characterized by the transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}\\bigg(1\\,+\\frac{1}{T_{i}s}\\bigg)\n$$  \n\nThe PI controller is a lag compensator. It possesses a zero at $s=-1/T_{i}$ and a pole at $s\\,=\\,0.$ .Thus, the characteristic of the PI controller is infinite gain at zero frequency. This improves the steady-state characteristics. However, inclusion of the PI control action in the system increases the type number of the compensated system by 1, and this causes the compensated system to be less stable or even makes the system unstable.Therefore, the values of $K_{p}$ and $T_{i}$ must be chosen carefully to ensure a proper transient response. By properly designing the PI controller, it is possible to make the transient response to a step input exhibit relatively small or no overshoot.The speed of response, however, becomes much slower. This is because the PI controller, being a low-pass filter, attenuates the high-frequency components of the signal.  \n\nThe PD controller is a simplified version of the lead compensator.The PD controller has the transfer function $G_{c}(s)$ ,where  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,K_{p}(1\\,+\\,T_{d}s)\n$$  \n\nThe value of $K_{p}$ is usually determined to satisfy the steady-state requirement. The corner frequency $1/T_{d}$ is chosen such that the phase lead occurs in the neighborhood of the gain crossover frequency. Although the phase margin can be increased, the magnitude of the compensator continues to increase for the frequency region $1/T_{d}<\\omega$ .(Thus, the PD controller is a high-pass filter.) Such a continued increase of the magnitude is undesirable, since it amplifies high-frequency noises that may be present in the system. Lead compensation can provide a sufficient phase lead, while the increase of the magnitude for the high-frequency region is very much smaller than that for PD control. Therefore, lead compensation is preferred over PD control.  \n\nBecause the transfer function of the PD controller involves one zero, but no pole, it is not possible to electrically realize it by passive $R L C$ elements only. Realization of the PD controller using op amps, resistors, and capacitors is possible, but because the PD controller is a high-pass filter, as mentioned earlier, the differentiation process involved may cause serious noise problems in some cases.There is,however,no problem if the PD controller is realized by use of the hydraulic or pneumatic elements.  \n\nThe PD control, as in the case of the lead compensator, improves the transient-response characteristics, improves system stability, and increases the system bandwidth, which implies fast rise time.  \n\nThe PID controller is a combination of the PI and PD controllers.It is a lag–lead compensator. Note that the PI control action and PD control action occur in different frequency regions. The PI control action occurs at the low-frequency region and PD control action occurs at the highfrequency region.The PID control may be used when the system requires improvements in both transient and steady-state performances.  \n\nShow that the transfer function $U(s)/E(s)$ of the PID controller shown in Figure 8–44 is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}=\\,K_{0}\\,\\frac{T_{1}\\,+\\,T_{2}}{T_{1}}\\left[1\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{\\left(T_{1}\\,+\\,T_{2}\\right)\\!s}+\\frac{T_{1}T_{2}s}{T_{1}\\,+\\,T_{2}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nAssume that the gain $K$ is very large compared with unity, or $K\\gg1$ .  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, featuring various components and variables.

The upper circuit features resistors $R_1$ and $R_3$, capacitors $C_1$ and $C_2$, and an input voltage source. Conversely, the lower circuit consists of resistor $R_4$, capacitor $C_3$, and an output voltage source.\n\nThe op-amp is situated at the centre of both circuits, with its inputs on the left-hand side and outputs on the right-hand side. The top-left corner displays the equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{E_o(s)}{E_i(s)} = \\frac{\\frac{R_3}{C_1}}{R_2 + R_4} \n$$\n\nwhere $E_o(s)$ denotes the output voltage and $E_i(s)$ represents the input voltage.\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n* The circuit is designed to amplify or attenuate signals based on the values of resistors $R_3$, $C_1$, and capacitors $C_2$.\n* The op-amp acts as an amplifier, multiplying the input signal by a factor determined by the ratio of resistances and capacitances.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, the circuit diagram illustrates a basic operational amplifier (op-amp) circuit with both amplification and filtering capabilities. By adjusting the values of resistors $R_3$, $C_1$, and capacitors $C_2$, the circuit can be tailored to suit specific applications in electronics engineering. 8–45 Modified PID controller.  \n\nThis image depicts a block diagram for a control system, with various components and symbols used to represent different elements of the system.\n\n*   **Input (R(s))**: The input signal is represented by a circle with an arrow pointing towards it. This represents the reference or desired output of the system.\n*   **Controller (1/γ)**: The controller is denoted by the symbol \"1/γ\", which represents a gain or scaling factor applied to the error signal. This component adjusts the input signal based on the system's performance and feedback.\n*   **Plant (C(s))**: The plant is represented by the symbol \"C(s)\", which denotes a transfer function that describes how the system responds to changes in its inputs. In this case, the plant is likely a continuous-time system, as indicated by the presence of \"s\" in the transfer function.\n*   **Output (Y)**: The output signal is not explicitly labeled but can be inferred from the context. It represents the result or response of the system to the input and control signals.\n\nThe block diagram shows how the components interact with each other, with the controller adjusting the input signal based on feedback from the plant, which in turn affects the output signal. The use of \"s\" in the transfer functions suggests that this is a continuous-time system, as opposed to a discrete-time system where the variable would be \"z\".\n\nOverall, this block diagram provides a visual representation of the control system's architecture and how its components interact with each other to achieve a desired outcome. 8–46 Approximate differentiator.  \n\nConsequently,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\frac{E_{o}(s)}{E(s)}\\frac{E(s)}{E_{i}(s)}=\\frac{R_{s}}{R_{4}(R_{1}+R_{3})C_{2}}\\frac{\\big(R_{1}C_{1}s\\,+1\\big)\\big(R_{2}C_{2}s\\,+1\\big)}{s\\Big(\\frac{R_{1}R_{3}}{R_{1}+R_{3}}C_{1}s\\,+1\\Big)}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{R_{s}R_{2}}{R_{4}R_{3}}\\frac{\\left(s+\\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{1}}\\right)\\left(s+\\frac{1}{R_{2}C_{2}}\\right)}{s\\left(s+\\frac{R_{1}+R_{3}}{R_{1}R_{3}C_{1}}\\right)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNotice that $R_{1}C_{1}$ and $R_{2}C_{2}$ determine the locations of the zeros of the controller, while $R_{1},R_{3}$ ,and $C_{1}$ affect the location of the pole on the negative real axis. ${R}_{5}/{R}_{4}$ adjusts the gain of the controller.  \n\nA–8–4. In practice, it is impossible to realize the true differentiator. Hence, we always have to approximate the true differentiator $T_{d}s$ by something like  \n\n$$\n\\frac{T_{d}s}{1\\,+\\,\\gamma T_{d}s}\n$$  \n\nOne way to realize such an approximate differentiator is to utilize an integrator in the feedback path. Show that the closed-loop transfer function of the system shown in Figure 8–46 is given by the preceding expression. (In the commercially available differentiator, the value of $\\gamma$ may be set as 0.1.)  \n\nSolution. The closed-loop transfer function of the system shown in Figure 8–46 is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}}{1+{\\frac{1}{\\gamma T_{d}s}}}}={\\frac{T_{d}s}{1\\,+\\,{\\gamma T_{d}s}}}\n$$  \n\nNote that such a differentiator with first-order delay reduces the bandwidth of the closed-loop control system and reduces the detrimental effect of noise signals.  \n\nA–8–5. Consider the system shown in Figure 8–47. This is a PID control of a second-order plant $G(s)$ .Assume that disturbances $D(s)$ enter the system as shown in the diagram. It is assumed that the reference input $R(s)$ is normally held constant, and the response characteristics to disturbances are a very important consideration in this system.  \n\nFigure 8–47 PID-controlled system.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, which is a graphical representation of the components and their interconnections in a control system. The diagram shows the following elements:\n\n*   **PID Controller**: A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is used to regulate the output of the system.\n    *   It has three terms:\n        *   Proportional term: This term is proportional to the error between the setpoint and the actual output.\n        *   Integral term: This term is proportional to the accumulation of past errors.\n        *   Derivative term: This term is proportional to the rate of change of the output with respect to time.\n*   **Plant**: The plant represents the process being controlled, which in this case is a first-order system with a transfer function given by $G(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 3.6s + 9}$.\n    *   The plant has two poles at $s = -1.8$ and $s = -5$, indicating that it is a stable system.\n*   **Reference Input**: The reference input represents the desired output of the system, which is set to $r(s) = 0$ in this case.\n\nThe diagram also shows the feedback loop, where the output of the plant is fed back to the PID controller. The PID controller calculates the error between the reference input and the actual output, and then adjusts the control signal accordingly.\n\nOverall, the block diagram represents a classic control system with a PID controller regulating a first-order plant. The system is designed to track a setpoint of zero, and the feedback loop ensures that the output converges to this value over time.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n*   **PID Controller**: A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is used to regulate the output of the system.\n    *   It has three terms:\n        *   Proportional term: This term is proportional to the error between the setpoint and the actual output.\n        *   Integral term: This term is proportional to the accumulation of past errors.\n        *   Derivative term: This term is proportional to the rate of change of the output with respect to time.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\nDesign a control system such that the response to any step disturbance will be damped out quickly (in 2 to 3 sec in terms of the $2\\%$ settling time). Choose the configuration of the closed-loop poles such that there is a pair of dominant closed-loop poles. Then obtain the response to the unit-step disturbance input.Also, obtain the response to the unit-step reference input.  \n\nSolution. The PID controller has the transfer function  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\frac{K(a s\\,+\\,1)(b s\\,+\\,1)}{s}\n$$  \n\nFor the disturbance input in the absence of the reference input, the closed-loop transfer function becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle\\frac{C_{d}(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{s}{s\\big(s^{2}+3.6s+9\\big)+K(a s+1)(b s+1)}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle=\\frac{s}{s^{3}+(3.6+K a b)s^{2}+(9+K a+K b)s+K}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe specification requires that the response to the unit-step disturbance be such that the settling time be 2 to 3 sec and the system have a reasonable damping.We may interpret the specification as $\\zeta=0.5$ and $\\omega_{n}=4$ rad 'sec for the dominant closed-loop poles.We may choose the third pole at $s=-10$ so that the effect of this real pole on the response is small. Then the desired characteristic equation can be written as  \n\n$$\n(s~+~10){\\left({{s^{2}}+2\\times0.5\\times4s+4^{2}}\\right)}=(s~+~10){\\left({{s^{2}}+4s+16}\\right)}=s^{3}+~14s^{2}+56s~+~16s^{3}+~257s^{2}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation for the system given by Equation (8–14) is  \n\n$$\ns^{3}\\,+\\,(3.6\\,+\\,K a b)s^{2}\\,+\\,(9\\,+\\,K a\\,+\\,K b)s\\,+\\,K\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nHence, we require  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{3.6\\,+\\,K a b\\,=\\,14}\\\\ {9\\,+\\,K a\\,+\\,K b\\,=\\,56}\\\\ {K=\\,160}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhich yields  \n\n$$\na b=0.065,~~~~~a+b=0.29375\n$$  \n\nThe PID controller now becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{G_{c}(s)=\\frac{K\\left[a b s^{2}\\,+\\,\\left(a\\,+\\,b\\right)s\\,+\\,1\\right]}{s}}\\\\ {~~}&{=\\frac{160\\left(0.065s^{2}\\,+\\,0.29375s\\,+\\,1\\right)}{s}}\\\\ {~~}&{=\\frac{10.4\\left(s^{2}\\,+\\,4.5192s\\,+\\,15.385\\right)}{s}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWith this PID controller, the response to the disturbance is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{C_{d}(s)\\,=\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{s^{3}\\,+\\,14s^{2}\\,+\\,56s\\,+\\,160}\\,D(s)}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{s}{(s\\,+\\,10)\\big(s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,16\\big)}\\,D(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nClearly, for a unit-step disturbance input, the steady-state output is zero, since  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}c_{d}(t)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}s C_{d}(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{s\\rightarrow0}\\frac{s^{2}}{(s\\,+\\,10)\\bigl(s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,16\\bigr)}\\frac{1}{s}=0\n$$  \n\nThe response to a unit-step disturbance input can be obtained easily with MATLAB. MATLAB Program 8–9 produces a response curve as shown in Figure 8–48(a). From the response curve, we see that the settling time is approximately 2.7 sec.The response damps out quickly.Therefore, the system designed here is acceptable.  \n\nThe image presents a screenshot of an Emacs editor window displaying MATLAB code, with the title \"MATLAB Program 8-9\" at the top.

The key elements of this diagram are:\n\n*   **PID Controller**\n    *   This controller receives an error signal and applies it to a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm.\n    *   It outputs a control action that is proportional to the current error, integral over time, and derivative of the current error.\n    *   The PID controller is represented by the equation K*(s+a)/(s+b), where K is the gain, s represents the Laplace variable, and a and b are constants defining the proportional and integral/differential components, respectively.\n*   **Plant**\n    *   This component represents the system being controlled, which can be any physical process or system.\n    *   It is modeled as a transfer function G(s), indicating how it responds to input signals in terms of its output.\n*   **Reference Input (R(s))**\n    *   This signal represents the desired setpoint or target value for the plant's output.\n    *   It serves as the input to the system, driving the controller to adjust its output accordingly.\n*   **Error Signal (e(s))**\n    *   This is the difference between the actual output of the plant and its desired reference input.\n    *   The error signal is fed into the PID controller, which uses it to compute a control action that minimizes this difference.\n*   **Control Output (u(s))**\n    *   This is the result of applying the PID algorithm to the error signal.\n    *   It represents the commanded output from the controller intended to bring the plant's actual output closer to its desired value.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a basic control system structure involving a PID controller, a plant, and reference input. The PID controller takes the difference between the desired output (from the reference input) and the actual output of the plant as its error signal, calculates a corrective action based on this error, and applies it to the plant through the control output. This process aims to stabilize the system and track the desired setpoint effectively.  \n\nthe sum of the angles at $s=-1\\,+\\,j{\\sqrt{3}}$ ,one of the desired closed-loop poles, from the zero at $s=-1$ and poles at $s\\,=\\,0,s\\,=\\,j$ ,and $s=-j$ is  \n\n$$\n90^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~-~}143.794^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~-~}120^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~-~}110.104^{\\circ}\\mathrm{~=~}-283.898^{\\circ}\n$$  \n\nHence the zero at $s=-b$ must contribute $103.898^{\\circ}$ .This requires that the zero be located at  \n\n$$\nb=0.5714\n$$  \n\nThe gain constant $K$ can be determined from the magnitude condition.  \n\n$$\n\\left|K\\,{\\frac{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,0.5714)}{s}}{\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,1}}\\right|_{s=-1+j\\sqrt3}=1\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\nK\\,=\\,2.3333\n$$  \n\nThen the compensator can be written as follows:  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)\\,=\\,2.3333\\,{\\frac{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,0.5714)}{s}}\n$$  \n\nThe open-loop transfer function becomes  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)G(s)\\,=\\frac{2.3333(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,0.5714)}{s}\\frac{1}{s^{2}\\,+\\,1}\n$$  \n\nFrom this equation a root-locus plot for the compensated system can be drawn. Figure 8–50 is a root-locus plot.  \n\nThe image shows a root-locus plot of a system with two poles, which is used to analyze the stability and behavior of the system. The plot provides information about the location of the poles in the complex plane.\n\n*   **Title**: Root-Locus Plot of Gc(s)G(s)\n    *   The title indicates that the plot represents the root-locus of a transfer function Gc(s)G(s).\n*   **X-axis**: Imaginary Axis\n    *   The x-axis represents the imaginary part of the complex plane.\n*   **Y-axis**: Real Axis\n    *   The y-axis represents the real part of the complex plane.\n*   **Pole Locations**:\n    *   There are two poles located at -1 + j0.5 and -1 - j0.5.\n    *   Both poles have a negative real part, indicating that the system is stable.\n*   **Zero Locations**:\n    *   There are no zeros in the plot.\n*   **Gain Array**:\n    *   The gain array is not visible in the plot.\n*   **System Characteristics**:\n    *   The system has two poles, which means it is a second-order system.\n    *   The poles are located on the real axis, indicating that the system has no oscillatory behavior.\n\nIn summary, the root-locus plot shows that the system has two stable poles located at -1 + j0.5 and -1 - j0.5, with no zeros in the system. The gain array is not visible in the plot. Overall, the system appears to be stable and well-behaved. 8–50 Root-locus plot of the compensated system.   \nReal Axis  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with the x-axis labeled \"Time (sec)\" and the y-axis labeled \"Amplitude\".

The graph consists of several key elements:\n\n*   **Input**: A signal enters the system from the left side.\n*   **Gain Block**: A gain block with a coefficient of 0.1 is located next to the input. This block amplifies or attenuates the incoming signal according to its value.\n*   **Transfer Function**: The output of the gain block is fed into a transfer function, represented by the symbol G(s). This block implements a mathematical operation on the signal, which can be thought of as a filter that shapes the frequency response of the system.\n*   **Summing Junction**: The output of the transfer function is summed with another signal entering from the right side. The resulting sum is then fed into a final gain block.\n*   **Final Gain Block**: This block applies an additional scaling factor to the combined signal, represented by the coefficient s + 0.1/s^2 + 1.\n\nThe overall structure of this system can be interpreted as a feedback loop, where the output is fed back and summed with the input before being processed through another set of gains and filters. The mathematical representation of this graph would involve solving for the closed-loop transfer function, which describes how the input signal relates to the output signal over time.\n\nIn summary, the image illustrates a complex system dynamics using signal flow graphs, where each block represents a specific operation or transformation applied to the signal as it flows through the system.  \nChapter 8 /PID Controllers and Modified PID Controllers  \n\nThus, $K=40,$ . Hence  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=\\frac{40}{s}\\,\\hat{G}_{c}(s)\n$$  \n\nNext, we plot a Bode diagram of  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{40(s+0.1)}{s(s^{2}+1)}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 8–10 produces a Bode diagram of $G(s)$ as shown in Figure 8–53.  \n\nThe image displays a mathematical equation, specifically a Bode diagram for a transfer function. The title of the image is \"MATLAB Program 8-10\".\n\n*   The equation is written in LaTeX format and includes several mathematical symbols and variables.\n    *   The symbol \"%\" indicates that the line is a comment.\n    *   The variable \"G(s)\" represents the transfer function, which is a ratio of two polynomials in the complex variable s.\n    *   The expression \"40(s+0.1)/[s^2+1]\" represents the numerator and denominator of the transfer function.\n*   Below the equation, there are several lines of code that appear to be part of a MATLAB program.\n    *   The first line defines a function called \"num\" with three inputs: x, y, and z. However, this line is likely a mistake, as it does not seem related to the rest of the code or the equation above.\n    *   The second line defines another variable called \"den\" with two inputs: x and y. Again, this line may be incorrect or unnecessary.\n    *   The third line calls a function called \"bode\" with three inputs: num, den, and title. This suggests that the code is generating a Bode plot using MATLAB's built-in functions.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be a mathematical equation for a transfer function, accompanied by some potentially incorrect or unnecessary code. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the purpose of this image or how it relates to the surrounding text.  \n\nWe need the phase margin of $50^{\\circ}$ and gain margin of $10\\;\\mathrm{dB}$ or more. Let us choose $\\hat{G}_{c}(s)$ to be  \n\n$$\n\\hat{G}_{c}(s)\\,=\\,a s\\,+\\,1\\;\\;\\;\\;(a>0)\n$$  \n\nThen $G_{c}(s)$ will contribute up to $90^{\\circ}$ phase lead in the high-frequency region.By simple MATLAB trials, we find that $a\\,=\\,0.1526$ gives the phase margin of $50^{\\circ}$ and gain margin of $+\\infty$ dB.  \n\nThe image presents a Bode Diagram of G(s) = 40(s + 0.1)/s^2 + 1, showcasing the magnitude and phase response of the system.\n\n*   **Bode Magnitude Plot**\n    *   The plot displays the magnitude of the frequency response in decibels (dB) versus the logarithm of the frequency in radians per second.\n    *   The magnitude starts at approximately -20 dB at a low frequency and decreases gradually as the frequency increases.\n    *   At around 1 rad/s, there is a peak in the magnitude response, reaching its maximum value of approximately 0 dB.\n    *   Beyond this point, the magnitude begins to decrease again, eventually approaching -40 dB at higher frequencies.\n*   **Bode Phase Plot**\n    *   The plot illustrates the phase angle in degrees versus the logarithm of the frequency in radians per second.\n    *   At low frequencies, the phase is approximately 0° and remains relatively constant until around 1 rad/s.\n    *   As the frequency increases beyond this point, the phase begins to decrease linearly, approaching -180° at higher frequencies.\n\nIn summary, the Bode Diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response characteristics of G(s) = 40(s + 0.1)/s^2 + 1, highlighting both its magnitude and phase behavior across various frequency ranges. 8–53 Bode diagram of $G(s)=$ $40(s\\,+\\,0.1)/[s(s^{2}\\,+\\,1)].$  \n\nSee MATLAB Program 8–11 and the resulting Bode diagram shown in Figure 8–54. From this Bode diagram we see that the static velocity error constant is $4\\,\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$ , phase margin is $50^{\\circ}$ and gain margin is +q dB.Therefore, the designed system satisfies all the requirements.  \n\nThe image displays a mathematical equation and its corresponding code in MATLAB.

Notice that the closed-loop pole at $s=-0.0975$ and the plant zero at $s=-0.1$ produce a long tail of small amplitude.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB code snippet for creating a unit step response. \n\n*   The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 8-12\" and it is written in black text at the top left corner.\n*   Below the title, there are several lines of code that define the variables and functions used in the program:\n    *   `% ===== Unit Step Response =====`\n    *   `num = [6.104 40.6104 4];`\n        *   This line defines a vector called \"num\" with three elements: 6.104, 40.6104, and 4.\n        *   The syntax is used to define the numerator of a transfer function in the z-domain.\n    *   `den = [1 6.104 41.6104];`\n        *   This line defines a vector called \"den\" with three elements: 1, 6.104, and 41.6104.\n        *   The syntax is used to define the denominator of a transfer function in the z-domain.\n    *   `t = 0:0.01:10;`\n        *   This line generates an array of time values from 0 to 10 with a step size of 0.01.\n        *   The syntax is used to create a range of values for plotting or other numerical operations.\n*   At the bottom right corner, there is a grid on which the unit step response will be plotted.\n\nIn summary, this MATLAB code snippet generates a unit step response by defining the numerator and denominator of a transfer function in the z-domain, generating an array of time values, and creating a grid for plotting.  \n\nThe image depicts a line graph with an amplitude scale on the y-axis and time (in seconds) on the x-axis. The title \"Step Response\" is displayed at the top of the chart, indicating that it represents the response to a step input. \n\n**Amplitude Scale:**\nThe vertical axis measures the amplitude from 0 to approximately 1.4 in increments of 0.2.\n\n**Time Scale:**\nThe horizontal axis is marked with numbers from 0 to 10 in seconds, representing time.\n\n**Line Graph:**\nA single line graph occupies most of the image space, tracing an irregular path through the data points. The curve starts at a low point near the origin and gradually rises before reaching its peak. It then falls back down, crossing the y-axis close to the end of the chart, before leveling out.\n\n**Background and Border:**\nThe background is plain white with no gridlines or shading; however, the axes are outlined in black. The line graph itself is rendered as a black continuous line against the white background. 8–55 Unit-step response of $C(s)/R(s)\\,=\\,(6.104s^{2}\\,+$ $40.6104s\\,+\\,4)/(s^{3}\\,+$ $6.104s^{2}\\,+\\,41.6104s\\,+\\,4)$ .  \n\nThe image presents a line graph titled \"Unit-Ramp Response,\" which displays the relationship between input and output values over time. The graph features two lines: one representing the input ramp function (in black) and another representing the unit-ramp response (also in black). A third line, labeled \"Output\" but identical to the input ramp function, is included for comparison purposes.\n\n**Graph Details**\n\n*   **Title:** Unit-Ramp Response\n*   **Axes:**\n    *   X-axis: Time (t) in seconds\n    *   Y-axis: Input and output values\n*   **Lines:**\n    *   Black line: Input ramp function\n    *   Dashed black line: Unit-ramp response\n    *   Solid black line: Output (identical to input ramp function)\n\n**Key Observations**\n\n*   The input ramp function starts at 0 seconds and increases linearly over time.\n*   The unit-ramp response follows the same pattern as the input ramp function but is shifted to the right by approximately half a cycle.\n*   The output line is identical to the input ramp function, indicating that there is no significant difference between the input and output values.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe graph illustrates the relationship between the input ramp function and the unit-ramp response over time. The results show that the unit-ramp response follows the same pattern as the input ramp function but is shifted slightly to the right. This suggests a minor delay or lag in the system's response, but overall, the output closely tracks the input values. 8–56 Unit-ramp response of $C(s)/R(s)=$ $^{\\left(6.104s^{2}\\right.+\\left.40.6104s\\right.+}$ $4)/(s^{3}\\,+\\,6.104s^{2}\\,+$ $41.6104s\\,+\\,4)$ .  \n\nMATLAB Program 8–13 produces the unit-ramp response curve of the designed system.

The code is well-structured and easy to read, with clear variable names and concise comments. There are no significant changes or comparisons to note in this single screenshot.  \n\nNyquist Plot. Earlier we found that the three closed-loop poles of the designed system are all in the left-half $s$ plane. Hence the designed system is stable. The purpose of plotting Nyquist diagram here is not to test the stability of the system, but to enhance our understanding of Nyquist stability analysis. For a complicated system, Nyquist plot will look complicated enough that it is not easy to count the number of encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point.  \n\nThe image shows two semi-circles with arrows on their right-hand sides, accompanied by mathematical notation. The purpose of this image is to illustrate a concept related to calculus or mathematics.\n\n* Two semi-circles:\n\t+ One semi-circle has its center at the origin (0, 0) and a radius of 1.\n\t+ The other semi-circle has its center at the point (1, 0) and a radius of 1/2.\n* Arrows on the right-hand side of each semi-circle:\n\t+ The arrows are pointing to the right, indicating direction or flow.\n\t+ The arrow on the first semi-circle is longer than the one on the second semi-circle.\n* Mathematical notation:\n\t+ The equation \"x^2 = 4\" is written above the first semi-circle.\n\t+ The equation \"y^2 = 1/4\" is written below the second semi-circle.\n\nThe image suggests that there are two different mathematical concepts being represented, possibly related to geometry or algebra. The use of arrows and notation implies a relationship between the two shapes and their equations. 8–57 (a) Modified Nyquist path in the $s$ plane; (b) Nyquist path in the $s_{1}$ plane.  \n\nBecause the designed system involves three open-loop poles on the $j w$ axis, the Nyquist diagram will look quite complicated as we will see in what follows: Define the open-loop transfer function of the designed system as $G(s)$ .Then  \n\n$$\nG(s)=G_{c}(s)\\frac{s+0.1}{s^{2}+1}=\\frac{6.104s^{2}+40.6104s\\,+\\,4}{s(s^{2}+1)}\n$$  \n\nLet us choose a modified Nyquist path in the $s$ plane as shown in Figure 8–57(a). The modified path encloses three open-loop poles $(s\\,=\\,0,\\,s\\,=\\,j1,\\,s\\,=\\,-j1)$ . Now define $s_{1}=s+\\sigma_{0}$ . Then, the Nyquist path in the $s_{1}$ plane becomes as shown in Figure 8–57(b).

The resulting Nyquist plot is shown in Figure 8–58.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program snippet, specifically designed to generate a Nyquist plot. The code is structured into several sections, each serving a distinct purpose in creating and customizing the graphical representation.\n\n*   **Title**: The title of the script reads \"MATLAB Program 8-14,\" providing context for the content that follows.\n*   **Nyquist Plot Generation**:\n    *   The first section includes two commands: `num = [6.104 40.48832 3.5945064];` and `den = [1 -0.03 1.0003 -0.010001];`.\n        *   These lines define the numerator and denominator polynomials for a transfer function, which is crucial in generating the Nyquist plot.\n    *   The next line, `num2 = num / 10;`, scales down the numerator polynomial by a factor of 10.\n        *   This adjustment affects the frequency response characteristics depicted on the Nyquist plot.\n*   **Customization and Plotting**:\n    *   Following these definitions, the code initializes an empty figure (`figure(1)`), creates a new set of axes within that figure (`axes('Position',[0.2 0.2 0.7 0.7])`), and specifies labels for both the x-axis (`'Frequency (rad/s)'`) and y-axis (`'Magnitude (dB)'`).\n        *   These actions customize the appearance and orientation of the axes within the figure.\n    *   The plot itself is generated using `nyquist(num2,den)`, producing a Nyquist plot based on the modified transfer function defined earlier.\n        *   This command generates the graphical representation intended for analysis or further manipulation.\n\nIn summary, this MATLAB script generates a customized Nyquist plot by defining and manipulating the transfer function's numerator and denominator polynomials. It includes features such as scaling adjustments and axis labeling to enhance clarity and relevance of the plotted data.  \n\nThis image presents two diagrams, a Nyquist diagram and a corresponding Argand diagram, both rendered in black lines against a white background.\n\nThe top half of the image features a Nyquist diagram, which is a polar plot used to analyze the stability of control systems. The x-axis represents real values ranging from -2500 to 1500, while the y-axis represents imaginary values ranging from -2500 to 1500. This provides a comprehensive view of complex numbers, allowing for the identification of their positions within the complex plane.\n\nThe bottom half of the image displays an Argand diagram, which is also used to represent and analyze complex numbers. The x-axis on this graph corresponds to real values, while the y-axis corresponds to imaginary values. Similar to its counterpart in the top half of the image, this plot offers a visual representation of complex numbers within the complex plane.\n\nBoth diagrams are depicted with black lines against a white background, creating a clear and easy-to-read visual representation of these mathematical concepts. 8–58 Nyquist plot.  \n\nFigure 8–59   \nRedrawn Nyquist plot.  \n\nUsing the Nyquist plot obtained here, it is not easy to determine the encirclements of the $-1+j0$ point by the Nyquist locus. Therefore, we need to redraw this Nyquist plot qualitatively to show the details near the $-1+j0$ point. Such a redrawn Nyquist diagram is shown in Figure 8–59.  \n\nFrom this diagram we find that the $-1+j0$ point is encircled counterclockwise three times. Hence, $N=-3$ . Since the open-loop transfer function has three poles in the right-half $s_{1}$ plane, we have $P=3.$ .Then, we have $Z=N\\,+\\,P=0.$ This means that there are no closed-loop poles in the right-half $s_{1}$ plane.The system is therefore stable.  \n\nA–8–8. Show that the I-PD-controlled system shown in Figure 8–60(a) is equivalent to the PID-controlled system with input filter shown in Figure 8–60(b).  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of a control system, comprising two distinct blocks labeled \"a\" and \"b\". Each block is accompanied by a set of equations that illustrate the relationships between various variables.\n\n**Block A:**\n\n*   The top-left corner features an equation with three variables: $R(s)$, $K_p$, and $\\frac{1}{T_i s + 1}$.\n*   Below this equation lies another one with two variables: $C(s)$ and $G(s)$.\n\n**Block B:**\n\n*   This block contains a single equation featuring four variables: $s$, $K_p$, $\\frac{1}{T_i s + 1}$, and $\\frac{1}{T_d s + 1}$.\n*   The bottom-right corner of the image displays an additional equation with three variables: $C(s)$, $G(s)$, and $\\frac{1}{T_d s + 1}$.\n\nThe image effectively conveys the relationships between these variables through a combination of text and visual elements. 8–60 (a) I-PD-controlled system; (b) PID-controlled system with input filter.  \n\nSolution.

The basic idea of the I-PD control is to avoid large control signals (which will cause a saturation phenomenon) within the system. By bringing the proportional and derivative control actions to the feedback path, it is possible to choose larger values for $K_{p}$ and $T_{d}$ than those possible by the PID control scheme.  \n\nCompare,qualitatively,the responses of the PID-controlled system and I-PD-controlled system to the disturbance input and to the reference input.  \n\nSolution. Consider first the response of the I-PD-controlled system to the disturbance input. Since, in the I-PD control of a plant, it is possible to select larger values for $K_{p}$ and $T_{d}$ than those of the PID-controlled case, the I-PD-controlled system will attenuate the effect of disturbance faster than the PID-controlled case.  \n\nNext, consider the response of the I-PD-controlled system to a reference input. Since the I-PD-controlled system is equivalent to the PID-controlled system with input filter (refer to Problem A–8–8 ),the PID-controlled system will have faster responses than the corresponding I-PD-controlled system, provided a saturation phenomenon does not occur in the PID-controlled system.  \n\nA–8–10. In some cases it is desirable to provide an input filter as shown in Figure 8–61(a). Notice that the input filter $G_{f}(s)$ is outside the loop. Therefore, it does not affect the stability of the closedloop portion of the system.An advantage of having the input filter is that the zeros of the closed-loop transfer function can be modified (canceled or replaced by other zeros) so that the closedloop response is acceptable.  \n\nShow that the configuration in Figure 8–61(a) can be modified to that shown in Figure 8–61(b), where $G_{d}(s)\\,=\\,\\bigl[G_{f}(s)\\,\\stackrel{\\leftarrow}{-}\\,1\\bigr]G_{c}(s).$ .The compensation structure shown in Figure 8–61(b) is sometimes called command compensation.  \n\nSolution. For the system of Figure 8–61(a), we have  \n\n$$\n\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=G_{f}(s)\\,\\frac{G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}\n$$  \n\nFor the system of Figure 8–61(b), we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{U(s)=G_{d}(s)R(s)\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)E(s)}}\\\\ {{E(s)=R(s)\\,-\\,C(s)}}\\\\ {{C(s)=G_{p}(s)U(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{C(s)\\,=\\,G_{p}(s)\\bigl\\{G_{d}(s)R(s)\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)\\bigl[R(s)\\,-\\,C(s)\\bigr]\\bigr\\}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{{\\displaystyle\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{\\bigl[G_{d}(s)\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)\\bigr]G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nBy substituting $G_{d}(s)\\,=\\,\\bigl[G_{f}(s)\\,-\\,1\\bigr]G_{c}(s)$ into Equation (8–16), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{\\big[G_{f}(s)G_{c}(s)\\,-\\,G_{c}(s)\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)\\big]G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}}\\\\ {\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,=\\,G_{f}(s)\\,\\frac{G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image shows a block diagram of two systems, labeled (a) and (b), with various blocks connected by arrows. The blocks are represented as rectangles with input and output signals flowing into and out of them.\n\nSystem (a):\n\n*   **R(s)**: This is the input signal to the system.\n*   **Gf(s)**: This is a filter block that processes the input signal R(s).\n*   **Pc(s)**: This is another filter block that further processes the output of Gf(s).\n*   **Gp(s)**: This is a final filter block that takes the output of Pc(s) as its input.\n*   **C(s)**: This is the output of the system.\n\nSystem (b):\n\n*   **R(s)**: This is the input signal to the system.\n*   **Ef(s)**: This is an error detection block that processes the difference between R(s) and C(s).\n*   **Gc(s)**: This is a filter block that takes the output of Ef(s) as its input.\n*   **U(s)**: This is an actuator block that takes the output of Gc(s) as its input.\n*   **C(s)**: This is the output of the system.\n\nIn both systems, the blocks are connected by arrows to indicate the flow of signals.

Hence, we have shown that the systems shown in Figures 8–61(a) and (b) are equivalent.  \n\nIt is noted that the system shown in Figure 8–61(b) has a feedforward controller $G_{d}(s)$ .In such a case, $G_{d}(s)$ does not affect the stability of the closed-loop portion of the system.  \n\nA–8–11. A closed-loop system has the characteristic that the closed-loop transfer function is nearly equal to the inverse of the feedback transfer function whenever the open-loop gain is much greater than unity.  \n\nThe open-loop characteristic may be modified by adding an internal feedback loop with a characteristic equal to the inverse of the desired open-loop characteristic. Suppose that a unity-feedback system has the open-loop transfer function  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{K}{(T_{1}s\\,+\\,1)(T_{2}s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nDetermine the transfer function $H(s)$ of the element in the internal feedback loop so that the inner loop becomes ineffective at both low and high frequencies.  \n\nSolution. Figure 8–62(a) shows the original system. Figure 8–62(b) shows the addition of the internal feedback loop around $G(s)$ .Since  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{C(s)}{E(s)}}={\\frac{G(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}}={\\frac{1}{H(s)}}{\\frac{G(s)H(s)}{1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)}}\n$$  \n\nif the gain around the inner loop is large compared with unity, then $G(s)H(s)/[1\\,+\\,G(s)H(s)]$ CDis approximately equal to unity,and the transfer function $C(s)/E(s)$ is approximately equal to $1/H(s)$ .On the other hand, if the gain $\\left|G(s)H(s)\\right|$ is much less than unity, the inner loop becomes ineffective and $C(s)/E(s)$ becomes approximately equal to $G(s)$ .  \n\nTo make the inner loop ineffective at both the low- and high-frequency ranges, we require that  \n\n$$\n|G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)|\\,\\ll\\,1,\\;\\;\\;\\mathrm{for}\\;\\omega\\,\\ll\\,1\\;\\mathrm{and}\\;\\omega\\,\\gg\\,1\n$$  \n\nSince, in this problem,  \n\n$$\nG(j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{K}{(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{1})(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{2})}\n$$  \n\nFigure 8–62 (a) Control system; (b) addition of the internal feedback loop to modify the closed-loop characteristic.  \n\nThe image presents a series of flowcharts, likely illustrating a process or system. The charts are divided into three sections, each with its own set of symbols and arrows.\n\n*   **Section 1:**\n    *   This section features two boxes labeled \"G(s)\" and \"H(s)\". Arrows connect these boxes to another box labeled \"C\", indicating the flow of information.\n    *   A plus sign (+) is placed between the two input boxes, suggesting addition or combination of inputs.\n    *   An arrow points from the output box \"C\" back to one of the input boxes, possibly representing feedback or iteration.\n*   **Section 2:**\n    *   This section includes a single box labeled \"G(s)\" and an arrow pointing to it from another box with no label.\n    *   A plus sign (+) is located at the top of this box, indicating addition or combination of inputs.\n    *   An arrow points out of the \"G(s)\" box, possibly representing output or forward flow.\n*   **Section 3:**\n    *   This section consists of three boxes labeled \"G(s)\", \"H(s)\", and \"GH(s)\". Arrows connect these boxes in a circular pattern, suggesting iteration or feedback.\n    *   A plus sign (+) is placed between the first two input boxes, indicating addition or combination of inputs.\n    *   An arrow points from the third box back to one of the input boxes, possibly representing feedback or iteration.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a series of flowcharts illustrating processes involving variables G(s), H(s), and C. The charts show the flow of information between these variables, including addition, combination, and feedback loops.  \n\nthe requirement can be satisfied if $H(s)$ is chosen to be  \n\n$$\nH(s)=k s\n$$  \n\nbecause  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to0}G(j\\omega)H(j\\omega)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\omega\\to0}\\frac{K k j\\omega}{\\big(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{1}\\big)\\big(1\\,+\\,j\\omega T_{2}\\big)}=0\n$$  \n\nThus, with $H(s)\\,=\\,k s$ (velocity feedback), the inner loop becomes ineffective at both the lowand high-frequency regions. It becomes effective only in the intermediate-frequency region.  \n\nA–8–12. Consider the control system shown in Figure 8–63.

The diagram is structured as follows:\n\n*   **Input Signal (R(s))**: This represents the external command or reference signal that drives the system.\n    *   It is denoted by the variable R(s) and is connected to the input of the controller block Gc(s).\n*   **Controller Block (Gc(s))**: This block represents the controller's transfer function, which processes the error between the desired output and the actual output of the plant.\n    *   The controller takes in the error signal (the difference between R(s) and C(s)) and generates a control effort to drive the system towards its desired state.\n*   **Plant Block (C(s))**: This block represents the dynamic behavior of the system being controlled, including any inherent dynamics or delays.\n    *   The plant is affected by both the input signal R(s) and the controller's output Gc(s).\n*   **Transfer Function**: The transfer function for each block is represented in terms of Laplace transforms (s), which allows for the analysis of continuous-time systems using algebraic methods.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a basic control loop where an external command R(s) is processed by a controller Gc(s) to generate a suitable control effort. This control effort then acts on the plant C(s) to achieve the desired system behavior. The use of Laplace transforms enables the analysis and design of continuous-time systems within the frequency domain, facilitating the evaluation of system performance and stability characteristics.  \n\nFigure 8–63 Control system.  \n\nuse two ‘for’ loops.

The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis represents output values ranging from 0 to 1.4.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   Two curves are displayed on the graph.\n    *   Curve 1 is labeled as K = 29 and a = 0.25.\n    *   Curve 2 is labeled as K = 27 and a = 0.2.\n*   The curves exhibit an upward trend, indicating an increase in output over time.\n*   Both curves converge towards the end of the time period, suggesting that they reach similar output values after approximately 4 seconds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph illustrates the unit-step response of two systems with different gain (K) and damping ratio (a) values. The results show that both systems exhibit a similar behavior over time, with the output increasing rapidly initially before slowing down as it approaches its maximum value. 8–65 Unit-step response curves.  \n\nFrom the sorttable, it seems that  \n\n$K=29$ ,$a=0.25$ (max overshoot $=9.52\\%$ , settling time $=1.78$ sec)  \n\nand  \n\n# A–8–13.  \n\nare two of the best choices.The unit-step response curves for these two cases are shown in Figure 8–65. From these curves,we might conclude that the best choice depends on the system objective.If a small maximum overshoot is desired, $K=27,a=0.2$ will be the best choice.If the shorter settling time is more important than a small maximum overshoot, then $K=29$ ,$a=0.25$ will be the best choice.  \n\nConsider the two-degrees-of-freedom control system shown in Figure 8–66. The plant $G_{p}(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nG_{p}(s)=\\frac{100}{s(s+1)}\n$$  \n\nAssuming that the noise input $N(s)$ is zero, design controllers $G_{c1}(s)$ and $G_{c2}(s)$ such that the designed system satisfies the following:  \n\n1. The response to the step disturbance input has a small amplitude and settles to zero quickly (on the order of 1 sec to 2 sec).  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, comprising various components and signals. The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section represents the input signal, while the bottom section illustrates the output signal.\n\n**Top Section**\n\n*   **Input Signal**\n    *   A single-input signal, denoted as $R(s)$, enters the system.\n    *   This signal is processed through a series of blocks, including:\n        *   A filter represented by the transfer function $G_{c2}(s)$\n        *   An adder with input from another signal, $U(s)$\n\n**Middle Section**\n\n*   **System Blocks**\n    *   The output of the previous block is fed into a new block, labeled as \"Gp(s)\".\n    *   This block represents the plant or process being controlled.\n    *   The output of this block is then subtracted from the input signal using an adder.\n\n**Bottom Section**\n\n*   **Output Signal**\n    *   The resulting signal from the previous operation becomes the error signal, denoted as $E(s)$.\n    *   This error signal is fed into another filter represented by the transfer function $G_{c1}(s)$.\n    *   Finally, the output of this filter is subtracted from the input signal using an adder, resulting in the final output signal $Y(s)$.\n\nIn summary, the block diagram illustrates a control system with an input signal that passes through multiple blocks before being processed and then fed back into the system to produce the desired output. 8–66 Two-degrees-offreedom control system.  \n\n2.

(Each zero must contribute $109.33^{\\circ}.$ .) By a simple calculation, we find  \n\n$$\na=-3.2460\n$$  \n\nThe controller $G_{c1}(s)$ is then determined as  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}(s)\\,=\\,\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,3.2460)^{2}}{s}\n$$  \n\nThe constant $K$ must be determined by use of the magnitude condition.This condition is  \n\n$$\n|G_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)|_{s=-5+j5}=1\n$$  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\nG_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,3.2460)^{2}}{s}\\frac{100}{s(s\\,+\\,1)}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\nK=\\left|\\frac{s^{2}(s+1)}{100(s+3.2460)^{2}}\\right|_{s=-5+j5}\n$$  \n\nThe controller $G_{c1}(s)$ thus becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{G_{c1}(s)=\\frac{0.11403(s~+~3.2460)^{2}}{s}}\\\\ {=\\frac{0.11403s^{2}~+~0.74028s~+~1.20148}{s}}\\\\ {=0.74028+\\frac{1.20148}{s}+0.11403s}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen, the closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/D(s)$ is obtained as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r}{\\lefteqn{\\frac{Y(s)}{D(s)}=\\frac{G_{p}(s)}{1+G_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{=\\frac{\\frac{100}{s(s+1)}}{1+\\frac{0.11403(s+3.2460)^{2}}{s}\\frac{100}{s(s+1)}}}\\\\ &{}&\\\\ &{}&{=\\frac{100s}{s^{3}+12.403s^{2}+74.028s+120.148}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe response curve when $D(s)$ is a unit-step disturbance is shown in Figure 8–67.  \n\nThe image presents a graph illustrating the response of an input signal to a unit step disturbance. The x-axis represents time in seconds, while the y-axis denotes the amplitude of the output signal.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   **Unit Step Disturbance:** A unit step function is a mathematical function that starts at 0 and increases linearly to 1 over a specified period.\n*   **Response Curve:** The response curve shows how the output signal changes in response to the input unit step disturbance. In this case, the response curve exhibits a smooth transition from an initial value of approximately 0.8 to a final value of around 0.2 within a time frame of approximately 1 second.\n*   **Time Scale:** The x-axis is labeled with values ranging from 0 to 4 seconds, indicating that the graph represents the behavior of the system over a period of up to four seconds.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph effectively illustrates the response of an input signal to a unit step disturbance, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the system being modeled. The smooth transition in the response curve suggests a well-behaved system with minimal oscillations or overshoots. Overall, the graph provides a clear and concise visual representation of the system's behavior under a unit step disturbance. 8–67 Response to unitstep disturbance input.  \n\nNext, we consider the responses to reference inputs. The closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/R(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{\\big[G_{c1}(s)\\,+\\,G_{c2}(s)\\big]G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)}\n$$  \n\nLet us define  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{G_{c1}(s)\\,+\\,G_{c2}(s)\\,=\\,G_{c}(s)}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{{\\displaystyle\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{G_{c}(s)G_{p}(s)}{1\\,+\\,G_{c1}(s)G_{p}(s)}}}}\\\\ {{{{}}}}\\\\ {{{=\\,\\frac{100s G_{c}(s)}{s^{3}\\,+\\,12.403s^{2}\\,+\\,74.028s\\,+\\,120.148}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nTo satisfy the requirements on the responses to the ramp reference input and acceleration reference input, we use the zero-placement approach. That is, we choose the numerator of $Y(s)/R(s)$ to be the sum of the last three terms of the denominator, or  \n\n$$\n100s G_{c}(s)\\,=\\,12.403s^{2}\\,+\\,74.028s\\,+\\,120.148\n$$  \n\nfrom which we get  \n\n$$\nG_{c}(s)=\\frac{0.12403s^{2}+0.74028s\\,+\\,1.20148}{s}\n$$  \n\nHence, the closed-loop transfer function $Y(s)/R(s)$ becomes as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{12.403s^{2}\\,+\\,74.028s\\,+\\,120.148}{s^{3}\\,+\\,12.403s^{2}\\,+\\,74.028s\\,+\\,120.148}}\n$$  \n\nThe response curves to the unit-step reference input, unit-ramp reference input, and unitacceleration reference input are shown in Figures 8–68(a), (b), and (c), respectively.The maximum  \n\nThe image presents a line graph illustrating the response of an \"Omit-Step Reference Input\" over time, with the x-axis representing seconds and the y-axis representing a value between 0 and 1.4.\n\n**Graph Characteristics:**\n\n*   The graph features a single black line that begins at approximately (0,0) and increases rapidly to around (0.5,1.2), before gradually decreasing back down to around (3,1).\n*   Notably, the graph does not display any data points beyond 3 seconds.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   The graph's y-axis values range from 0 to 1.4, while the x-axis values span from 0 to 3.\n*   Although no specific labels are provided for the axes or the line itself, it appears to be a continuous function with a single peak and subsequent decline.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image illustrates the response of an \"Omit-Step Reference Input\" over time, showcasing a rapid increase followed by a gradual decrease.

The diagram is divided into several components, each representing a specific stage in the noise reduction process.\n\n*   **Input Signal (R(s))**: The input signal is represented by the variable R(s), which is fed into the system.\n*   **Disturbance (D(s))**: The disturbance or noise that affects the input signal is denoted as D(s).\n*   **Filter G1(s)**: A filter, represented by the transfer function G1(s), is applied to the input signal to reduce its magnitude. This filter is designed to minimize the impact of the disturbance on the overall system.\n*   **Filtered Signal (G1(s)R(s))**: The output of the first filter is the filtered signal, which is a combination of the original input signal and the reduced disturbance.\n*   **Disturbance at Output (D2(s))**: Although not explicitly shown in the diagram, it can be inferred that the remaining disturbance after passing through G1(s)R(s) is still present. This residual disturbance affects the overall performance of the system.\n*   **Filter G2(s)**: A second filter, represented by the transfer function G2(s), is applied to the filtered signal to further reduce its magnitude and minimize the impact of any remaining disturbance.\n*   **Final Output (G2(s)G1(s)R(s))**: The final output of the system is the result of combining the outputs from both filters. This represents the processed signal with minimized noise.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a two-stage filtering process aimed at reducing the impact of disturbances on an input signal. By applying appropriate transfer functions to the input signal, the system can effectively minimize the effects of noise and produce a cleaner output.  \n\nFigure 8–74 Control system.  \n\nB–8–7.

This box is connected to another box via an arrow, which is labeled \"Gc1\". A third box is situated below the first two boxes, with arrows pointing to both of them. The bottom section features a single box with an arrow pointing to it from the left side of the page, accompanied by the label \"D(s)\". This box is connected to another box via an arrow, which is labeled \"G1\". A third box is situated below the first two boxes, with arrows pointing to both of them.\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a technical diagram consisting of two main sections: one labeled \"Gc2\" and the other labeled \"D(s)\". Each section contains multiple interconnected boxes and arrows, which are likely representing various components or systems within an electrical circuit. The labels on the boxes suggest that they may be related to gain, resistance, or capacitance, while the arrows indicate the flow of current or signal between them.

Basic materials of state-space analysis, including the state-space representation of systems, controllability, and observability are presented in this chapter. Useful design methods based on state-feedback control are given in Chapter 10.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. Section 9–1 has presented an introduction to state-space analysis of control systems. Section 9–2 deals with the state-space representation of transfer-function systems. Here we present various canonical forms of state-space equations. Section 9–3 discusses the transformation of system models (such as from transferfunction to state-space models, and vice versa) with MATLAB. Section 9–4 presents the solution of time-invariant state equations. Section 9–5 gives some useful results in vector-matrix analysis that are necessary in studying the state-space analysis of control systems. Section 9–6 discusses the controllability of control systems and Section 9–7 treats the observability of control systems.  \n\n# 9–2 STATE-SPACE REPRESENTATIONS OF TRANSFER-FUNCTION SYSTEMS  \n\nMany techniques are available for obtaining state-space representations of transfer-function systems. In Chapter 2 we presented a few such methods. This section presents state-space representations in the controllable, observable, diagonal, or Jordan canonical forms. (Methods for obtaining such state-space representations from transfer functions are discussed in detail in Problems A–9–1 through A–9–4 .)  \n\nState-Space Representations in Canonical Forms. Consider a system defined by  \n\n$$\n{\\overset{(n)}{y}}\\,+\\,a_{1}^{\\,\\,(n-1)}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}{\\dot{y}}\\,+\\,a_{n}y\\,=\\,b_{0}^{\\,\\,(n)}\\,+\\,b_{1}^{\\,\\,(n-1)}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,b_{n-1}{\\dot{u}}\\,+\\,b_{n}u\n$$  \n\nwhere $u$ is the input and $y$ is the output.This equation can also be written as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{b_{0}s^{n}\\,+\\,b_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,b_{n-1}s\\,+\\,b_{n}}{s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}}}\n$$  \n\nIn what follows we shall present state-space representations of the system defined by Equation (9–1) or (9–2) in controllable canonical form, observable canonical form, and diagonal (or Jordan) canonical form.  \n\nControllable Canonical Form. The following state-space representation is called a controllable canonical form:  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{n-1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{\\cdots}&&{1}\\\\ {-a_{n}}&{-a_{n-1}}&{-a_{n-2}}&{\\cdots}&{-a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {x_{n-1}}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}u_{1}+...}\n$$  \n\n$$\ny=\\left[b_{n}-a_{n}b_{0}\\;\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}{{b_{n-1}-a_{n-1}b_{0}\\;\\left\\}}\\\\ {{{}b_{n}-a_{n-1}b_{0}\\;\\left\\}}\\end{array}\\right.\\right.\\cdots\\;\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}{{b_{1}-a_{1}}}\\\\ {{x_{2}}}\\\\ {{\\ddots}}\\\\ {{{}b_{n}-a_{1}b_{0}}}\\end{array}\\right.\\right]\\;+\\;b_{0}u\n$$  \n\nThe controllable canonical form is important in discussing the pole-placement approach to control systems design.  \n\nObservable Canonical Form. The following state-space representation is called an observable canonical form:  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{0}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}&{-a_{n}}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}&{-a_{n-1}}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{1}&{-a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{b_{n}-a_{n}b_{0}}\\\\ {b_{n-1}-a_{n-1}b_{0}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {b_{1}-a_{1}b_{0}}\\end{array}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{y=[0\\quad0\\quad\\cdots\\quad0\\quad1]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {x_{n-1}}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]+b_{0}u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that the $n\\times n$ state matrix of the state equation given by Equation (9–5) is the transpose of that of the state equation defined by Equation (9–3).  \n\nDiagonal Canonical Form. Consider the transfer-function system defined by Equation  (9–2). Here we consider the case where the denominator polynomial involves only distinct roots. For the distinct-roots case, Equation (9–2) can be written as  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\cfrac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{b_{0}s^{n}\\,+\\,b_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,b_{n-1}s\\,+\\,b_{n}}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})}}}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\,=\\,b_{0}+{\\frac{c_{1}}{s\\,+\\,p_{1}}}+{\\frac{c_{2}}{s\\,+\\,p_{2}}}+\\cdots+{\\frac{c_{n}}{s\\,+\\,p_{n}}}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThe diagonal canonical form of the state-space representation of this system is given by  \n\n$$\ny={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{c_{1}}&{c_{2}}&{\\cdots}&{c_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdots}\\\\ {\\cdots}\\\\ {\\cdots}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}+b_{0}u\n$$  \n\nJordan Canonical Form. Next we shall consider the case where the denominator polynomial of Equation (9–2) involves multiple roots. For this case, the preceding diagonal canonical form must be modified into the Jordan canonical form. Suppose, for example, that the $p_{i}$ ’s are different from one another, except that the first three $p_{i}$ ’s are equal, or $p_{1}=p_{2}=p_{3}$ .Then the factored form of $Y(s)/U(s)$ becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{b_{0}s^{n}+b_{1}s^{n-1}+\\dots+b_{n-1}s+b_{n}}{{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})}^{3}(s\\,+\\,p_{4})(s\\,+\\,p_{5})\\dots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})}}\n$$  \n\nThe partial-fraction expansion of this last equation becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}=b_{0}+{\\frac{c_{1}}{{\\bigl(}s+p_{1}{\\bigr)}^{3}}}+{\\frac{c_{2}}{{\\bigl(}s+p_{1}{\\bigr)}^{2}}}+{\\frac{c_{3}}{s+p_{1}}}+{\\frac{c_{4}}{s+p_{4}}}+\\cdots+{\\frac{c_{n}}{s+p_{n}}}\n$$  \n\nA state-space representation of this system in the Jordan canonical form is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{3}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{4}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\,=\\,{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{-p_{1}}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{-p_{1}}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{-p_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {\\vdots}&&{\\vdots}\\\\ {0}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&&{\\cdot}\\\\ {0}&{\\cdots}&&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\\\ {x_{4}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\bar{x}_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\,+\\,{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\\\ {1}\\\\ {1}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}u,\n$$  \n\n$$\ny={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{c_{1}}&{c_{2}}&{\\cdots}&{c_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}{\\sqrt{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\ddots}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdots}\\\\ {\\ddots}\\\\ {\\ddots}\\\\ {\\ddots}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}}}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}+b_{0}u\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{s\\,+\\,3}{s^{2}\\,+\\,3s\\,+\\,2}}\n$$  \n\nObtain state-space representations in the controllable canonical form, observable canonical form, and diagonal canonical form.  \n\nControllable Canonical Form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\left[\\dot{x}_{1}(t)\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{0}&{1}\\\\ {-2}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}(t)}\\\\ {x_{2}(t)}\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]u(t)}\\\\ {y(t)=[3}&{1]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}(t)}\\\\ {x_{2}(t)}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nObservable Canonical Form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\bigg[\\dot{x}_{1}(t)\\bigg]=\\bigg[0}&{-2\\bigg]\\bigg[\\sum_{x_{1}(t)}\\bigg]+\\bigg[3\\bigg]u(t)}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}(t)\\bigg]=\\bigg[1}&{-3\\bigg]\\bigg[\\sum_{x_{2}(t)}\\biggr]+\\bigg[1\\bigg]u(t)}\\\\ {y(t)=[0}&{1]\\bigg[\\sum_{x_{1}(t)}\\biggr]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDiagonal Canonical Form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}(t)}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}(t)\\biggr]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{-1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{-2}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}(t)}\\\\ {x_{2}(t)\\biggr]+\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!u(t)}\\\\ &{\\qquad y(t)=[2\\!\\!}&{-1]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}(t)}\\\\ {x_{2}(t)}\\end{array}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEigenvalues of an $\\textbf{\\em n}\\times\\textbf{\\em n}$ Matrix A.

Notice also that the diagonal elements of the matrix $\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}$ in Equation (9–19) are identical with the three eigenvalues of A . It is very important to note that the eigenvalues of A and those of $\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}$ are identical.We shall prove this for a general case in what follows.  \n\nInvariance of Eigenvalues. To prove the invariance of the eigenvalues under a linear transformation, we must show that the characteristic polynomials $|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|$ and $\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\right|$ are identical.  \n\nSince the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants, we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\right|=\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{P}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\right|}&{}\\\\ {\\,=\\,\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{P}\\right|}\\\\ {\\,=\\,\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\right|\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\right|\\mathbf{P}\\right|}\\\\ {\\,=\\,\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\right|\\left|\\mathbf{P}\\right|\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\right|}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nNot at the product of the determinants $\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\right|$ and $\\left|\\mathbf{P}\\right|$ is the determinant of the product $\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{P}\\right|$ , we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\right.-\\left.\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\right|=\\left.\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{P}\\right|\\right|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\right.-\\left.\\mathbf{A}\\right|}\\\\ &{\\ }\\\\ &{=\\left.\\left|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\right.-\\left.\\mathbf{A}\\right|}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThus, we have proved that the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$ are invariant under a linear transformation.  \n\nNonuniqueness of a Set of State Variables. It has been stated that a set of state variables is not unique for a given system.Suppose that $x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ are a set of state variables.  \n\nThen we may take as another set of state variables any set of functions  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\hat{x}_{1}=\\,X_{1}\\!\\left(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\right)}\\\\ {\\hat{x}_{2}=\\,X_{2}\\!\\left(x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}\\right)}\\\\ {\\quad\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\hat{x}}_{n}\\,=\\,X_{n}{\\bigl(}x_{1},\\,x_{2},\\ldots,\\,x_{n}{\\bigr)}\n$$  \n\nprovided that, for every set of values ${\\hat{x}}_{1},{\\hat{x}}_{2},\\ldots,{\\hat{x}}_{n}$ ,there corresponds a unique set of values $x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots,x_{n}$ ,and vice versa.Thus, if $\\mathbf{X}$ is a state vector, then $\\hat{\\bf x}$ ,where  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nis also a state vector,provided the matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ is nonsingular.Different state vectors convey the same information about the system behavior.  \n\n# 9–3 TRANSFORMATION OF SYSTEM MODELS WITH MATLAB  \n\nIn this section we shall consider the transformation of the system model from transfer function to state space, and vice versa. We shall begin our discussion with the transformation from transfer function to state space.  \n\nLet us write the closed-loop transfer function as  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{\\mathrm{numerator~polynomial~in~}}{\\mathrm{denominator~polynomial~in~}}}s={\\frac{\\mathrm{num}}{\\mathrm{den}}}\n$$  \n\nOnce we have this transfer-function expression, the MATLAB command  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{A},\\,\\mathsf{B},\\,\\mathsf{C},\\,\\mathsf{D}]=\\mathsf{t f}2\\mathsf{s s}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})\n$$  \n\nwill give a state-space representation. It is important to note that the state-space representation for any system is not unique.There are many (indeed, infinitely many) statespace representations for the same system.The MATLAB command gives one possible such state-space representation.  \n\nState-Space Formulation of Transfer-Function Systems. Consider the transfer-function system  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\\frac{10s\\,+\\,10}{s^{3}\\,+\\,6s^{2}\\,+\\,5s\\,+\\,10}\n$$  \n\nThere are many (again, infinitely many) possible state-space representations for this system. One possible state-space representation is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\left[{\\dot{x}}_{1}\\right]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\;\\;\\;0}&{1}&{\\;\\;0}\\\\ {\\;\\;\\;0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-10}&{-5}&{-6}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\;\\;\\;0}\\\\ {\\;\\;10}\\\\ {-50}\\end{array}\\right]}u}\\\\ {y=[1}&{0}&{0]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+[0]u}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nAnother possible state-space representation (among infinitely many alternatives) is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{-6}&{-5}&{-10}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}u}\\\\ &{\\qquad y=\\left[0\\quad10\\quad10\\right]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+\\left[0\\right]u}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB transforms the transfer function given by Equation (9–22) into the state-space representation given by Equations (9–23) and (9–24).For the example system considered here, MATLAB Program 9–1 will produce matrices $\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C}$ , and $D$ .  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program with two matrices, A and B, and their corresponding results. The purpose of the code is to perform matrix operations using the built-in functions provided by MATLAB.\n\n*   **Matrix A**\n    *   Matrix A is defined as:\n        *   num = [10 20; 30 40]\n        *   den = [16 5; 10]\n        *   A,B,C,D = tf2ss(num,den)\n    *   The matrix has two rows and two columns.\n    *   The elements of the matrix are integers.\n*   **Matrix B**\n    *   Matrix B is defined as:\n        *   B = [1 0; 0 1]\n    *   The matrix has two rows and two columns.\n    *   The elements of the matrix are integers.\n*   **Resulting Matrices C and D**\n    *   The resulting matrices C and D are not explicitly shown in the image, but they can be calculated using the tf2ss function provided by MATLAB.\n    *   These matrices would represent the state-space representation of a system defined by the transfer function.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a MATLAB program that defines two matrices, A and B, and calculates their corresponding resulting matrices C and D using the tf2ss function. The program demonstrates how to use built-in functions in MATLAB to perform matrix operations and calculate state-space representations of systems.  \n\nTransformation from State Space to Transfer Function. To obtain the transfer function from state-space equations, use the following command:  \n\niu must be specified for systems with more than one input. For example, if the system has three inputs $\\left(u1,u2,u3\\right)$ ,then iu must be either 1, 2, or 3, where 1 implies u1, 2 implies $u2$ ,and 3 implies u3.  \n\nIf the system has only one input, then either  \n\n$$\n[\\mathrm{num},\\mathrm{den}]=\\mathrm{ss}2\\mathrm{tf}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D})\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n}]=\\mathsf{s s}2\\mathsf{t f}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C},\\mathsf{D},1)\n$$  \n\nmay be used. (See Example 9–3 and MATLAB Program 9–2.)  \n\nFor the case where the system has multiple inputs and multiple outputs, see Example 9–4.  \n\nEXAMPLE 9–3 Obtain the transfer function of the system defined by the following state-space equations:  \n\n$$\ny=[1\\quad0\\quad0]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nMATLAB Program 9–2 will produce the transfer function for the given system. The transfer function obtained is given by  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\\frac{25.04s\\,+\\,5.008}{s^{3}\\,+\\,5.0325s^{2}\\,+\\,25.1026s\\,+\\,5.008}\n$$  \n\nThe image shows a screenshot of a MATLAB program, with the title \"MATLAB Program 9-2\" at the top.

The code is written in black text on a white background.\n\n*   **Matrix A**\n    *   The first matrix is denoted as A.\n    *   It has dimensions 2x3.\n    *   Its elements are: [0, 1;-25,-4].\n*   **Matrix B**\n    *   The second matrix is denoted as B.\n    *   It has dimensions 3x2.\n    *   Its elements are: [1, 0;0, 1].\n*   **Resultant Matrix C**\n    *   The resultant matrix is denoted as C.\n    *   It will have the same dimensions as A and B (i.e., 2x2).\n    *   The calculation for each element of C involves multiplying corresponding elements from rows of A with columns of B and summing them up.\n*   **MATLAB Code**\n    *   The code uses MATLAB's matrix multiplication syntax, denoted by the '*'.\n    *   It specifies the matrices A and B explicitly in the code.\n\nIn summary, the image presents a simple example of matrix multiplication using MATLAB. Given two input matrices A and B with specific dimensions and elements, it calculates the resulting matrix C through element-wise multiplication followed by summation for each corresponding pair of elements across rows of A and columns of B.  \n\nThis is the MATLAB representation of the following four transfer functions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l c l}{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y_{1}(s)}{U_{1}(s)}=\\frac{s\\,+\\,4}{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,25},}}}&{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y_{2}(s)}{U_{1}(s)}=\\frac{-25}{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,25}}}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y_{1}(s)}{U_{2}(s)}=\\frac{s\\,+\\,5}{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,25},}}}&{{\\displaystyle{\\frac{Y_{2}(s)}{U_{2}(s)}=\\frac{s\\,-\\,25}{s^{2}\\,+\\,4s\\,+\\,25}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn this section,we shall obtain the general solution of the linear time-invariant state equation.We shall first consider the homogeneous case and then the nonhomogeneous case.  \n\nSolution of Homogeneous State Equations.

Specifically, we present the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, the minimal polynomial,Sylvester’s interpolation method for calculating $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ ,and the linear independence of vectors.  \n\nCayley–Hamilton Theorem. The Cayley–Hamilton theorem is very useful in proving theorems involving matrix equations or solving problems involving matrix equations.  \n\nConsider an $n\\times n$ matrix A and its characteristic equation:  \n\n$$\n\\vert\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\vert\\,=\\,\\lambda^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}\\lambda^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}\\lambda\\,+\\,a_{n}=0\n$$  \n\nThe Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that the matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation, or that  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}\\,\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}\\,\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,a_{n}\\,\\mathbf{I}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nTo prove this theorem, note that adj $\\left(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\right)$ is a polynomial in $\\lambda$ of degree $n\\,-\\,1$ .That is,  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname{adj}(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A})=\\mathbf{B}_{1}\\lambda^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{2}\\lambda^{n-2}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{n-1}\\lambda\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{n}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}_{1}=\\mathbf{I},$ .Since  \n\n$$\n(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})\\;\\mathrm{adj}(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})=[\\mathrm{adj}(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})](\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A})=|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{I}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|\\mathbf{I}=\\mathbf{I}\\lambda^{n}+\\,a_{1}\\mathbf{I}\\lambda^{n-1}+\\dots+\\,a_{n-1}\\mathbf{I}\\lambda\\,+\\,a_{n}\\mathbf{I}}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=\\,(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}){\\big(}\\mathbf{B}_{1}\\lambda^{n-1}+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{2}\\lambda^{n-2}+\\dots+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{n-1}\\lambda\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{n}{\\big)}}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad=\\,{\\big(}\\mathbf{B}_{1}\\lambda^{n-1}+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{2}\\lambda^{n-2}+\\dots+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{n-1}\\lambda\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}_{n}{\\big)}(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\,\\mathbf{A})}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nFrom this equation, we see that $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{i}\\left(i=1,2,\\ldots,n\\right)$ commute. Hence, the product of $(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A})$ and adj $\\left(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\right)$ becomes zero if either of these is zero. If $\\mathbf{A}$ is substituted for $\\lambda$ in this last equation, then clearly $\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}$ becomes zero. Hence, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}\\,\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}\\,\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,a_{n}\\,\\mathbf{I}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nThis proves the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, or Equation (9–44).  \n\nMinimal Polynomial. Referring to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, every $n\\times n$ matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is not, however, necessarily the scalar equation of least degree that A satisfies.The least-degree polynomial having $\\mathbf{A}$ as a root is called the minimal polynomial . That is, the minimal polynomial of an $n\\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is defined as the polynomial $\\phi(\\lambda)$ of least degree,  \n\n$$\n\\phi(\\lambda)\\,=\\,\\lambda^{m}\\,+\\,a_{1}\\lambda^{m-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{m-1}\\lambda\\,+\\,a_{m},\\qquad m\\,\\le\\,n\n$$  \n\nsuch that $\\phi(\\mathbf{A})=\\mathbf{0}$ ,or  \n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{A})=\\mathbf{A}^{m}+a_{1}\\mathbf{A}^{m-1}+\\cdots+\\,a_{m-1}\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,a_{m}\\mathbf{I}=\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nThe minimal polynomial plays an important role in the computation of polynomials in an $n\\times n$ matrix.  \n\nLet us suppose that $d(\\lambda)$ ,a polynomial in $\\lambda$ , is the greatest common divisor of all the elements of adj $\\left(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\right)$ .We can show that if the coefficient of the highest-degree term in $\\lambda$ of $d(\\lambda)$ is chosen as 1, then the minimal polynomial $\\phi(\\lambda)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\phi(\\lambda)=\\frac{|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|}{d(\\lambda)}\n$$  \n\n[See Problem $\\mathbf{A-9-8}$ for the derivation of Equation (9–45).]  \n\nIt is noted that the minimal polynomial $\\phi(\\lambda)$ of an $n\\times n$ matrix A can be determined by the following procedure:  \n\n1. Form adj $\\left(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\right)$ and write the elements of adj $\\left(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\right)$ as factored polynomials in $\\lambda$ .  \n2. Determine $d(\\lambda)$ as the greatest common divisor of all the elements of adj $\\left(\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\right)$ .Choose the coefficient of the highest-degree term in $\\lambda$ of $d(\\lambda)$ to be 1.If there is no common divisor, $d(\\lambda)=1$ .  \n3. The minimal polynomial $\\phi(\\lambda)$ is then given as $|\\lambda\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|$ divided by $d(\\lambda)$ .  \n\nMatrix Exponential $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ .In solving control engineering problems, it often becomes necessary to compute $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ .If matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is given with all elements in numerical values, MATLAB provides a simple way to compute $e^{\\mathbf{A}T}$ , where $T$ is a constant.  \n\nAside from computational methods, several analytical methods are available for the computation of $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ .We shall present three methods here.  \n\nComputation of $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}.$ : Method 1. If matrix A can be transformed into a diagonal form, then $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ can be given by  \n\n$$\ne^{\\mathbf{A}t}=\\mathbf{P}e^{\\mathbf{D}t}\\mathbf{P}^{-1}=\\mathbf{P}\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c}{e^{\\lambda_{1}t}}&&&&&{0}\\\\ &{e^{\\lambda_{2}t}}&&&&\\\\ &&{\\cdot}&&&\\\\ &&&{\\cdot}&&\\\\ &&&&{\\cdot}&\\\\ {0}&&&&&{e^{\\lambda_{n}t}}\\end{array}\\right]\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{P}$ is a diagonalizing matrix for A . [For the derivation of Equation (9–46), see Problem A–9–11 .]  \n\nIf matrix A can be transformed into a Jordan canonical form,then $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ can be given by  \n\n$$\ne^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{S}e^{\\mathbf{J}t}\\mathbf{S}^{-1}\n$$  \n\nwhere Sis a transformation matrix that transforms matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ into a Jordan canonical form J.  \n\nAs an example, consider the following matrix A:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{-3}&{3}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n\\vert\\lambda\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\vert\\,=\\,\\lambda^{3}\\,-\\,3\\lambda^{2}\\,+\\,3\\lambda\\,-\\,1\\,=\\,(\\lambda\\,-\\,1)^{3}\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThus,matrix A has a multiple eigenvalue of order 3 at $\\lambda=1.$ It can be shown that matrix A has a multiple eigenvector of order 3.The transformation matrix that will transform matrix A into a Jordan canonical form can be given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{2}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nThe inverse of matrix Sis  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}^{-1}=\\left[{\\begin{array}{r r r}{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {-1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{-2}&{1}\\end{array}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThen it can be seen that  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\mathbf{S}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{S}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {-1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{-2}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{-3}&{3}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{2}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\\\ {={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{1}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}=\\mathbf{J}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nNoting that  \n\n$$\ne^{\\mathbf{J}t}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{e^{t}}&{t e^{t}}&{{\\frac{1}{2}}t^{2}e^{t}}\\\\ {0}&{e^{t}}&{t e^{t}}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{e^{t}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nwe find  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{e^{\\mathbf{A}t}=\\mathbf{S}e^{\\mathbf{J}t}\\mathbf{S}^{-1}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{2}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{e^{t}}&{t e^{t}}&{\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}\\\\ {0}&{e^{t}}&{t e^{t}}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{e^{t}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {-1}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{-2}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{e^{t}-t e^{t}+\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}&{t e^{t}-t^{2}e^{t}}&{\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}\\\\ {\\;}&{\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}&{e^{t}-t e^{t}-t^{2}e^{t}}&{t e^{t}+\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}\\\\ {t e^{t}+\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}&{-3t e^{t}-t^{2}e^{t}}&{e^{t}+2t e^{t}+\\frac{1}{2}t^{2}e^{t}}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nComputation of $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ : Method 2. The second method of computing $e^{\\mathbf{A}t}$ uses the Laplace transform approach.

A system is said to be controllable at time $t_{0}$ if it is possible by means of an unconstrained control vector to transfer the system from any initial state ${\\bf x}(t_{0})$ to any other state in a finite interval of time.  \n\nA system is said to be observable at time $t_{0}$ if,with the system in state ${\\bf x}(t_{0})$ ,it is possible to determine this state from the observation of the output over a finite time interval.  \n\nThe concepts of controllability and observability were introduced by Kalman.They play an important role in the design of control systems in state space. In fact, the conditions of controllability and observability may govern the existence of a complete solution to the control system design problem. The solution to this problem may not exist if the system considered is not controllable. Although most physical systems are controllable and observable, corresponding mathematical models may not possess the property of controllability and observability.Then it is necessary to know the conditions under which a system is controllable and observable.This section deals with controllability and the next section discusses observability.  \n\nIn what follows, we shall first derive the condition for complete state controllability.

The condition for complete state controllability can be stated in terms of transfer functions or transfer matrices.  \n\nIt can be proved that a necessary and sufficient condition for complete state controllability is that no cancellation occur in the transfer function or transfer matrix. If cancellation occurs, the system cannot be controlled in the direction of the canceled mode.  \n\nEXAMPLE 9–13 Consider the following transfer function:  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{X(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{s\\,+\\,2.5}{(s\\,+\\,2.5)(s\\,-\\,1)}}\n$$  \n\nClearly, cancellation of the factor $(s+2.5)$ occurs in the numerator and denominator of this transfer function. (Thus one degree of freedom is lost.) Because of this cancellation, this system is not completely state controllable.  \n\nThe same conclusion can be obtained by writing this transfer function in the form of a state equation.A state-space representation is  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {2.5}&{-1.5}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{B}\\;\\;\\vdots\\;\\;\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nthe rank of the matrix $\\left[\\mathbf{B}\\right.\\vdots\\left.\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\right]$ is 1.Therefore, we arrive at the same conclusion:The system is not completely state controllable.  \n\nOutput Controllability. In the practical design of a control system, we may want to control the output rather than the state of the system. Complete state controllability is neither necessary nor sufficient for controlling the output of the system. For this reason, it is desirable to define separately complete output controllability.  \n\nConsider the system described by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{\\delta}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{\\delta}\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{u}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf x=\\mathrm{state\\;vector}\\;(n\\mathrm{\\-vector})}\\\\ &{\\mathbf u=\\mathrm{control}\\;\\mathrm{vector}\\;(r\\mathrm{\\-vector})}\\\\ &{\\mathbf y=\\mathrm{output\\;vector}\\;(m\\mathrm{\\-vector})}\\\\ &{\\mathbf A=n\\times n\\;\\mathrm{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf B=n\\times r\\;\\mathrm{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf C=m\\times n\\;\\mathrm{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf D=m\\times r\\;\\mathrm{matrix}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe system described by Equations (9–61) and (9–62) is said to be completely output controllable if it is possible to construct an unconstrained control vector ${\\bf\\delta u}(t)$ that will y given initial output $\\mathbf{y}(t_{0})$ to any final output $\\mathbf{y}(t_{1})$ in a finite time interval $t_{0}\\le t\\le t_{1}$ .  \n\nIt can be proved that the condition for complete output controllability is as follows: The system described by Equations (9–61) and (9–62) is completely output controllable if and only if the $m\\,\\times\\,(n\\,+\\,1)r$ matrix  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{CB}\\mathbf{\\begin{array}{l l l l l l l}{\\vdots}&{\\mathbf{CAB}}&{\\vdots}&{\\mathbf{CA^{2}B}}&{\\vdots}&{\\cdots}&{\\vdots}&{\\mathbf{CA^{n-1}B}}&{\\vdots}&{\\mathbf{D}}\\end{array}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nis of rank m. (For a proof, see Problem A–9–16 .) Note that the presence of the Du term in Equation (9–62) always helps to establish output controllability.  \n\nUncontrollable System. An uncontrollable system has a subsystem that is physically disconnected from the input.  \n\nStabilizability. For a partially controllable system, if the uncontrollable modes are stable and the unstable modes are controllable, the system is said to be stabilizable. For example, the system defined by  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{-1}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}u\n$$  \n\nis not state controllable.The stable mode that corresponds to the eigenvalue of $-1$ is not controllable.The unstable mode that corresponds to the eigenvalue of 1 is controllable. Such a system can be made stable by the use of a suitable feedback.Thus this system is stabilizable.  \n\n# 9–7 OBSERVABILITY  \n\nIn this section we discuss the observability of linear systems. Consider the unforced system described by the following equations:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}=$ state vector ($n$ -vector )  \n\n$\\mathbf{y}=$ output vector (m -vector )  \n$\\mathbf{A}=n\\times n$ matrix   \nC=m\\* nmatrix  \n\nThe system is said to be mpletely observable if ever ${\\bf x}\\!\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ can be determined from the observation of $\\mathbf{y}(t)$ over a finite time interval, $t_{0}\\le t\\le t_{1}$ .The system is, therefore, completely observable if every transition of the state eventually affects every element of the output vector.The concept of observability is useful in solving the problem of reconstructing unmeasurable state variables from measurable variables in the minimum possible length of time. In this section we treat only linear, time-invariant systems. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that $t_{0}=0$ .  \n\nThe concept of observability is very important because, in practice, the difficulty encountered with state feedback control is that some of the state variables are not accessible for direct measurement, with the result that it becomes necessary to estimate the unmeasurable state variables in order to construct the control signals. It will be shown in Section 10–5 that such estimates of state variables are possible if and only if the system is completely observable.  \n\nIn discussing observability conditions, we consider the unforced system as given by Equations (9–63) and (9–64).The reason for this is as follows: If the system is described by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{\\delta}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{u}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nthen  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,=\\,e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)+\\int_{0}^{t}e^{\\mathbf{A}(t-\\tau)}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\n$$  \n\nand $\\mathbf{y}(t)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,+\\,\\mathbf{C}\\int_{0}^{t}e^{\\mathbf{A}(t-\\tau)}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}(\\tau)\\,d\\tau\\,+\\,\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{u}\n$$  \n\nSince the matrices $\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B},\\mathbf{C}$ , and $\\mathbf{D}$ are known and ${\\bf\\delta u}(t)$ is also known, the last two terms on the right-hand side of this last equation are known quantities. Therefore, they may be subtracted from the observed value of ${\\bf y}(t)$ .Hence, for investigating a necessary and sufficient condition for complete observability,it suffices to consider the system described by Equations (9–63) and (9–64).  \n\nComplete Observability of Continuous-Time Systems. Consider the system described by Equations (9–63) and (9–64).The output vector $\\mathbf{y}(t)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\n$$  \n\nReferring to Equation (9–48) or (9–50), we have  \n\n$$\ne^{\\mathbf{A}t}=\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\alpha_{k}(t)\\,\\mathbf{A}^{k}\n$$  \n\nwhere $n$ is the degree of the characteristic polynomial. [Note that Equations (9–48) and (9–50) with $_m$ replaced by $n$ can be derived using the characteristic polynomial.]  \n\nHence, we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\mathbf{y}}(t)\\,=\\,\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\alpha_{k}(t){\\mathbf{C}}{\\mathbf{A}}^{k}{\\mathbf{x}}(0)\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,=\\,\\alpha_{0}(t)\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,+\\,\\alpha_{1}(t)\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,+\\,\\cdots+\\,\\alpha_{n-1}(t)\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\mathbf{x}(0)\n$$  \n\nIf the system is completely observable, then, given the output $\\mathbf{y}(t)$ over a time interval $0\\le t\\le t_{1},{\\bf x}(0)$ is uniquely determined from Equation (9–65). It can be shown that this requires the rank of the $n m\\times n$ matrix  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\overbrace{\\phantom{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}{\\nabla_{\\mathrm{e}}\\kappa}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\nabla_{\\mathrm{e}}\\kappa}\\end{array}\\right)}^{\\mathbf{C}}}^{\\mathbf{C}}}\\\\ {\\cdot\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}\\\\ {\\cdot\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;}\\\\ {\\cdot\\--\\cdots\\cdots}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nto be $n$ .(See Problem A–9–19 for the derivation of this condition.)  \n\nFrom this analysis, we can state the condition for complete observability as follows: The system described by Equations (9–63) and (9–64) is completely observable if and only if the $n\\times n m$ matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mid\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mid\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdots\\mid\\mathbf{\\nabla}(\\mathbf{A}^{*})^{n-1}\\mathbf{C}^{*}]\n$$  \n\nis of rank $n$ or has $n$ linearly independent column vectors. This matrix is called the observability matrix.  \n\nEXAMPLE 9–14 Consider the system described by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left[\\dot{x}_{1}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{1}&{1}\\\\ {-2}&{-1}\\end{array}\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]\\!\\!u}\\\\ &{\\qquad y=[1}&{0]\\!\\!\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIs this system controllable and observable? Since the rank of the matrix  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{B}\\;\\;\\vdots\\;\\;\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{-1\\underline{{\\mathbf{\\sigma}}}}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nis 2, the system is completely state controllable.  \n\nFor output controllability, let us find the rank of the matrix $\\left[\\mathbf{CB}\\right.\\mathrm{~};\\mathrm{~}\\left.\\mathbf{CAB}\\right]$ .Since  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{CB}\\ :\\ \\mathbf{CAB}\\right]=\\left[0\\ \\ 1\\right]\n$$  \n\nthe rank of this matrix is 1. Hence, the system is completely output controllable. To test the observability condition, examine the rank of $\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]$ .Since  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nthe rank of $\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]$ is 2. Hence, the system is completely observable.  \n\nConditions for Complete Observability in the s Plane. The conditions for complete observability can also be stated in terms of transfer functions or transfer matrices. The necessary and sufficient conditions for complete observability is that no cancellation occur in the transfer function or transfer matrix. If cancellation occurs, the canceled mode cannot be observed in the output.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 9–15  \n\nShow that the following system is not completely observable:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{\\beta}}\\\\ {y\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-6}&{-11}&{-6}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{C}=[4}&{5}&{1]\n$$  \n\nNote that the control function $u$ does not affect the complete observability of the system.To examine complete observability, we may simply set $u\\,=\\,0$ .For this system, we have  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\vdots\\ \\left(\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\mathbf{C}^{*}]=\\left[\\begin{array}{r r r}{4}&{-6}&{6}\\\\ {5}&{-7}&{5}\\\\ {1}&{-1}&{-1}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nNote that  \n\n$$\n\\left|{\\begin{array}{r r r}{4}&{-6}&{6}\\\\ {5}&{-7}&{5}\\\\ {1}&{-1}&{-1}\\end{array}}\\right|=0\n$$  \n\nHence, the rank of the matrix $\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\;\\vdots\\;\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\;\\vdots\\;\\mathbf{\\Gamma}(\\mathbf{A}^{*})^{2}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]$ is less than 3.Therefore, the system is not completely observable.  \n\nIn fact, in this system, cancellation occurs in the transfer function of the system.The transfer function between $X_{1}(s)$ and $U(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n\\frac{X_{1}(s)}{U(s)}=\\frac{1}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)}\n$$  \n\nand the transfer function between $Y(s)$ and $X_{1}(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{X_{1}(s)}}=\\,(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)\n$$  \n\nTherefore, the transfer function between the output $Y(s)$ and the input $U(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,4)}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,3)}}\n$$  \n\nClearly, the two factors $(s+1)$ cancel each other.This means that there are nonzero initial states ${\\bf x}(0)$ ,which cannot be determined from the measurement of $y(t)$ .  \n\nComments. The transfer function has no cancellation if and only if the system is completely state controllable and completely observable.This means that the canceled transfer function does not carry along all the information characterizing the dynamic system.  \n\nAlternative Form of the Condition for Complete Observability. Consider the system described by Equations (9–63) and (9–64), rewritten  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSuppose that the transformation matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ transforms $\\mathbf{A}$ into a diagonal matrix, or  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}=\\mathbf{D}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{D}$ is a diagonal matrix. Let us define  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{z}\n$$  \n\nThen Equations (9–66) and (9–67) can be written  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{\\mathbf{z}}=\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{z}=\\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{z}}}\\\\ {{\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{z}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{P}e^{\\mathbf{D}t}\\mathbf{z}(0)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{CP}\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c c}{e^{\\lambda_{1}t}}&&&&&{0}\\\\ &{e^{\\lambda_{2}t}}&&&&\\\\ &&{\\cdot}&&&\\\\ &&&{\\cdot}&&\\\\ &&&&{\\cdot}&\\\\ {0}&&&&&{e^{\\lambda_{n}t}}\\end{array}\\right]\\mathbf{z}(0)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{CP}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{e^{\\lambda_{1}t}z_{1}(0)}\\\\ {e^{\\lambda_{2}t}z_{2}(0)}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {e^{\\lambda_{n}t}z_{n}(0)}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThe system is completely observable if none of the columns of the $m\\times n$ matrix CP consists of all zero elements.This is because, if the i th column of CP consists of all zero elements, then the state variable $z_{i}(0)$ will not appear in the output equation and therefore cannot be determined from observation of $\\mathbf{y}(t)$ .Thus, ${\\bf x}(0)$ ,which is related to ${\\bf z}(0)$ by the nonsingular matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ ,cannot be determined.(Remember that this test applies only if the matrix $\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}$ is in diagonal form.)  \n\nIf the matrix A cannot be transformed into a diagonal matrix,then by use of a suitable transformation matrix S, we can transform A into a Jordan canonical form, or  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{J}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is in the Jordan canonical form. Let us define  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{z}\n$$  \n\nThen Equations (9–66) and (9–67) can be written  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle{\\dot{\\bf z}}\\,=\\,{\\bf S}^{-1}{\\bf A}{\\bf S}{\\bf z}}={\\bf J}{\\bf z}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle{\\bf y}\\,=\\,{\\bf C}{\\bf S}{\\bf z}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{S}e^{\\mathbf{J}t}\\mathbf{z}(0)\n$$  \n\nThe system is completely observable if (1) no two Jordan blocks in Jare associated with the same eigenvalues, (2) no columns of CS that correspond to the first row of each Jordan block consist of zero elements, and (3) no columns of CS that correspond to distinct eigenvalues consist of zero elements.  \n\nTo clarify condition (2), in Example 9–16 we have encircled by dashed lines the columns of CS that correspond to the first row of each Jordan block.  \n\nEXAMPLE 9–16 The following systems are completely observable.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{-1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{-2}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad y=[1}&{3]\\Bigg[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\\\ &{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{2}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{2}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right],\\qquad\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{y_{1}}\\\\ {y_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{[3]!}&{0}\\\\ {\\vdots}&{0}\\\\ {\\mu\\vdots}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\\\ &{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\dot{x}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{2}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{2}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}\\\\ &{\\dot{x}_{3}}\\\\ &{\\dot{x}_{4}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image presents a collection of mathematical equations, specifically linear algebra matrices and their corresponding vector representations.

We shall now discuss the relationship between controllability and observability.We shall introduce the principle of duality, due to Kalman, to clarify apparent analogies between controllability and observability.  \n\nConsider the system $S_{1}$ described by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{y}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{x}=\\operatorname{state~vector~}(n{\\mathrm{-vector}})}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{u}=\\operatorname{control~vector~}(r{\\mathrm{-vector}})}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{y}=\\operatorname{output~vector~}(m{\\mathrm{-vector}})}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{A}=n\\times n\\operatorname{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{B}=n\\times r\\operatorname{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{C}=m\\times n\\operatorname{matrix}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nand the dual system $S_{2}$ defined by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{z}}=\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{z}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}+\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{v}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{z}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\textbf{Z}}=$ state vector ($n$ -vector )  \n\n$\\textbf{v}=$ control vector (m -vector )$\\mathbf{n}=$ output vector ($r$ -vector )$\\mathbf{A}^{*}=$ conjugate transpose of A $\\mathbf{B}^{*}=$ conjugate transpose of $\\mathbf{B}$ $\\mathbf{C}^{*}=$ conjugate transpose of C  \n\nThe principle of duality states that the system $S_{1}$ is completely state controllable (observable) if and only if system $S_{2}$ is completely observable (state controllable).  \n\nTo verify this principle, let us write down the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete state controllability and complete observability for systems $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ .  \n\nFor system $S_{1}$ :  \n\n1. A necessary and sufficient condition for complete state controllability is that the rank of the $n\\times n r$ matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{B}\\ :\\ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\ :\\ \\cdots\\ ;\\ \\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\mathbf{B}]\n$$  \n\nbe $n$ .  \n\n2. A necessary and sufficient condition for complete observability is that the rank of the $n\\times n m$ matrix  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\right\\vert\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\vdots\\ \\cdots\\ \\vdots\\ \\left(\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\right)^{n-1}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]\n$$  \n\nbe $n$ .  \n\nFor system $S_{2}$ :  \n\n1. A necessary and sufficient condition for complete state controllability is that the rank of the $n\\times n m$ matrix  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\right\\vert\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\vdots\\ \\cdots\\ \\vdots\\ \\left(\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\right)^{n-1}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]\n$$  \n\nbe $n$ .  \n\n2. A necessary and sufficient condition for complete observability is that the rank of the $n\\times n r$ matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{B}\\ :\\ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\ :\\ \\cdots\\ ;\\ \\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\mathbf{B}]\n$$  \n\nbe $n$ .  \n\nBy comparing these conditions, the truth of this principle is apparent. By use of this principle, the observability of a given system can be checked by testing the state controllability of its dual.  \n\nDetectability. For a partially observable system, if the unobservable modes are stable and the observable modes are unstable, the system is said to be detectable. Note that the concept of detectability is dual to the concept of stabilizability.  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–9–1.

Discuss the state controllability of the following system:  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{\\dot{x}_{1}}{\\dot{x}_{2}}}={\\binom{\\mathord{\\overbrace{-3}}}{-2}}\\-\\ \\ 1\\-\\{\\Biggl[}{\\Biggl[}{\\Biggl[}{x_{1}}{\\Biggr]}+{\\Biggl[}{\\Biggl]}{u}\n$$  \n\nSolution. For this system,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{-3}&{1}\\\\ {-2}&{1.5}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {4}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{AB}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{-3}&{1}\\\\ {-2}&{1.5}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {4}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{1}\\\\ {4}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nwe see that vectors $\\mathbf{B}$ and AB are not linearly independent and the rank of the matrix $[\\mathbf{B}_{}^{\\mathrm{~\\tiny~}}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}]$ is 1. Therefore, the system is not completely state controllable. In fact, elimination of $x_{2}$ from Equation (9–119), or the following two simultaneous equations,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{x}_{1}=-3x_{1}\\,+\\,x_{2}\\,+\\,u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\dot{x}_{2}=-2x_{1}\\,+\\,1.5x_{2}\\,+\\,4u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nyields  \n\n$$\n\\ddot{x}_{1}\\,+\\,1.5\\dot{x}_{1}\\,-\\,2.5x_{1}\\,=\\,\\dot{u}\\,+\\,2.5u\n$$  \n\nor, in the form of a transfer function,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{X_{1}(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{s\\,+\\,2.5}{(s\\,+\\,2.5)(s\\,-\\,1)}}\n$$  \n\nNotice that cancellation of the factor $(s+2.5)$ occurs in the numerator and denominator of the transfer function. Because of this cancellation, this system is not completely state controllable. This is an unstable system. Remember that stability and controllability are quite different things. There are many systems that are unstable, but are completely state controllable.  \n\nA–9–17. A state-space representation of a system in the controllable canonical form is given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}{\\ }}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{\\;\\,0\\;\\;}&{\\;\\,1}\\\\ {\\;\\,-0.4\\;\\;-1.3{\\sqrt{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}}+{\\biggl[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}u}\\\\ {y={\\left[0.8\\;\\;\\;1\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe same system may be represented by the following state-space equation, which is in the observable canonical form:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{\\left[\\dot{x}_{1}\\right]=\\left[0\\!\\!\\!\\!}&{{}\\!\\!\\!\\!-0.4\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\!\\!\\!\\left[x_{1}\\right]\\!\\!\\!\\right]+\\left[\\!\\!\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{0.8}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]u}\\\\ {y=[0\\!\\!\\!\\!}&{{}\\!\\!\\!\\!1]\\!\\!\\left[\\!\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\!\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nShow that the state-space representation given by Equations (9–120) and (9–121) gives a system that is state controllable,but not observable.Show,on the other hand,that the state-space representation defined by Equations (9–122) and (9–123) gives a system that is not completely state controllable, but is observable. Explain what causes the apparent difference in the controllability and observability of the same system.  \n\nSolution. Consider the system defined by Equations (9–120) and (9–121). The rank of the controllability matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{B}\\;\\;\\vdots\\;\\;\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{-1.3\\rfloor}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nis 2. Hence, the system is completely state controllable.The rank of the observability matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}]=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0.8}&{-0.4}\\\\ {1}&{-0.5}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nis 1. Hence the system is not observable.  \n\nNext consider the system defined by Equations (9–122) and (9–123). The rank of the controllability matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{B}\\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0.8}&{-0.4}\\\\ {1}&{-0.5}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nis 1. Hence, the system is not completely state controllable.The rank of the observability matrix  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{-1.3{\\underline{{\\,}}}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nis 2. Hence, the system is observable.  \n\nThe apparent difference in the controllability and observability of the same system is caused by the fact that the original system has a pole-zero cancellation in the transfer function. Referring to Equation (2–29), for $D=0$ we have  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,{\\bf C}(s{\\bf I}\\,-\\,{\\bf A})^{-1}{\\bf B}\n$$  \n\nIf we use Equations (9–120) and (9–121), then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{G(s)=[0.8}&{1]\\!\\!\\left[\\!\\!\\left[{\\begin{array}{l l l}{s}&{-1}&{\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!-1}\\\\ {0.4}&{s+1.3}\\end{array}}\\right]^{\\!\\!\\!-1}\\!\\!\\left[{\\frac{0}{1}}\\right]\\!\\!\\right]}\\\\ {={\\cfrac{1}{s^{2}+1.3s+0.4}}\\left[\\!\\!\\left[\\!\\!\\left[{\\begin{array}{l l l}{s+1.3}&{\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!-1}&{\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!1}\\\\ {-0.4}&{s}\\end{array}}\\right]\\!\\!\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\!\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}}\\!\\!\\!\\right]}\\\\ {={\\cfrac{s+\\ 0.8}{(s+0.8)(s+0.5)}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n[Note that the same transfer function can be obtained by using Equations (9–122) and (9–123).] Clearly, cancellation occurs in this transfer function.  \n\nIf a pole-zero cancellation occurs in the transfer function,then the controllability and observability vary, depending on how the state variables are chosen. Remember that, to be completely state controllable and observable, the transfer function must not have any pole-zero cancellations.  \n\nA–9–18.

We shall first obtain the necessary condition. Suppose that  \n\n$$\n:\\mathbf{P}<n\n$$  \n\nThen there exists ${\\bf x}(0)$ such that  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\mathbf{C}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}}\\end{array}\\right]\\mathbf{x}(0)=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}(0)}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}(0)}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\mathbf{x}(0)}\\end{array}\\right]=\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nHence, we obtain, for a certain ${\\bf x}(0)$ ,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{CA}^{i}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,i=0,1,2,\\dots,n\\,-\\,1\n$$  \n\nNotice that from Equation (9–48) or (9–50), we have  \n\n$$\ne^{\\mathbf{A}t}=\\alpha_{0}(t)\\mathbf{I}+\\alpha_{1}(t)\\mathbf{A}+\\alpha_{2}(t)\\mathbf{A}^{2}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{m-1}(t)\\mathbf{A}^{m-1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $m(m\\leq n)$ is the degree of the minimal polynomial for A .Hence,for a certain ${\\bf x}(0)$ ,we have  \n\n$$\n{\\bf C}e^{{\\bf A}t}{\\bf x}(0)={\\bf C}\\big[\\alpha_{0}(t){\\bf I}+\\,\\alpha_{1}(t){\\bf A}\\,+\\,\\alpha_{2}(t){\\bf A}^{2}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,\\alpha_{m-1}(t)\\,{\\bf A}^{m-1}\\big]{\\bf x}(0)={\\bf0}\n$$  \n\nConsequently, for a certain ${\\bf x}(0)$ ,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nwhich implies that, for a certain ${\\bf x}(0),{\\bf x}(0)$ cannot be determined from ${\\bf y}(t)$ . Therefore, the rank of matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ must be equal to $n$ .  \n\nNext we shall obtain the sufficient condition. Suppose that rank $\\mathbf{P}=n$ . Since  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\n$$  \n\nby premultiplying both sides of this last equation by $e^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}t}\\mathbf{C}^{*}$ , we get  \n\n$$\ne^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}t}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,=\\,e^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}t}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\n$$  \n\nIf we integrate this last equation from 0 to $t$ , we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t}e^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}t}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,d t=\\ \\int_{0}^{t}e^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}t}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\,d t\n$$  \n\nNotice that the left-hand side of this equation is a known quantity. Define  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}(t)\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{t}\\!e^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}t}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{y}(t)\\,d t={\\mathrm{known~quantity}}\n$$  \n\nThen, from Equations (9–124) and (9–125), we have  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}(t)=\\mathbf{W}(t)\\mathbf{x}(0)\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}(t)\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{t}\\!e^{\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\tau}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}\\tau}\\,d\\tau\n$$  \n\nIt can be established that $\\mathbf{W}(t)$ is a nonsingular matrix as follows: If $\\left|\\mathbf{W}(t)\\right|$ were equal to 0, then  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}^{*}\\mathbf{W}\\!\\left(t_{1}\\right)\\!\\mathbf{x}\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{t_{1}}\\!\\|\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2}\\,d t=0\n$$  \n\nwhich means that  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}e^{\\mathbf{A}t}\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\ 0\\leq t\\leq t_{1}\n$$  \n\nwhich implies that rank $\\mathbb{P}<n$ . Therefore, $\\left|\\mathbf{W}(t)\\right|\\neq0$ , or $\\mathbf{W}(t)$ is nonsingular.

We then discuss the design of state observers, followed by the design of regulator systems and control systems using the pole-placement-with-state-observer approach.Then, we discuss the quadratic optimal regulator systems. Finally, we present an introduction to robust control systems.  \n\nOutline of the Chapter. Section 10–1 has presented introductory material.Section 10–2 discusses the pole-placement approach to the design of control systems. We begin with the derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for arbitrary pole placement. Then we derive equations for the state feedback gain matrix Kfor pole placement.Section 10–3 presents the solution of the pole-placement problem with MATLAB. Section 10–4 discusses the design of servo systems using the pole-placement approach. Section 10–5 presents state observers.We discuss both full-order and minimum-order state observers. Also, transfer functions of observer controllers are derived. Section 10–6 presents the design of regulator systems with observers. Section 10–7 treats the design of control systems with observers.Section 10–8 discusses quadratic optimal regulator systems.Note that the state feedback gain matrix Kcan be obtained by both the pole-placement method and the quadratic optimal control method. Finally, Section 10–9 presents robust control systems.The discussions here are limited to introductory subjects only.  \n\nIn this section we shall present a design method commonly called the pole-placement or pole-assignment technique. We assume that all state variables are measurable and are available for feedback. It will be shown that if the system considered is completely state controllable, then poles of the closed-loop system may be placed at any desired locations by means of state feedback through an appropriate state feedback gain matrix.  \n\nThe present design technique begins with a determination of the desired closed-loop poles based on the transient-response and/or frequency-response requirements, such as speed, damping ratio, or bandwidth, as well as steady-state requirements.  \n\nLet us assume that we decide that the desired closed-loop poles are to be at $s=\\mu_{1}$ ,$s\\,=\\,\\mu_{2},\\ldots,s\\,=\\,\\mu_{n}.$ .By choosing an appropriate gain matrix for state feedback, it is possible to force the system to have closed-loop poles at the desired locations, provided that the original system is completely state controllable.  \n\nIn this chapter we limit our discussions to single-input, single-output systems. That is, we assume the control signal $u(t)$ and output signal $y(t)$ to be scalars. In the derivation in this section we assume that the reference input $r(t)$ is zero. [In Section 10–7 we discuss the case where the reference input $r(t)$ is nonzero.]  \n\nIn what follows we shall prove that a necessary and sufficient condition that the closed-loop poles can be placed at any arbitrary locations in the $s$ plane is that the system be completely state controllable. Then we shall discuss methods for determining the required state feedback gain matrix.  \n\nIt is noted that when the control signal is a vector quantity, the mathematical aspects of the pole-placement scheme become complicated.We shall not discuss such a case in this book. (When the control signal is a vector quantity, the state feedback gain matrix is not unique. It is possible to choose freely more than $n$ parameters; that is, in addition to being able to place nclosed-loop poles properly, we have the freedom to satisfy some or all of the other requirements, if any, of the closed-loop system.)  \n\nDesign by Pole Placement. In the conventional approach to the design of a singleinput, single-output control system, we design a controller (compensator) such that the dominant closed-loop poles have a desired damping ratio $\\zeta$ and a desired undamped natural frequency $\\omega_{n}$ .In this approach, the order of the system may be raised by 1 or 2 unless pole–zero cancellation takes place. Note that in this approach we assume the effects on the responses of nondominant closed-loop poles to be negligible.  \n\nDifferent from specifying only dominant closed-loop poles (the conventional design approach), the present pole-placement approach specifies all closed-loop poles. (There is a cost associated with placing all closed-loop poles, however, because placing all closedloop poles requires successful measurements of all state variables or else requires the inclusion of a state observer in the system.) There is also a requirement on the part of the system for the closed-loop poles to be placed at arbitrarily chosen locations.The requirement is that the system be completely state controllable.We shall prove this fact in this section.  \n\nConsider a control system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {y\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,D u}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}=$ state vector ($n$ -vector ) $y=$ output signal(scalar)$u=$ control signal (scalar )$\\mathbf{A}=n\\times n$ constant matrix $\\mathbf{B}\\,=\\,n\\,\\times\\,1$ constant matrix $\\mathbf{C}=1\\times n$ constant matrix  $D=$ constant(scalar)  \n\nWe shall choose the control signal to be  \n\n$$\nu\\,=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nThis means that the control signal $u$ is determined by an instantaneous state. Such a scheme is called state feedback. The $1\\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is called the state feedback gain matrix. We assume that all state variables are available for feedback. In the following analysis we assume that $u$ is unconstrained.A block diagram for this system is shown in Figure 10–1.  \n\nThis closed-loop system has no input. Its objective is to maintain the zero output. Because of the disturbances that may be present, the output will deviate from zero.The nonzero output will be returned to the zero reference input because of the state feedback scheme of the system. Such a system where the reference input is always zero is called a regulator system. (Note that if the reference input to the system is always a nonzero constant, the system is also called a regulator system.)  \n\nSubstituting Equation (10–2) into Equation (10–1) gives  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(t)\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}(t)\n$$  \n\nThe solution of this equation is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,=\\,e^{(\\mathbf{A-BK})t}\\mathbf{x}(0)\n$$  \n\nwhere ${\\bf x}(0)$ is the initial state caused by external disturbances.The stability and transientresponse characteristics are determined by the eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ . If matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is chosen properly, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ can be made an asymptotically stable matrix, and for all $\\mathbf{x}(0)\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ , it is possible to make ${\\bf x}(t)$ approach 0 as $t$ approaches infinity.The eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ are called the regulator poles.If these regulator poles are placed in the left-half $s$ plane, then ${\\bf x}(t)$ approaches 0 as $t$ approaches infinity.The problem of placing the regulator poles (closed-loop poles) at the desired location is called a pole-placement problem.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through various components, likely representing a control system or signal processing circuit. The diagram is divided into two sections: the top section and the bottom section.\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n* A single input signal labeled \"u\" enters from the left side.\n* The signal passes through a box labeled \"B,\" which contains an unknown operation or function.\n* The output of Box B then flows into another box, denoted as \"D.\"\n* From Box D, two signals emerge:\n\t+ One signal is directed to the right and passes through a box labeled \"-K\" before exiting the diagram.\n\t+ The other signal splits into two branches:\n\t\t- One branch goes upward and enters a box marked \"S,\" which likely represents some form of processing or transformation.\n\t\t- The second branch flows downward and combines with another signal from the bottom section.\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n* Two input signals enter from below, one labeled \"x\" and the other unlabeled.\n* The unlabeled signal passes through a box marked \"C,\" while the signal labeled \"x\" goes into a box denoted as \"-K.\"\n* Both outputs then flow upward:\n\t+ One output continues on its path to combine with the upper branch's signal, forming a single output that exits the diagram.\n\t+ The other output merges with the lower branch of the top section's signal, effectively combining all signals before they exit the system.\n\nIn summary, this block diagram illustrates the sequential processing and combination of input signals through various components (B, D, S, C), ultimately producing an output signal. The exact nature of these components or their specific functions is not explicitly defined within the provided image but can be inferred based on typical control system or signal processing applications. 10–1 Closed-loop control system with $u\\,=\\,-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}$ .  \n\nIn what follows, we shall prove that arbitrary pole placement for a given system is possible if and only if the system is completely state controllable.  \n\nNecessary and Sufficient Condition for Arbitrary Pole Placement We shall now prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for arbitrary pole placement is that the system be completely state controllable.We shall first derive the necessary condition.We begin by proving that if the system is not completely state controllable, then there are eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ that cannot be controlled by state feedback.  \n\nSuppose that the system of Equation (10–1) is not completely state controllable. Then the rank of the controllability matrix is less than $n$ ,or  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname{rank}[\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{\\Pi}\\mid\\mathbf{\\DeltaA}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{\\Pi}\\mid\\mathbf{\\cdots}\\mid\\mathbf{\\DeltaA}^{n-1}\\mathbf{B}]=q<n\n$$  \n\nThis means that there are $q$ linearly independent column vectors in the controllability matrix. Let us define such $q$ linearly independent column vectors as $\\mathbf{f}_{1},\\mathbf{f}_{2},\\ldots,\\mathbf{f}_{q}$ .Also, let us choose $n\\mathrm{~-~}q$ additional $n$ -vectors $\\mathbf{\\Delta}\\mathbf{v}_{q}+\\mathbf{}1,\\,\\mathbf{v}_{q}+2,\\,\\dots,\\,\\mathbf{v}_{n}$ such that  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}=\\left[\\mathbf{f}_{1}\\ \\ \\vdots\\ \\mathbf{f}_{2}\\ \\ {\\bf:}\\ \\cdots\\ {\\bf:}\\ \\ {\\bf f}_{q}\\ \\ {\\bf:}\\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{q+1}\\ \\ {\\bf:}\\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{q+2}\\ \\ {\\bf:}\\ \\ {\\bf\\cdots}\\ \\ {\\bf:}\\ \\ \\mathbf{v}_{n}\\right]\n$$  \n\nis of rank $n$ .Then it can be shown that  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}\\,=\\,\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf{A}_{11}}{\\mathbf{0}\\,}\\,\\boxed{\\mathbf{A}_{12}}\\right],\\qquad\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\,=\\,\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_{11}}{\\mathbf{0}}\\right]\n$$  \n\n(See Problem A–10–1 for the derivation of these equations.) Now define  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}=\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{P}=\\left[\\mathbf{k}_{1}\\;\\vdots\\;\\mathbf{k}_{2}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThen we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}{s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}]=\\left|\\mathbf{P}^{-1}(s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{P}\\right|}\\\\ {=\\left|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{P}+\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\right|}\\\\ {=\\left|s\\mathbf{I}-\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}\\right|}\\\\ {=\\left|s\\mathbf{I}-\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf{A}_{11}}{\\mathbf{\\Lambda}}\\right]\\mathbf{A}_{12}\\right|+\\left[\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_{11}}{\\mathbf{\\Lambda}}\\right]\\!\\!\\left[\\mathbf{k}_{1}\\!\\!\\right]\\!\\!}&{{}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}_{q}$ is a $q$ -dimensional identity matrix and $\\mathbf{I}_{n\\mathrm{~-~}q}$ is an $(n\\mathrm{~-~}q)$ -dimensional identity matrix.  \n\nNotice that the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}_{22}$ do not depend on K. Thus, if the system is not completely state controllable, then there are eigenvalues of matrix A that cannot be arbitrarily placed.Therefore, to place the eigenvalues of matrix A -BK arbitrarily, the system must be completely state controllable (necessary condition).  \n\nNext we shall prove a sufficient condition: that is, if the system is completely state controllable, then all eigenvalues of matrix A can be arbitrarily placed.  \n\nIn proving a sufficient condition, it is convenient to transform the state equation given by Equation (10–1) into the controllable canonical form.  \n\nDefine a transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{W}\n$$  \n\nwhere Mis the controllability matrix  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{\\begin{array}{l}{\\vdots}\\\\ {\\vdots}\\end{array}}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{\\begin{array}{l}{\\vdots}\\end{array}}\\cdots\\mathbf{\\begin{array}{l}{\\vdots}\\end{array}}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\mathbf{B}\\right]\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{a_{n-1}}&{a_{n-2}}&{\\cdots}&{a_{1}}&{1}\\\\ {a_{n-2}}&{a_{n-3}}&{\\cdots}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}&{\\cdot}&{}&{\\cdot}&{\\cdot}\\\\ {a_{1}}&{1}&{\\cdots}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nwhere the $a_{i}$ ’s are coefficients of the characteristic polynomial  \n\n$$\n|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}|\\,=\\,s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}\n$$  \n\nDefine a new state vector $\\hat{\\bf x}$ by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$  \n\nIf the rank of the controllability matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is $n$ (meaning that the system is completely state controllable), then the inverse of matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ exists, and Equation (10–1) can be modified to  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\dot{\\hat{x}}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}\\hat{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}u\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c c}{0}&{1}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}&{\\cdots}&{0}\\\\ {.}&{.}&{.}&{}&{.}\\\\ {.}&{.}&{.}&{}&{.}\\\\ {.}&{.}&{.}&{}&{.}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{1}\\\\ {-a_{n}}&{-a_{n-1}}&{-a_{n-2}}&{\\cdots}&{-a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\n[See Problems A–10–2 and A–10–3 for the derivation of Equations (10–8) and (10–9).] Equation (10–7) is in the controllable canonical form.Thus,given a state equation,Equation (10–1), it can be transformed into the controllable canonical form if the system is completely state controllable and if we transform the state vector $\\mathbf{X}$ into state vector $\\hat{\\bf x}$ by use of the transformation matrix Tgiven by Equation (10–4).  \n\nLet us choose a set of the desired eigenvalues as $\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},\\ldots,\\mu_{n}$ .Then the desired characteristic equation becomes  \n\n$$\n(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})\\cdots(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{n})\\,=\\,s^{n}\\,+\\,\\alpha_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,\\alpha_{n-1}s\\,+\\,\\alpha_{n}=0\n$$  \n\nLet us write  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{KT}\\,=\\,\\left[\\delta_{n}\\quad\\delta_{n-1}\\quad\\cdots\\quad\\delta_{1}\\right]\n$$  \n\nWhen $u=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is used to control the system given by Equation (10–7), the system equation becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$  \n\nThe characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{T}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{T}\\right|\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThis characteristic equation is the same as the characteristic equation for the system, defined by Equation (10–1), when $u\\,=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}$ is used as the control signal.

If the system is completely state controllable, then use the following steps:  \n\nStep 2: From the characteristic polynomial for matrix A , that is,  \n\n$$\n|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}|\\,=\\,s^{n}\\,+\\,a_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{n-1}s\\,+\\,a_{n}\n$$  \n\ndetermine the values of $a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots,a_{n}$ .  \n\nStep 3: Determine the transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ that transforms the system state equation into the controllable canonical form. (If the given system equation is already in the controllable canonical form, then $\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{I},$ ) It is not necessary to write the state equation in the controllable canonical form. All we need here is to find the matrix T. The transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ is given by Equation (10–4), or  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{W}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{M}$ is given by Equation (10–5) and $\\mathbf{W}$ is given by Equation (10–6).  \n\nStep 4: Using the desired eigenvalues (desired closed-loop poles), write the desired characteristic polynomial:  \n\n$$\n(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})\\cdots(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{n})=\\,s^{n}\\,+\\,\\alpha_{1}s^{n-1}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,\\alpha_{n-1}s\\,+\\,\\alpha_{n}\n$$  \n\nand determine the values of $\\alpha_{1},\\alpha_{2},\\ldots,\\alpha_{n}$ .  \n\nStep 5: The required state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ can be determined from Equation (10–13), rewritten thus:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}={\\left[\\alpha_{n}\\,-\\,a_{n}\\,\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,\\,}\\alpha_{n-1}\\,-\\,a_{n-1}\\,\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,\\cdots\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,\\,\\alpha_{2}\\,-\\,a_{2}\\,\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,\\,\\alpha_{1}\\,-\\,a_{1}\\right]}\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\n$$  \n\nDetermination of Matrix K Using Direct Substitution Method. If the system is of low order $(n\\leq3)$ ), direct substitution of matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ into the desired characteristic polynomial may be simpler. For example, if $n\\,=\\,3$ ,then write the state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ as  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=\\left[k_{1}\\quad k_{2}\\quad k_{3}\\right]\n$$  \n\nSubstitute this $\\mathbf{K}$ matrix into the desired characteristic polynomial $\\lvert s\\mathbf{I}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{A}\\mathrm{~+~}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\rvert$ and equate it to $(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{3})$ , or  \n\n$$\n|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}|\\,=\\,(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{3})\n$$  \n\nSince both sides of this characteristic equation are polynomials in $s$ ,by equating the coefficients of the like powers of $s$ on both sides, it is possible to determine the values of $k_{1},k_{2}$ ,and $k_{3}$ .This approach is convenient if $n\\,=\\,2$ or 3. (For $n=4,5,6,\\ldots,$ , this approach may become very tedious.)  \n\nNote that if the system is not completely controllable,matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ cannot be determined. (No solution exists.)  \n\nDetermination of Matrix K Using Ackermann’s Formula. There is a well-known formula, known as Ackermann’s formula, for the determination of the state feedback gain matrix K.We shall present this formula in what follows.  \n\nConsider the system  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{\\delta}\\mathbf{B}u\n$$  \n\nwhere we use the state feedback control $u\\,=\\,-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}$ . We assume that the system is completely state controllable.We also assume that the desired closed-loop poles are at $s\\,=\\,\\mu_{1},s\\,=\\,\\mu_{2},...\\,,s\\,=\\,\\mu_{n}$ .  \n\nUse of the state feedback control  \n\n$$\nu\\,=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nmodifies the system equation to  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nLet us define  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\bf A}={\\bf A}-{\\bf B}{\\bf K}\n$$  \n\nThe desired characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}|=|s\\mathbf{I}-{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}}|=(s-\\mu_{1})(s-\\mu_{2})\\cdots(s-\\mu_{n})}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad=s^{n}+\\alpha_{1}s^{n-1}+\\cdots+\\alpha_{n-1}s\\,+\\,\\alpha_{n}=0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nSince the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that $\\widetilde{\\bf A}$ satisfies its own characteristic equation, we have  \n\n$$\n\\phi(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}})=\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}^{n}+\\,\\alpha_{1}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}^{n-1}+\\dots+\\,\\alpha_{n-1}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}\\,+\\,\\alpha_{n}\\mathbf{I}=\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nWe shall utilize Equation (10–15) to derive Ackermann’s formula. To simplify the derivation, we consider the case where $n\\,=\\,3$ .(For any other positive integer $n$ ,the following derivation can be easily extended.)  \n\nConsider the following identities:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{I}=\\mathbf{I}}\\\\ &{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}=\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}}\\\\

Systems and Control Systems. Systems that include controllers can be divided into two categories: regulator systems (where the reference input is constant, including zero) and control systems (where the reference input is time varying). In what follows we shall consider regulator systems. Control systems will be treated in Section 10–7.  \n\nChoosing the Locations of Desired Closed-Loop Poles. The first step in the pole-placement design approach is to choose the locations of the desired closed-loop poles.The most frequently used approach is to choose such poles based on experience in the root-locus design,placing a dominant pair of closed-loop poles and choosing other poles so that they are far to the left of the dominant closed-loop poles.  \n\nNote that if we place the dominant closed-loop poles far from the jvaxis, so that the system response becomes very fast, the signals in the system become very large, with the result that the system may become nonlinear.This should be avoided.  \n\nAnother approach is based on the quadratic optimal control approach.This approach will determine the desired closed-loop poles such that it balances between the acceptable response and the amount of control energy required. (See Section 10–8.) Note that requiring a high-speed response implies requiring large amounts of control energy.Also, in general,increasing the speed of response requires a larger,heavier actuator,which will cost more.  \n\nConsider the regulator system shown in Figure 10–2.The plant is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-1}&{-5}&{-6}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nThe system uses the state feedback control $\\mathbf{u}=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}.$ .Let us choose the desired closed-loop poles at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-2\\,+\\,j4,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-2\\,-\\,j4,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-10\n$$  \n\n(We make such a choice because we know from experience that such a set of closed-loop poles will result in a reasonable or acceptable transient response.) Determine the state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ .  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram of a system, comprising various components and their interconnections. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate the flow of signals through the system.\n\n* A box with an arrow pointing into it labeled \"B\":\n\t+ This component represents a processing unit or module within the system.\n\t+ It has an input signal indicated by the arrow pointing into it.\n* An arrow pointing out of the box with a plus sign (+) and a minus sign (-):\n\t+ The plus sign suggests addition or positive operation on the signal.\n\t+ The minus sign indicates subtraction or negative operation on the signal.\n\t+ This combination implies that the output of the block is calculated based on both addition and subtraction operations applied to its input signal.\n* A box with an arrow pointing into it labeled \"A\":\n\t+ Similar to component B, this represents another processing unit within the system.\n\t+ It also has an input signal indicated by the arrow pointing into it.\n* An arrow pointing out of the box with a letter \"u\" and an arrow pointing into it:\n\t+ The presence of the letter \"u\" is unclear in its intended meaning without further context but typically represents uncertainty or a random process in control systems.\n\t+ The input to this component from outside the diagram suggests it could be receiving external information for processing.\n* A box with an arrow pointing into it labeled \"-K\":\n\t+ This block implies some form of scaling or weighting operation on its input signal, indicated by the negative sign (-).\n\t+ The \"K\" inside suggests a gain or coefficient that determines the magnitude of this transformation.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a system composed of several interconnected blocks performing various operations such as addition/subtraction and possibly scaling/weighting. The exact functions of these components are not specified beyond their mathematical representations (addition, subtraction, and possibly multiplication due to the presence of gains), but they collectively form a complex signal processing or control system. 10–2 Regulator system.  \n\nFirst, we need to check the controllability matrix of the system. Since the controllability matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}={\\left[\\mathbf{B}\\begin{array}{l}{\\vdots}\\\\ {\\vdots}\\end{array}\\right]}\\ \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\ \\mid\\ \\mathbf{A}^{2}\\mathbf{B}{\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{1}&{-6}\\\\ {1}&{-6}&{31}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nwe find that $|\\mathbf{M}|=-1$ ,and therefore, rank $\\mathbf{M}=3,$ Thus, the system is completely state controllable and arbitrary pole placement is possible.  \n\nNext, we shall solve this problem.We shall demonstrate each of the three methods presented in this chapter.  \n\nMethod 1: The first method is to use Equation (10–13).The characteristic equation for the system is  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r}{|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|={\\left|\\begin{array}{l l l}{s}&{-1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{\\;s}&{-1}\\\\ {1}&{5}&{s+6}\\end{array}\\right|}}\\\\ {=s^{3}+6s^{2}+5s\\;+1}\\\\ {=s^{3}+a_{1}s^{2}+a_{2}s\\;+\\;a_{3}=0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\na_{1}=6,\\qquad a_{2}=5,\\qquad a_{3}=1\n$$  \n\nThe desired characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{(s\\mathrm{~+~}2\\mathrm{~-~}j4)(s\\mathrm{~+~}2\\mathrm{~+~}j4)(s\\mathrm{~+~}10)\\mathrm{~}=s^{3}\\mathrm{~+~}14s^{2}\\mathrm{~+~}60s\\mathrm{~+~}200}\\\\ {\\mathrm{~=~}s^{3}\\mathrm{~+~}\\alpha_{1}s^{2}\\mathrm{~+~}\\alpha_{2}s\\mathrm{~+~}\\alpha_{3}=0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\alpha_{1}=14,\\qquad\\alpha_{2}=60,\\qquad\\alpha_{3}=200\n$$  \n\nReferring to Equation (10–13), we have  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}={\\left[\\alpha_{3}\\,-\\,a_{3}\\,\\,\\,\\right\\{\\,\\,\\alpha_{2}\\,-\\,a_{2}\\,\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,\\,\\alpha_{1}\\,-\\,a_{1}\\big\\}}\\mathbf{T}^{-1}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{I}$ for this problem because the given state equation is in the controllable canonical form.

If method 2 is used, hand computations become necessary because a computer may not handle the characteristic equation with unknown parameters $k_{1},k_{2},\\ldots,k_{n}$ .  \n\nComments. It is important to note that matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is not unique for a given system, but depends on the desired closed-loop pole locations (which determine the speed and damping of the response) selected. Note that the selection of the desired closed-loop poles or the desired characteristic equation is a compromise between the rapidity of the response of the error vector and the sensitivity to disturbances and measurement noises.That is, if we increase the speed of error response, then the adverse effects of disturbances and measurement noises generally increase. If the system is of second order, then the system dynamics (response characteristics) can be precisely correlated to the location of the desired closed-loop poles and the zero(s) of the plant. For higher-order systems, the location of the closed-loop poles and the system dynamics (response characteristics) are not easily correlated. Hence, in determining the state feedback gain matrix Kfor a given system,it is desirable to examine by computer simulations the response characteristics of the system for several different matrices K(based on several different desired characteristic equations) and to choose the one that gives the best overall system performance.  \n\n# 10–3 SOLVING POLE-PLACEMENT PROBLEMS WITH MATLAB  \n\nPole-placement problems can be solved easily with MATLAB. MATLAB has two commands— acker and place —for the computation of feedback-gain matrix K.The command acker is based on Ackermann’s formula.This command applies to single-input systems only.The desired closed-loop poles can include multiple poles (poles located at the same place).  \n\nIf the system involves multiple inputs, for a specified set of closed-loop poles the state-feedback gain matrix Kis not unique and we have an additional freedom (or freedoms) to choose K.There are many approaches to constructively utilize this additional freedom (or freedoms) to determine K. One common use is to maximize the stability margin.The pole placement based on this approach is called the robust pole placement. The MATLAB command for the robust pole placement is place .  \n\nAlthough the command place can be used for both single-input and multiple-input systems, this command requires that the multiplicity of poles in the desired closed-loop poles be no greater than the rank of B. That is, if matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ is an $n\\times1$ matrix, the command place requires that there be no multiple poles in the set of desired closedloop poles.  \n\nFor single-input systems, the commands acker and place yield the same K. (But for multiple-input systems, one must use the command place instead of acker .)  \n\nIt is noted that when the single-input system is barely controllable, some computational problem may occur if the command acker is used. In such a case the use of the place command is preferred, provided that no multiple poles are involved in the desired set of closed-loop poles.  \n\nTo use the command acker or place , we first enter the following matrices in the program:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}\\;\\mathrm{matrix},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}\\;\\mathrm{matrix},\\qquad\\mathbf{J}\\;\\mathrm{matrix}\n$$  \n\nwhere Jmatrix is the matrix consisting of the desired closed-loop poles such that  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}=\\left[\\mu_{1}\\quad\\mu_{2}\\quad\\ldots\\quad\\mu_{n}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThen we enter  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{K}=\\mathsf{a c k e r}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{J})\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{K}=\\mathsf{p l a c e}(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{J})\n$$  \n\nIt is noted that the command eig $(\\mathsf{A}\\!-\\!\\mathsf{B}^{*}\\mathsf{K})$ may be used to verify that Kthus obtained gives the desired eigenvalues.  \n\nEXAMPLE 10–2 Consider the same system as treated in Example 10–1.The system equation is  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-1}&{-5}&{-6}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nBy using state feedback control $u\\,=\\,-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}.$ ,it is desired to have the closed-loop poles at $s=\\mu_{i}$ $(i=1,2,3)$ ), where  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{1}=-2\\,+\\,j4,\\qquad\\mu_{2}=-2\\,-\\,j4,\\qquad\\mu_{3}=-10\n$$  \n\nDetermine the state feedback-gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ with MATLAB.  \n\nMATLAB programs that generate matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ are shown in MATLAB Programs 10–1 and 10–2.

The diagram provides valuable information for understanding the behavior of these state variables in response to changes in their initial conditions.  \n\nIn this section we shall discuss the pole-placement approach to the design of type 1 servo systems. Here we shall limit our systems each to have a scalar control signal $u$ and a scalar output y.  \n\nIn what follows we shall first discuss a problem of designing a type 1 servo system when the plant involves an integrator.Then we shall discuss the design of a type 1 servo system when the plant has no integrator.  \n\nDesign of Type 1 Servo System when the Plant Has An Integrator. Assume that the plant is defined by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad}\\\\ {y\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}=$ state vector for the plant ($n$ -vector )  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{u=\\mathrm{control~signal~(scalar)}}\\\\ &{y=\\mathrm{output~signal~(scalar)}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{A}=n\\times n\\,\\mathrm{constant~matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{B}=n\\times1\\,\\mathrm{constant~matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{C}=1\\times n\\,\\mathrm{constant~matrix}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAs stated earlier, we assume that both the control signal scalars. By a proper choice of a set of state variables, it is possible to choose the output A $u$ and the output signal $y$ are obtaining a state-space representation of the transfer function system in which the output o be equal to one the state variables. BSee the method presented in Chapter 2 for $y$ becomes equal to $x_{1}$ .  \n\nFigure 10–4 shows a general configuration of the type 1 servo system when the plant has an integrator. Here we assumed that $y\\,=\\,x_{1}$ .In the present analysis we assume that  \n\nThe image presents a complex system of interconnected boxes and arrows, likely representing a control or feedback loop. The purpose of the image is to illustrate the relationships between various components within this system.\n\n* Arrows:\n\t+ Pointing from left to right\n\t+ Indicate flow or direction of influence\n\t+ Some arrows are solid, while others are dotted or dashed\n* Boxes:\n\t+ Rectangular in shape\n\t+ Contain text labels and mathematical symbols\n\t+ Range in size from small to large\n\t+ Some boxes have multiple inputs or outputs, represented by additional arrows\n* Text labels:\n\t+ Appear inside the boxes\n\t+ Use a combination of letters (e.g., \"r\", \"u\") and symbols (e.g., \"+\", \"-\")\n\t+ May represent variables, constants, or operators\n\nThe image suggests that the system is designed to process inputs and produce outputs based on complex relationships between its components. The use of arrows and boxes implies a hierarchical structure, with some components influencing others in a sequential manner. 10–4 Type 1 servo system when the plant has an integrator.  \n\nthe reference input $r$ is a step function.In this system we use the following state-feedback control scheme:  \n\n$$\nu=-{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{0}&{k_{2}}&{k_{3}}&{\\cdots}&{k_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {x_{n}}\\end{array}\\right]}+k_{1}(r\\,-\\,x_{1})\n$$  \n\n$$\n{\\bf\\alpha}=-{\\bf K}{\\bf x}\\,+\\,k_{1}r\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=\\left[k_{1}\\quad k_{2}\\ \\cdots\\ k_{n}\\right]\n$$  \n\nAssume that the reference input (step function) is applied at $t\\,=\\,0$ .Then, for $t>0$ ,the system dynamics can be described by Equations (10–19) and (10–21), or  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u=(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}k_{1}r\n$$  \n\nWe shall design the type 1 servo system such that the closed-loop poles are located at desired positions. The designed system will be an asymptotically stable system, $y(\\infty)$ will approach the constant value $r$ , and $u(\\infty)$ will approach zero. ( $r$ is a step input.)  \n\nNotice that at steady state we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(\\infty)\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}k_{1}r(\\infty)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNoting that $r(t)$ is a step input, we have $r(\\infty)\\,=\\,r(t)\\,=\\,r(\\mathrm{constant})$ ) for $t\\,>\\,0$ .By subtracting Equation (10–23) from Equation (10–22), we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}(t)\\,-\\,{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}(\\infty)=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\big[\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,-\\,\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\big]\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,-\\,\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{e}(t)\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (10–24) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{e}\n$$  \n\nEquation (10–25) describes the error dynamics.  \n\nThe design of the type 1 servo system here is converted to the design of an asymptotically stable regulator system such that $\\mathbf{e}(t)$ approaches zero, given any initial condition ${\\bf e}(0)$ .If the system defined by Equation (10–19) is completely state controllable, then, by specifying the desired eigenvalues $\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},\\dots,\\mu_{n}$ for the matrix A -BK , matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ can be determined by the pole-placement technique presented in Section 10–2.  \n\nThe steady-state values of ${\\bf x}(t)$ and $u(t)$ can be found as follows: At steady state ($\\mathbf{\\chi}_{t}=\\infty,$ ), we have, from Equation (10–22),  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}(\\infty)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}k_{1}r\n$$  \n\nSince the desired eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ are all in the left-half $s$ plane, the inverse of matrix A -BK exists. Consequently, $\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)$ can be determined as  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,=-(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}k_{1}r\n$$  \n\nAlso, $u(\\infty)$ can be obtained as  \n\n$$\nu(\\infty)\\,=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,+\\,k_{1}r\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\n(See Example 10–4 to verify this last equation.)  \n\n# EXAMPLE 10–4  \n\nDesign a type 1 servo system when the plant transfer function has an integrator.Assume that the plant transfer function is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{1}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}\n$$  \n\nThe desired closed-loop poles are $s\\,=\\,-2\\,\\pm\\,j2\\sqrt{3}$ and $s=-10$ .Assume that the system configuration is the same as that shown in Figure 10–4 and the reference input $r$ is a step function. Obtain the unit-step response of the designed system.  \n\nDefine state variables $x_{1},x_{2}$ ,and $x_{3}$ as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}=y}\\\\ {\\qquad x_{2}=\\dot{x}_{1}}\\\\ {\\qquad x_{3}=\\dot{x}_{2}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen the state-space representation of the system becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{\\beta}}\\\\ {y\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{-2}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{C}=[1}&{0}&{0]\n$$  \n\nReferring to Figure 10–4 and noting that $n\\,=\\,3$ ,the control signal $u$ is given by  \n\n$$\nu\\,=-\\big(k_{2}\\,x_{2}\\,+\\,k_{3}\\,x_{3}\\big)\\,+\\,k_{1}\\big(r\\,-\\,x_{1}\\big)\\,=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,k_{1}r\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=\\left[k_{1}\\quad k_{2}\\quad k_{3}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThe state-feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ can be obtained easily with MATLAB. See MATLAB Program 10–4.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program, which is a high-level programming language primarily used for numerical computation and data analysis.

Without additional context or explanation of what each part is intended to accomplish, it's challenging to provide further insight into the specific functionality of this code snippet.  \n\nThe state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is thus  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{K}=[1\\,60\\;\\;54\\;\\;11]\n$$  \n\nUnit-Step Response of the Designed System: The unit-step response of the designed system can be obtained as follows:  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}\\-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{-2}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right]}-{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}[160}&{54}&{11]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-160}&{-56}&{-14}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nfrom Equation (10–22) the state equation for the designed system is  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{\\dot{x}}_{1}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{2}}\\\\ {{\\dot{x}}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{\\;\\;0}&{\\;\\;1}&{\\;\\;0}\\\\ {\\;\\;0}&{\\;\\;0}&{\\;\\;1}\\\\ {-160}&{-56}&{-14}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{{x}_{1}}\\\\ {{x}_{2}}\\\\ {{x}_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}+{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\;\\;0}\\\\ {\\;\\;0}\\\\ {\\;\\;160}\\end{array}\\right]}r\n$$  \n\nand the output equation is  \n\n$$\ny=[1\\quad0\\quad0]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\\\ {x_{2}}\\\\ {x_{3}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nSolving Equations (10–29) and (10–30) for $y(t)$ when $r$ is a unit-step function gives the unit-step response curve $y(t)$ versus $t$ .MATLAB Program 10–5 yields the unit-step response. The resulting unit-step response curve is shown in Figure 10–5.  \n\n# MATLAB Program 10–5  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for a unit-step response. The program is written in a text-based format and includes several lines of code that define the system's parameters, initialize variables, and simulate the response.\n\nHere are the details of the program:\n\n*   **Title**: The title of the program is \"MATLAB Program 10-5\".\n*   **Variables**:\n    *   `AA`, `BB`, `CC`, and `DD` represent the state-space matrices of the system.\n    *   `t` represents time, which ranges from 0 to 5 seconds.\n    *   `y` represents the output signal.\n*   **Code**:\n\n    The code consists of several lines that define the system's parameters and simulate its response. Here is a breakdown of each line:\n\n        *   `% --- Unit-step response ---%`: This line marks the beginning of the unit-step response section.\n\n        *   `t = 0:0.01:5;`: This line initializes an array `t` with values ranging from 0 to 5 seconds in increments of 0.01 seconds.\n\n        *   `y = step(AA,BB,CC,DD,t);`: This line simulates the response of the system using the `step()` function, which takes as inputs the state-space matrices `AA`, `BB`, `CC`, and `DD`, as well as the time array `t`. The output is stored in the variable `y`.\n\n        *   `plot(t,y)`: This line plots the output signal `y` against time.\n\n    Note that some lines of code have been omitted for brevity. Overall, this program simulates a unit-step response using MATLAB's built-in functions and visualizes the result.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a single black line, set against a white background. The x-axis is labeled \"t Sec\" and features tick marks at 0.5-second intervals from 0 to 5 seconds. Conversely, the y-axis is labeled \"Output y\" and displays tick marks ranging from 0 to 1.2 in increments of 0.2.\n\nThe graph's title is not explicitly stated; however, based on the axis labels, it can be inferred that the graph represents a temporal progression of an output value over time. The line itself exhibits a smooth, continuous curve, characterized by:\n\n*   A gradual increase in output from approximately 0 to 1 during the initial seconds\n*   A brief plateau around 1\n*   A subsequent decrease to around 0.8-0.9 before stabilizing at approximately 1\n\nThe graph's overall appearance suggests a controlled or regulated process, with the output value oscillating within a narrow range over time. 10–5 Unit-step response curve $y(t)$ versus $t$ for the system designed in Example 10–4.  \n\nNote that since  \n\n$$\nu(\\infty)=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,+\\,k_{1}r(\\infty)\\,=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,+\\,k_{1}r\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{u(\\infty)=-[160}&{54}&{11]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}(\\infty)}\\\\ {x_{2}(\\infty)}\\\\ {x_{3}(\\infty)}\\end{array}\\right]}+160r}\\\\ {=-[160}&{54}&{11]{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{r}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}+160r=0}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nAt steady state the control signal $u$ becomes zero.  \n\nDesign of Type 1 Servo System when the Plant Has No Integrator. If the plant has no integrator (type 0 plant), the basic principle of the design of a type 1 servo system is to insert an integrator in the feedforward path between the error comparator and the plant, as shown in Figure 10–6. (The block diagram of Figure 10–6 is a basic form of the type 1 servo system where the plant has no integrator.) From the diagram, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {y=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\\\ {u=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}+k_{I}\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\\\ {\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}=r-y=r-\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{X}=$ state vector of the plant ($n$ -vector )  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of transforming an input signal into an output signal. The chart is divided into two sections, with the top section depicting the transformation of the input signal and the bottom section showing how this transformation affects the overall system.\n\n*   **Top Section:**\n    *   The top section begins with the symbol \"r\" on the left side, indicating the input signal.\n    *   A vertical arrow connects \"r\" to a box labeled \"ξ\", which represents the first stage of processing in the system.\n    *   From \"ξ\", another vertical arrow leads to a box containing the mathematical operation \"f(ξ)\".\n    *   This output is then connected to a box with an arrow pointing downwards, indicating that it is fed into the next stage.\n    *   The final box on this side of the chart has an arrow pointing towards the right edge, signifying that its output contributes to the overall processing of the system.\n*   **Bottom Section:**\n    *   Moving down to the bottom section, we see a series of interconnected boxes and arrows representing different stages in the processing chain.\n    *   The first box on this side is labeled \"A\" and receives an input from above through a horizontal arrow.\n    *   Another vertical arrow connects

If this is the case, we need to use a state observer. Figure 10–7 shows a block diagram of a type 1 servo system with a state observer. [In the figure, each block with an integral symbol represents an integrator $(1/s)$ .] Detailed discussions of state observers are given in Section 10–5.  \n\nConsider the inverted-pendulum control system shown in Figure 10–8. In this example, we are concerned only with the motion of the pendulum and motion of the cart in the plane of the page.  \n\nIt is desired to keep the inverted pendulum upright as much as possible and yet control the position of the cart—for instance, move the cart in a step fashion. To control the position of the cart, we need to build a type 1 servo system. The inverted-pendulum system mounted on a cart does not have an integrator.Therefore, we feed the position signal $y$ (which indicates the position of the cart) back to the input and insert an integrator in the feedforward path, as shown  \n\nFigure 10–8 Inverted-pendulum control system.  \n\nThe image depicts a mechanical system consisting of a mass attached to a pivot, which is itself connected to a cart that can move along a horizontal track. The mass is suspended by an arm with a length labeled \"ℓ\" and has an angle denoted as \"θ\". This setup suggests the presence of a pendulum.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n* **Mass:** Represented by the letter \"m\", this is the object being swung.\n* **Pivot:** Located at point P, it serves as the fixed axis around which the mass rotates.\n* **Arm:** Extends from the pivot to the mass and has a length denoted as \"ℓ\".\n* **Angle:** The angle between the arm and the horizontal plane is labeled as \"θ\".\n* **Cart:** A moving platform that supports the entire structure, allowing it to move horizontally.\n\n**Variables:**\n\n* **x:** Horizontal position of the cart.\n* **θ:** Angle between the arm and the horizontal plane.\n* **m:** Mass attached to the end of the arm.\n* **ℓ:** Length of the arm connecting the mass to the pivot.\n* **P:** Pivot point around which the mass rotates.\n\n**Equations:**\n\nThe equations governing this system are:\n\n* **Kinematics:** The position of the mass can be described using the equations of motion for a pendulum, involving the angles and angular velocities involved.\n* **Dynamics:** Forces acting on the system, such as gravity and possibly an external force applied to the cart, influence its behavior.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThis setup is likely used in physics education or research to study the dynamics of pendulums under various conditions. It may be employed in experiments or simulations to analyze how changes in angle, mass, length, or other parameters affect the motion of the system.\n\n*Answer*: The image represents a mechanical system consisting of a mass attached to a pivot, with an arm connecting it to a cart that can move horizontally.  \n\nThe image presents a complex system diagram, comprising various components and connections. The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top section and the bottom section.\n\n*   **Top Section**\n    *   This section features several blocks with arrows pointing to each other.\n        *   The blocks are labeled as follows:\n            *   $r$\n            *   $\\xi$\n            *   $\\int$\n            *   $k_1$\n            *   $u$\n        *   Arrows connect these blocks, indicating the flow of information or signals between them.\n    *   A circle with an arrow pointing to it is present at the end of this section.\n        *   The circle is labeled as \"x = Ax + Bu\".\n*   **Bottom Section**\n    *   This section consists of several blocks connected by arrows.\n        *   The blocks are labeled as follows:\n            *   $k_1$\n            *   $k_2$\n            *   $k_3$\n            *   $k_4$\n            *   $y = Cx$\n        *   Arrows connect these blocks, representing the flow of information or signals between them.\n    *   A circle with an arrow pointing to it is present at the end of this section.\n        *   The circle is labeled as \"y\".\n\nIn summary, the image depicts a system diagram comprising multiple interconnected components and connections. The top section appears to represent a control system or signal processing mechanism, while the bottom section may be related to data acquisition or output generation. However, without additional context or information about the specific symbols and labels used in the diagram, it is challenging to provide a more detailed explanation of its function or purpose. 10–9 Inverted-pendulum control system.

Referring to Figure 3–6, we started with the force-balance and torque-balance equations and ended up with Equations (3–20) and (3–21) to model the inverted-pendulum system. Referring to Equations (3–20) and (3–21), the equations for the inverted-pendulum control system shown in Figure 10–8 are  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{M{\\ddot{\\theta}}=(M+m)g\\theta-u}}\\\\ {{{M\\ddot{x}}=u-m g\\theta}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWhen the given numerical values are substituted, Equations (10–43) and (10–44) become  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\ddot{\\theta}\\,=\\,20.601\\theta\\,-\\,u}\\\\ {\\ddot{x}\\,=\\,0.5u\\,-\\,0.4905\\theta}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nLet us define the state variables $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}$ ,and $x_{4}$ as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}=\\theta}\\\\ {\\;x_{2}=\\dot{\\theta}}\\\\ {\\;x_{3}=x}\\\\ {\\;x_{4}=\\dot{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen,referring to Equations (10–45) and (10–46) and Figure 10–9 and considering the cart position $x$ as the output of the system, we obtain the equations for the system as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {y=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\\\ {u=-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}+k_{I}\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}\\\\ {\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}=r-y=r-\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l}{\\qquad0}&{1}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {20.601}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {\\qquad0}&{0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {-0.4905}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\qquad0}\\\\ {-1}\\\\ {\\qquad0}\\\\ {0.5}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{C}=[0}&{0}&{1}&{0]\n$$  \n\nFor the type 1 servo system, we have the state error equation as given by Equation (10–40):  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}\\,=\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathbf{e}\\,+\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}u_{e}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n{\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{\\mathbf{A}}&{\\mathbf{0}}\\\\ {-\\mathbf{C}}&{0}\\\\ {-\\mathbf{C}}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {20.601}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {-0.4905}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{-1}&{0}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad{\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {-1}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0.5}\\\\ {0}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nand the control signal is given by Equation (10–41):  \n\n$$\nu_{e}=-\\hat{\\bf K}{\\bf e}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}=\\left[\\mathbf{K}\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,-k_{I}\\right]=\\left[k_{1}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,k_{2}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,k_{3}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,k_{4}\\,\\,\\,\\vdots\\,\\,\\,-k_{I}\\right]\n$$  \n\nexample, the settling time of approximately To obtain a reasonable speed and damping in the response of the designed system (for 1 $4\\sim5$ 1 sec and the maximum overshoot of $15\\%\\sim16\\%$ in the step response of the cart), let us choose the desired closed-loop poles at $s=\\mu_{i}$ $(i=1,2,3,4,5)$ ), where  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{1}=-1\\,+\\,j\\sqrt{3}\\,,\\qquad\\mu_{2}=-1\\,-\\,j\\sqrt{3}\\,,\\qquad\\mu_{3}=-5,\\qquad\\mu_{4}=-5,\\qquad\\mu_{5}=-5\n$$  \n\nWe shall determine the necessary state-feedback gain matrix by the use of MATLAB. Before we proceed further, we must examine the rank of matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ , where  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{\\mathbf{A}}&{\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {-\\mathbf{C}}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nMatrix $\\mathbf{P}$ is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}=\\left[\\mathbf{\\begin{array}{c c c c c c}{\\mathbf{A}}&{\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {-\\mathbf{C}}&{0}\\end{array}}\\right]=\\left[{\\begin{array}{c c c c c c}{0}&{1}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {20.601}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{-1}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {-0.4905}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{0.5}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{-1}&{0}&{0}\\end{array}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThe rank of this matrix can be found to be 5.Therefore, the system defined by Equation (10–51) is completely state controllable, and arbitrary pole placement is possible. MATLAB Program 10–6 produces the state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{\\ddot{K}}$ .  \n\nThis image depicts a MATLAB program that generates an array of numbers and plots it, accompanied by a corresponding legend.\n\nThe program utilizes the array A to plot a series of data points. The top portion of the code defines the array A with the following values: \n\n20.601 0 0\n0 0 1\n\nSubsequently, variables B and C are defined as empty arrays, while J is initialized with an array of three elements: -1 + i*sqrt(3), -1-j*sqrt(3), and -5.\n\nThe code utilizes the plot function to generate a graph, which displays three distinct data points. The first point represents a real number 20.601 on the y-axis and a value at x=0. The second point is a complex number 0+1i, denoted as \"0 + 1j\" in MATLAB. The third point corresponds to -5 on the y-axis. \n\nBelow the graph lies the legend for each data point. At the top of the image are the words 'MATLAB Program 10-6.'  \n\nThus, we get  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=\\left[k_{1}\\quad k_{2}\\quad k_{3}\\quad k_{4}\\right]=\\left[-157.6336\\quad-35.3733\\quad-56.0652\\quad-36.7466\\right]\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\nk_{I}=-50.9684\n$$  \n\nUnit Step-Response Characteristics of the Designed System.

In practice, however, not all state variables are available for feedback. Then we need to estimate unavailable state variables.  \n\nEstimation of unmeasurable state variables is commonly called observation .A device (or a computer program) that estimates or observes the state variables is called a state observer , or simply an observer . If the state observer observes all state variables of the system, regardless of whether some state variables are available for direct measurement, it is called a full-order state observer .There are times when this will not be necessary,when we will need observation of only the unmeasurable state variables, but not of those that are directly measurable as well. For example, since the output variables are observable and they are linearly related to the state variables,we need not observe all state variables, but observe only $n\\,-\\,m$ state variables, where $n$ is the dimension of the state vector and $_m$ is the dimension of the output vector.  \n\nAn observer that estimates fewer than $n$ state variables, where $n$ is the dimension of the state vector, is called a reduced-order state observer or, simply, a reduced-order observer . If the order of the reduced-order state observer is the minimum possible, the observer is called a minimum-order state observer or minimum-order observer . In this section, we shall discuss both the full-order state observer and the minimum-order state observer.  \n\nState Observer. A state observer estimates the state variables based on the measurements of the output and control variables. Here the concept of observability discussed in Section 9–7 plays an important role. As we shall see later, state observers can be designed if and only if the observability condition is satisfied.  \n\nIn the following discussions of state observers, we shall use the notation $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ to designate the observed state vector. In many practical cases, the observed state vector $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ is used in the state feedback to generate the desired control vector.  \n\nConsider the plant defined by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{\\beta}}\\\\ {y\\,=\\,\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe observer is a subsystem to reconstruct the state vector of the plant. The mathematical model of the observer is basically the same as that of the plant, except that we include an additional term that includes the estimation error to compensate for inaccuracies in matrices A and $\\mathbf{B}$ and the lack of the initial error.The estimation error or observation error is the difference between the measured output and the estimated output.The initial error is the difference between the initial state and the initial estimated state.Thus, we define the mathematical model of the observer to be  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\dot{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}}\\ =\\mathbf{A}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\ +\\,\\mathbf{B}u\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}(y\\,-\\,\\mathbf{C}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,)}\\\\ &{\\quad=\\big(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\big)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\ +\\,\\mathbf{B}u\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}y}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ is the estimated state and $\\mathbf{C}\\,\\mathbf{\\widetilde{x}}$ is the estimated output.The inputs to the observer are the output $y$ and the control input $u$ .Matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ , which is called the observer gain matrix, is a weighting matrix to the correction term involving the difference between the measured output $y$ and the estimated output $\\mathbf{C}\\,\\mathbf{\\widetilde{x}}$ .This term continuously corrects the model output and improves the performance of the observer.Figure 10–11 shows the block diagram of the system and the full-order state observer.  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of signal processing, comprising various components and connections. The chart is divided into two main sections: the top section represents the input stage, while the bottom section depicts the output stage.\n\n*   **Input Stage**\n    *   The input stage consists of three inputs:\n        *   **u**: This input represents the original signal that will undergo processing.\n        *   **B**: This input is likely a binary or Boolean value, which may influence the processing of the signal.\n        *   **A**: Similar to B, this input could be a binary or Boolean value affecting the signal's processing.\n    *   The inputs are connected to a series of blocks that perform different operations:\n        *   **Integrator (I)**: This block computes the integral of the input signal u with respect to time.\n        *   **Differentiator (D)**: This block calculates the derivative of the input signal u with respect to time.\n        *   **Multiplier (M)**: This block multiplies the output of the integrator by a constant gain factor K.\n\n*   **Output Stage**\n    *   The output stage consists of two outputs:\n        *   **y**: This output represents the processed signal resulting from the combination of inputs and operations in both stages.\n        *   **x**: This output could represent additional processed signals or intermediate results not directly related to the final output y.\n\n*   **Connections and Operations**\n    *   The blocks within each stage are connected through arrows, indicating data flow between them. For instance:\n        *   The output of the integrator is fed into both the multiplier and the differentiator.\n        *   The output of the differentiator is connected to a block labeled \"C\", which might represent additional processing or filtering.\n    *   Operations performed by each block are denoted within the blocks themselves (e.g., I for Integrator, D for Differentiator).\n\nIn summary, the flowchart illustrates a signal processing system that integrates and differentiates an input signal u based on binary inputs B and A. The processed signals then undergo further transformations involving multiplication and possibly additional processing represented by block C. The outputs from these processes are y (the final processed signal) and x (an intermediate or secondary processed signal). 10–11 Block diagram of system and full-order state observer, when input $u$ and output $y$ are scalars.   \nFull-order state observer  \n\nFull-Order State Observer. The order of the state observer that will be discussed here is the same as that of the plant. Assume that the plant is defined by Equations (10–55) and (10–56) and the observer model is defined by Equation (10–57).  \n\nTo obtain the observer error equation, let us subtract Equation (10–57) from Equation (10–55):  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,-\\,\\overset{\\cdot}{\\mathbf{\\Delta}\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}(\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{C}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,)}\\\\ &{\\qquad\\qquad\\quad=\\,\\big(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\big)(\\mathbf{x}\\,-\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDefine the difference between $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ as the error vector e, or  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}=\\mathbf{x}-\\widetilde{\\mathbf{\\deltax}}\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (10–58) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}=(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{e}\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation (10–59), we see that the dynamic behavior of the error vector is determined by the eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Psi}-\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{\\Psi}\\mathbf{C}.$ . If matrix $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}$ is a stable matrix, the error vector will converge to zero for any initial error vector ${\\bf e}(0)$ .That is, $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\left(t\\right)$ will converge to ${\\bf x}(t)$ regardless of the values of ${\\bf x}(0)$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\left(0\\right)$ .If the eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}$ are chosen in such a way that the dynamic behavior of the error vector is asymptotically stable and is adequately fast, then any error vector will tend to zero (the origin) with an adequate speed.  \n\nIf the plant is completely observable, then it can be proved that it is possible to choose matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ such that $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}$ has arbitrarily desired eigenvalues. That is, the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ can be determined to yield the desired matrix ${\\bf A}\\mathrm{~-~}{\\bf K}_{e}\\,\\mathrm{~\\boldmath~\\Lambda~}$ C. We shall discuss this matter in what follows.  \n\nDual Problem. The problem of designing a full-order observer becomes that of determining the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ such that the error dynamics defined by Equation (10–59) are asymptotically stable with sufficient speed of response. (The asymptotic stability and the speed of response of the error dynamics are determined by the eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}.$ ) Hence, the design of the full-order observer becomes that of determining an appropriate $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ such that $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}$ has desired eigenvalues.Thus, the problem here becomes the same as the pole-placement problem we discussed in Section 10–2. In fact, the two problems are mathematically the same. This property is called duality.  \n\nConsider the system defined by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\mathrm{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn designing the full-order state observer, we may solve the dual problem, that is, solve the pole-placement problem for the dual system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{z}}=\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{z}+\\mathbf{C}^{*}v}\\\\ {\\quad n=\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{z}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nassuming the control signal $v$ to be  \n\n$$\nv\\,=\\,-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{z}\n$$  \n\nIf the dual system is completely state controllable, then the state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ can be determined such that matrix $\\mathbf{A}^{*}-\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{K}$ will yield a set of the desired eigenvalues.  \n\nIf $\\mu_{1}$ ,$\\mu_{2},\\ldots,\\mu_{n}$ are the desired eigenvalues of the state observer matrix, then by taking the same ${\\pmb{\\mu}}_{i}^{\\prime}$ ’s as the desired eigenvalues of the state-feedback gain matrix of the dual system, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,(\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{K})\\right|=(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})\\cdots(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{n})\n$$  \n\nNoting that the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}^{*}-\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{K}$ and those of $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{C}$ are the same, we have  \n\n$$\n\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\left(\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{K}\\right)\\right|\\,=\\,\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\right|\n$$  \n\nComparing the characteristic polynomial $\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\right.-\\left.\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\right|$ @@and the characteristic polynomial $\\bar{|\\boldsymbol{s}\\mathbf{I}|}-\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\,\\,$ for the observer system [refer to Equation (10–57)], we find that $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ and $\\mathbf{K}^{*}$ are related by  \n\n$$\n{\\bf K}_{e}={\\bf K}^{*}\n$$  \n\nThus,using the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ determined by the pole-placement approach in the dual system, the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ for the original system can be determined by using the relationship ${\\bf K}_{e}={\\bf K}^{*}$ . (See Problem A–10–10 for the details.)  \n\nNecessary and Sufficient Condition for State Observation. As discussed, a necessary and sufficient condition for the determination of the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ for the desired eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}$ is that the dual of the original system  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{z}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{z}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{C}^{*}v\n$$  \n\nbe completely state controllable. The complete state controllability condition for this dual system is that the rank of  \n\n$$\n\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\right]\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\vdots\\ \\cdots\\ \\vdots\\ \\left(\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\right)^{n-1}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]\n$$  \n\nbe $n$ .This is the condition for complete observability of the original system defined by Equations (10–55) and (10–56).This means that a necessary and sufficient condition for the observation of the state of the system defined by Equations (10–55) and (10–56) is that the system be completely observable.  \n\nOnce we select the desired eigenvalues (or desired characteristic equation), the fullorder state observer can be designed, provided the plant is completely observable.The desired eigenvalues of the characteristic equation should be chosen so that the state observer responds at least two to five times faster than the closed-loop system considered.As stated earlier, the equation for the full-order state observer is  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{\\textbf{x}}}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\ +\\mathbf{B}u\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}y\n$$  \n\nIt is noted that thus far we have assumed the matrices $\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}$ , and Cin the observer to be exactly the same as those of the physical plant. If there are discrepancies in A ,B,and Cin the observer and in the physical plant, the dynamics of the observer error are no longer governed by Equation (10–59). This means that the error may not approach zero as expected.Therefore, we need to choose $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ so that the observer is stable and the error remains acceptably small in the presence of small modeling errors.  \n\nTransformation Approach to Obtain State Observer Gain Matrix $\\upkappa_{e}$ .By following the same approach as we used in deriving the equation for the state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ , we can obtain the following equation:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\mathbf{Q}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\alpha_{n}\\,-\\,a_{n}}\\\\ {\\alpha_{n-1}\\,-\\,a_{n-1}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\alpha_{1}\\,-\\,a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\,\\left(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{N}^{*}\\right)^{-1}\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\alpha_{n}\\,-\\,a_{n}}\\\\ {\\alpha_{n-1}\\,-\\,a_{n-1}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\alpha_{1}\\,-\\,a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ is an $n\\times1$ matrix,  \n\n$$\n{\\bf Q}\\,=\\,({\\bf W}{\\bf N}^{*})^{-1}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}=\\left[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\ \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\right]\\ \\cdots\\ \\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\left[\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\right)^{n-1}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\right]\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{W}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l}{a_{n-1}}&{a_{n-2}}&{\\cdots}&{a_{1}}&{1}\\\\ {a_{n-2}}&{a_{n-3}}&{\\cdots}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {.}&{.}&{.}&{.}\\\\ {.}&{.}&{.}&{.}\\\\ {.}&{.}&{.}&{.}\\\\ {a_{1}}&{1}&{\\cdots}&{0}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{\\cdots}&{0}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\n[Refer to Problem A–10–10 for the derivation of Equation (10–61).]  \n\nDirect-Substitution Approach to Obtain State Observer Gain Matrix $\\upkappa_{e}$ .Similar to the case of pole placement,if the system is of low order,then direct substitution of matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ into the desired characteristic polynomial may be simpler. For example, if $\\mathbf{X}$ is a 3-vector, then write the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ as  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{k_{e1}}\\\\ {k_{e2}}\\\\ {k_{e3}}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nSubstitute this $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ matrix into the desired characteristic polynomial:  \n\n$$\n\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\right|\\,=\\,(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{3})\n$$  \n\nBy equating the coefficients of the like powers of $s$ on both sides of this last equation, we can determine the values of $k_{e1},k_{e2}$ ,and $k_{e3}$ .This approach is convenient if $n=1$ ,2, or 3, where $n$ is the dimension of the state vector $\\mathbf{X}$ . (Although this approach can be used when $n=4,5,6,\\dots$ , the computations involved may become very tedious.)  \n\nAnother approach to the determination of the state observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ is to use Ackermann’s formula.This approach is presented in the following.  \n\nAckermann’s Formula. Consider the system defined by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\mathrm{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nIn Section 10–2 we derived Ackermann’s formula for pole placement for the system defined by Equation (10–62).The result was given by Equation (10–18), rewritten thus:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=[0\\quad0\\,\\cdots\\,0\\quad1]\\big[\\mathbf{B}\\,\\,\\mid\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\\,\\,\\mid\\,\\cdots\\,\\mid\\,\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}\\mathbf{B}\\big]^{-1}\\phi(\\mathbf{A})\n$$  \n\nFor the dual of the system defined by Equations (10–62) and (10–63),  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{z}}=\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{z}+\\mathbf{C}^{*}v}\\\\ {\\quad n=\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{z}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nthe preceding Ackermann’s formula for pole placement is modified to  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=[0\\quad0\\,\\cdots\\,0\\quad1]\\big[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\,\\mid\\,\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\,\\mid\\,\\cdots\\,\\mid\\,(\\mathbf{A}^{*})^{n-1}\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\big]^{-1}\\phi(\\mathbf{A}^{*})\n$$  \n\nAs stated earlier, the state observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ is given by $\\mathbf{K}^{*}$ , where $\\mathbf{K}$ is given by Equation (10–64).Thus,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\mathbf{K}^{*}=\\phi(\\mathbf{A}^{*})^{*}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{C}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-2}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}}\\end{array}\\right]}^{-1}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}=\\phi(\\mathbf{A}){\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathbf{C}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-2}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{n-1}}\\end{array}\\right]}^{-1}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {\\cdot}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\phi(s)$ is the desired characteristic polynomial for the state observer, or  \n\n$$\n\\phi(s)\\,=\\,{\\big(}s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1}{\\big)}{\\big(}s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2}{\\big)}\\cdots{\\big(}s\\,-\\,\\mu_{n}{\\big)}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},\\ldots,\\mu_{n}$ are the desired eigenvalues. Equation (10–65) is called Ackermann’s formula for the determination of the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ .  \n\nComments on Selecting the Best $\\upkappa_{e}$ .Referring to Figure 10–11, notice that the feedback signal through the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ serves as a correction signal to the plant model to account for the unknowns in the plant. If significant unknowns are involved, the feedback signal through the matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ should be relatively large. However, if the output signal is contaminated significantly by disturbances and measurement noises, then the output $y$ is not reliable and the feedback signal through the matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ should be relatively small. In determining the matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ ,we should carefully examine the effects of disturbances and noises involved in the output $y$ .  \n\nRemember that the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ depends on the desired characteristic equation  \n\n$$\n(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})\\cdots(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{n})\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nThe choice of a set of $\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2},\\ldots,\\mu_{n}$ is, in many instances, not unique.As a general rule, however, the observer poles must be two to five times faster than the controller poles to make sure the observation error (estimation error) converges to zero quickly. This means that the observer estimation error decays two to five times faster than does the state vector $\\mathbf{X}$ . Such faster decay of the observer error compared with the desired dynamics makes the controller poles dominate the system response.  \n\nIt is important to note that if sensor noise is considerable,we may choose the observer poles to be slower than two times the controller poles, so that the bandwidth of the system will become lower and smooth the noise. In this case the system response will be strongly influenced by the observer poles. If the observer poles are located to the right of the controller poles in the left-half $s$ plane, the system response will be dominated by the observer poles rather than by the control poles.  \n\nIn the design of the state observer, it is desirable to determine several observer gain matrices $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ based on several different desired characteristic equations. For each of the several different matrices $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ ,simulation tests must be run to evaluate the resulting system performance. Then we select the best $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ from the viewpoint of overall system performance. In many practical cases, the selection of the best matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ boils down to a compromise between speedy response and sensitivity to disturbances and noises.  \n\nEXAMPLE 10–6 Consider the system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l r l}&{\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{20.6}\\\\ {1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right],}&&{\\mathbf{B}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right],}&&{\\mathbf{C}=[0}&{1]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe use the observed state feedback such that  \n\n$$\nu=-\\mathbf{K}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$  \n\nDesign a full-order state observer, assuming that the system configuration is identical to that shown in Figure 10–11.Assume that the desired eigenvalues of the observer matrix are  \n\n$$\n\\mu_{1}=-10,\\qquad\\mu_{2}=-10\n$$  \n\nThe design of the state observer reduces to the determination of an appropriate observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ .  \n\nLet us examine the observability matrix.The rank of  \n\n$$\n[\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\ \\vdots\\ \\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{C}^{*}]={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nis 2.Hence,the system is completely observable and the determination of the desired observer gain matrix is possible.We shall solve this problem by three methods.  \n\nMethod 1: We shall determine the observer gain matrix by use of Equation (10–61). The given system is already in the observable canonical form. Hence, the transformation matrix $\\mathbf{Q}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{N}^{*})^{-1}$ is I . Since the characteristic equation of the given system is  \n\n$$\n|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}|={\\left|\\begin{array}{l l}{s}&{-20.6}\\\\ {-1}&{\\;\\;\\;s}\\end{array}\\right|}=s^{2}-20.6=s^{2}+a_{1}s\\,+\\,a_{2}=0\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\na_{1}=0,\\qquad a_{2}=-20.6\n$$  \n\nThe desired characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\n(s\\,+\\,10)^{2}=s^{2}\\,+\\,20s\\,+\\,100\\,=\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,\\alpha_{1}s\\,+\\,\\alpha_{2}=0\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\alpha_{1}=20,\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\alpha_{2}=100\n$$  \n\nThen the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ can be obtained from Equation (10–61) as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{N}^{*})^{-1}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{\\alpha_{2}-\\,a_{2}}\\\\ {\\alpha_{1}-\\,a_{1}}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{1}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{100+20.6}\\\\ {20-\\,\\,\\,0}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{120.6}\\\\ {20}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nMethod 2: Referring to Equation (10–59):  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}=(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{e}\n$$  \n\nthe characteristic equation for the observer becomes  \n\n$$\n\\left|s\\mathbf{I}\\right.-\\left.\\mathbf{A}\\right.+\\left.\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\right|=0\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{k_{e1}}\\\\ {k_{e2}}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nThen the characteristic equation becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\left|\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{s}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{s}\\end{array}\\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{20.6}\\\\ {1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]+\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{k_{e1}}\\\\ {k_{e2}}\\end{array}\\right][0}&{1]\\right|=\\left|\\begin{array}{l l}{s}&{-20.6\\,+\\,k_{e1}}\\\\ {-1}&{\\;\\;\\,s\\,+\\,k_{e2}}\\end{array}\\right|}\\\\ &{=s^{2}+\\,k_{e2}s-20.6\\,+\\,k_{e1}=0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSince the desired characteristic equation is  \n\n$$\ns^{2}\\,+\\,20s\\,+\\,100\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nby comparing Equation (10–66) with this last equation, we obtain  \n\n$$\nk_{e1}=120.6,\\qquad k_{e2}=20\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{120.6}\\\\ {20}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nMethod 3: We shall use Ackermann’s formula given by Equation (10–65):  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\phi(\\mathbf{A})\\left[\\mathbf{C}_{\\mathbf{A}}^{\\mathrm{~C~}}\\right]^{-1}\\!\\!\\left[\\mathbf{\\Omega}_{1}\\right]\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\phi(s)\\,=\\,(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{1})(s\\,-\\,\\mu_{2})\\,=\\,s^{2}\\,+\\,20s\\,+\\,100\n$$  \n\nThus,  \n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{A})\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}^{2}\\,+\\,20\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,100\\mathbf{I}\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}^{2}+20\\mathbf{A}+100\\mathbf{I}\\right){\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}^{-1}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\\\ &{\\qquad={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{120.6}&{412}\\\\ {20}&{120.6}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\\\ {1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{120.6}\\\\ {20}\\end{array}\\right]}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nAs a matter of course, we get the same $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ regardless of the method employed. The equation for the full-order state observer is given by Equation (10–57),  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{\\textbf{x}}}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\ +\\mathbf{B}u\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}y\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n{\\binom{\\dot{\\pi}_{1}}{\\dot{\\pi}_{2}}}={\\binom{0}{1}}\\ \\ 100{\\Biggl]}{\\Biggl[}{\\Biggl[}{\\tilde{x}_{1}}{\\atop{\\tilde{x}_{2}}}{\\Biggr]}+{\\Biggl[}{0{\\atop1}}{\\Biggr]}u+{\\Biggl[}{120.6}{\\Biggr]}y\n$$  \n\nFinally, it is noted that, similar to the case of pole placement, if the system order $n$ is 4 or higher, methods 1 and 3 are preferred, because all matrix computations can be carried out by a computer, while method 2 always requires hand computation of the characteristic equation involving unknown parameters $k_{e1}$ ,$k_{e2},\\ldots,k_{e n}$ .  \n\nEffects of the Addition of the Observer on a Closed-Loop System. In the pole-placement design process, we assumed that the actual state ${\\bf x}(t)$ was available for feedback. In practice, however, the actual state ${\\bf x}(t)$ may not be measurable, so we will need to design an observer and use the observed state $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\left(t\\right)$ for feedback as shown in Figure 10–12. The design process, therefore, becomes a two-stage process, the first stage being the determination of the feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ to yield the desired characteristic equation and the second stage being the determination of the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ to yield the desired observer characteristic equation.  \n\nLet us now investigate the effects of the use of the observed state $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\left(t\\right)$ ,rather than the actual state ${\\bf x}(t)$ ,on the characteristic equation of a closed-loop control system.  \n\nThe image presents a complex flowchart with various symbols and arrows, which can be broken down into several key components.\n\n*   **Input Variables**\n    *   The chart begins with two input variables: u and y.\n        *   u is represented by an arrow pointing to the left.\n        *   y is represented by an arrow pointing to the right.\n*   **Mathematical Operations**\n    *   Various mathematical operations are performed on these input variables, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^).\n        *   These operations are denoted by symbols such as +, -, *, /, and ^.\n        *   For example, the operation x = y - 2 is represented by an arrow pointing to the right with a minus sign below it.\n*   **Functions**\n    *   The chart also includes various functions, including sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), natural logarithm (ln), and exponential (exp).\n        *   These functions are denoted by symbols such as sin, cos, tan, ln, and exp.\n        *   For example, the function y = sin(x) is represented by an arrow pointing to the right with a sine wave symbol above it.\n*   **Constants**\n    *   The chart includes several constants, including pi (π), e, and 1.\n        *   These constants are denoted by symbols such as π, e, and 1.\n        *   For example, the constant π is represented by an arrow pointing to the right with a symbol above it.\n*   **Variables**\n    *   The chart also includes several variables, including x, y, z, and w.\n        *   These variables are denoted by symbols such as x, y, z, and w.\n        *   For example, the variable x is represented by an arrow pointing to the right with a symbol above it.\n\nIn summary, the flowchart represents a complex mathematical expression involving input variables, mathematical operations, functions, constants, and variables. The chart uses a combination of symbols and arrows to represent these elements and their relationships. 10–12 Observed-state feedback control system.  \n\nConsider the completely state controllable and completely observable system defined by the equations  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\mathrm{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFor the state-feedback control based on the observed state $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ ,  \n\n$$\nu=-\\mathbf{K}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$  \n\nWith this control, the state equation becomes  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{x}\\,-\\,{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}}\\,)\n$$  \n\nThe difference between the actual state ${\\bf x}(t)$ and the observed state $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\left(t\\right)$ has been defined as the error $\\mathbf{e}(t)$ :  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}(t)\\,=\\,\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,-\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,(t)\n$$  \n\nSubstitution of the error vector $\\mathbf{e}(t)$ into Equation (10–67) gives  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{Ke}\n$$  \n\nNote that the observer error equation was given by Equation (10–59), repeated here:  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}=(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{e}\n$$  \n\nCombining Equations (10–68) and (10–69), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}\\\\ {\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c}{\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}}&{\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\mathbf{0}}&{\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\mathbf{x}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{e}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nChapter 10 /Control Systems Design in State Space  \n\nEquation (10–70) describes the dynamics of the observed-state feedback control system.

This means that the pole-placement design and the observer design are independent of each other.They can be designed separately and combined to form the observed-state feedback control system. Note that, if the order of the plant is $n$ ,then the observer is also of nth order (if the full-order state observer is used), and the resulting characteristic equation for the entire closed-loop system becomes of order $2n$ .  \n\nTransfer Function of the Observer-Based Controller. Consider the plant defined by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nAssume that the plant is completely observable. Assume that we use observed-state feedback control $u=-\\mathbf{K}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ .Then, the equations for the observer are given by  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\tilde{\\textbf{x}}}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\right)\\widetilde{\\textbf{x}}+\\mathbf{K}_{e}y}\\\\ {u=-\\mathbf{K}\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere Equation (10–71) is obtained by substituting $u=-\\mathbf{K}\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}$ into Equation (10–57).  \n\nBy taking the Laplace transform of Equation (10–71), assuming a zero initial condition, and solving for $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{X}}(s)$ we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{X}}(s)\\,=\\,\\bigl(s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\bigr)^{-1}\\mathbf{K}_{e}Y(s)\n$$  \n\nBy substituting this $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{X}}(s)$ into the Laplace transform of Equation (10–72), we obtain  \n\n$$\nU(s)=-\\mathbf{K}(s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})^{-1}\\mathbf{K}_{e}Y(s)\n$$  \n\nThen the transfer function $U(s)/Y(s)$ can be obtained as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{U(s)}{Y(s)}=-\\mathbf{K}\\big(s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\big)^{-1}\\mathbf{K}_{e}\n$$  \n\nFigure 10–13 shows the block diagram representation for the system.

The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top section represents the input signal R(s) and its transformation through various blocks, while the bottom section illustrates the plant's response to this transformed signal.\n\n*   **Top Section:**\n    *   **R(s)**: The input signal is represented by the variable R(s), which is fed into a block labeled \"Transfer Function.\"\n        *   **Transfer Function**: This block transforms the input signal R(s) using a transfer function, as indicated by the label. However, the specific transfer function used in this application is not specified.\n        *   **-Y(s)**: The output of the transfer function block is denoted as -Y(s), suggesting that it represents an inverted version of the transformed input signal Y(s).\n    *   **U(s)**: The output of the transfer function block, U(s), is fed into a block labeled \"Plant.\"\n        *   **Plant**: This block represents the system or process being controlled by the control loop.

The purpose of this program is to solve a mathematical problem.\n\n* A MATLAB program\n\t+ The program starts with a list of variables and their initial values: `A = [0 1; 20.6 0]; B = [0; 1]; C = [1 0]; K = [29.6 3.6]; Ke = [16; 84.6];`\n\t+ The program then defines a function `sys` that takes no arguments and returns an array of values.\n\t+ The function `ss` is used to create a state-space representation of the system, with the input and output matrices defined as `[A-B*K B*Ke]` and `[C; D]`, respectively.\n\t+ The program then uses the `syslin` command to define the linearized system model.\n\t+ The program includes several comments throughout, explaining the purpose of each section of code.\n\nOverall, this program appears to be solving a mathematical problem related to control systems or signal processing. The specific details of the problem are not clear without additional context or information about the expected output.  \n\nThe image presents a comprehensive analysis of the response to an initial condition, comprising four distinct graphs that illustrate various aspects of this phenomenon. The graphs are arranged in two rows, with each row containing two graphs.\n\n**Top Row:**\n\n*   **State Variable x1**: This graph displays the state variable x1 over time, ranging from 0 to 4 seconds. The curve exhibits a smooth, continuous trajectory, indicating a stable response to the initial condition.\n*   **State Variable x2**: Similar to the previous graph, this plot shows the state variable x2 over time, also spanning from 0 to 4 seconds. The curve follows a smooth path, suggesting that the system is responding predictably to the initial condition.\n\n**Bottom Row:**\n\n*   **Error State Variable e1**: This graph focuses on the error state variable e1, which represents the difference between the actual and desired states of the system. The plot spans from 0 to 4 seconds and exhibits a smooth curve, indicating that the system is able to correct its trajectory over time.\n*   **Error State Variable e2**: The final graph displays the error state variable e2, again showing a smooth curve over time. This suggests that the system is capable of adjusting its behavior in response to errors or discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   The x-axis for all graphs represents time, ranging from 0 to 4 seconds.\n*   The y-axis varies depending on the specific graph, but generally represents either a state variable (x1 and x2) or an error state variable (e1 and e2).\n*   The title of each graph indicates its corresponding state or error state variable.\n\nOverall, the image provides a detailed examination of how a system responds to an initial condition, highlighting the stability and predictability of its behavior over time. 10–15 Response curves to initial condition.  \n\nMinimum-Order Observer. The observers discussed thus far are designed to reconstruct all the state variables. In practice, some of the state variables may be accurately measured. Such accurately measurable state variables need not be estimated.  \n\nSuppose that the state vector $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n$ -vector and the output vector $\\mathbf{y}$ is an $_m$ -vector that can be measured. Since $_m$ output variables are linear combinations of the state variables, mstate variables need not be estimated. We need to estimate only $n\\,-\\,m$ state variables.Then the reduced-order observer becomes an $(n\\mathrm{~-~}m)$ th-order observer. Such an $(n\\mathrm{~-~}m)$ th-order observer is the minimum-order observer. Figure 10–16 shows the block diagram of a system with a minimum-order observer.  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of minimum-order observer design. The chart is divided into several sections, each representing a different stage in the design process.\n\n*   **Plant**\n    *   The plant represents the system being observed.\n    *   It is represented by a box labeled \"Plant\" and has two inputs: u and x.\n    *   The output of the plant is y.\n*   **Minimum-Order Observer**\n    *   The minimum-order observer is designed to estimate the state of the plant based on its input and output.\n    *   It is represented by a box labeled \"Minimum-Order Observer\" and has two inputs: u and x.\n    *   The output of the observer is ŷ, which is an estimate of the actual output y.\n*   **Transformation**\n    *   The transformation block converts the estimated state from the minimum-order observer into a form that can be used for control purposes.\n    *   It is represented by a box labeled \"Transformation\" and has one input: x̂.\n    *   The output of the transformation block is v, which is used as the input to the controller.\n*   **Controller**\n    *   The controller generates the control signal based on the transformed estimate of the state.\n    *   It is represented by a box labeled \"Controller\" and has one input: v.\n    *   The output of the controller is u, which is fed back into the plant as an input.\n\nOverall, the flowchart shows how the minimum-order observer design process works. It takes the actual output y and uses it to estimate the state of the plant. This estimated state is then transformed and used as the input to the controller, which generates the control signal u. The control signal is then fed back into the plant as an input, completing the loop. 10–16 Observed-state feedback control system with a minimum-order observer.  \n\nIt is important to note, however, that if the measurement of output variables involves significant noises and is relatively inaccurate, then the use of the full-order observer may result in a better system performance.  \n\nTo present the basic idea of the minimum-order observer, without undue mathematical complications, we shall present the case where the output is a scalar (that is, $m\\,=\\,1$ ) and derive the state equation for the minimum-order observer. Consider the system  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\qquad\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nhe state vector D$\\mathbf{X}$ can be partitio d into two parts $x_{a}$ (a alar) and $\\mathbf{x}_{b}$ Can $(n\\mathrm{~-~}1)$ -vector . Here the state variable $x_{a}$ is equal to the output $y$ and thus can be directly measured, and $\\mathbf{x}_{b}$ is the unmeasurable portion of the state vector. Then the partitioned state and output equations become  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{{\\small\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{{\\dot{x}}_{a}}\\\\ {{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}_{b}}\\end{array}\\!\\right]}={\\small\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{A_{a a}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{A}_{b a}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}{\\mathbf{A}}_{b b}{\\small\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{{\\mathbf{x}}_{a}}\\\\ {{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}+{\\small\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{B_{a}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{B}_{b}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}u}\\\\ {y={\\small\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c c}{1}&{!}\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{b}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}{\\small\\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c}{x_{a}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}_{b}}\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right]}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{a a}=$ scalar  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{A}_{a b}=1\\times\\left(n\\,-\\,1\\right)\\mathrm{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{A}_{b a}=\\left(n\\,-\\,1\\right)\\times1\\,\\mathrm{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{A}_{b b}=\\left(n\\,-\\,1\\right)\\times\\left(n\\,-\\,1\\right)\\mathrm{matrix}}\\\\ &{\\;\\;B_{a}=\\mathrm{scalar}}\\\\ &{\\mathbf{B}_{b}=\\left(n\\,-\\,1\\right)\\times1\\,\\mathrm{matrix}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nFrom Equation (10–81), the equation for the measured portion of the state becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{x}_{a}=A_{a a}x_{a}+\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\mathbf{x}_{b}\\,+\\,B_{a}u\n$$  \n\nor  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{x}}_{a}\\,-\\,A_{a a}x_{a}\\,-\\,B_{a}u\\,=\\,{\\bf A}_{a b}\\,{\\bf x}_{b}\n$$  \n\nThe terms on the left-hand side of Equation (10–83) can be measured. Equation (10–83) acts as the output equation. In designing the minimum-order observer, we consider the left-hand side of Equation (10–83) to be known quantities.Thus,Equation (10–83) relates the measurable quantities and unmeasurable quantities of the state.  \n\nFrom Equation (10–81), the equation for the unmeasured portion of the state becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}=\\mathbf{A}_{b a}x_{a}+\\mathbf{A}_{b b}\\mathbf{x}_{b}+\\mathbf{B}_{b}u\n$$  \n\nNoting that terms ${\\bf A}_{b a}x_{a}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{b}u$ are known quantities, Equation (10–84) describes the dynamics of the unmeasured portion of the state.  \n\nIn what follows we shall present a method for designing a minimum-order observer. The design procedure can be simplified if we utilize the design technique developed for the full-order state observer.  \n\nLet us compare the state equation for the full-order observer with that for the minimum-order observer.The state equation for the full-order observer is  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u\n$$  \n\nand the “state equation” for the minimum-order observer is  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}=\\mathbf{A}_{b b}\\mathbf{x}_{b}+\\mathbf{A}_{b a}x_{a}+\\mathbf{B}_{b}u\n$$  \n\nThe output equation for the full-order observer is  \n\n$$\ny=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nand the “output equation” for the minimum-order observer is  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{x}}_{a}\\,-\\,A_{a a}x_{a}\\,-\\,B_{a}u\\,=\\,{\\bf A}_{a b}\\,{\\bf x}_{b}\n$$  \n\nThe design of the minimum-order observer can be carried out as follows: First, note that the observer equation for the full-order observer was given by Equation (10–57), which we repeat here:  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\tilde{\\textbf{x}}}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{C}\\right)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\ +\\mathbf{B}u\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}y\n$$  \n\nThen, making the substitutions of Table 10–1 into Equation (10–85), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\dot{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}}_{\\,b}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}\\mathbf{\\Phi}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\right)\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{\\,b}+\\mathbf{A}_{b a}x_{a}+\\mathbf{B}_{b}u\\,+\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\big(\\dot{x}_{a}-\\mathbf{\\Phi}A_{a a}x_{a}-\\,B_{a}u\\big)}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere the state observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ is an $(n\\mathrm{~-~}1)\\times1$ matrix. In Equation (10–86), notice that in order to estimate $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{\\,b}$ ,we need the derivative of $x_{a}$ .This presents a difficulty, because differentiation amplifies noise. If $x_{a}\\left(=y\\right)$ is noisy, the use of $\\dot{x}_{a}$ is unacceptable.  \n\nTable 10–1 List of Necessary Substitutions for Writing the Observer Equation for the Minimum-Order State Observer   \n\nThe image presents a table with two columns, labeled \"Full-Order State Observer\" and \"Minimum,\" separated by a vertical line. The first column lists various terms related to state observers, while the second column contains the corresponding minimum values.\n\n*   **First Column:**\n    *   The first term is **x**, which represents the state of the system.\n    *   The second term is **A**, likely representing a matrix or coefficient in the observer design.\n    *   The third term is **Bu**, indicating a relationship between input **u** and the system's behavior.\n    *   The fourth term is **y**, denoting the output of the system.\n    *   The fifth term is **C**, possibly referring to a coefficient or matrix related to measurement or feedback.\n    *   The sixth term is **K_e (n x 1 matrix)**, representing a gain vector for the observer update law.\n*   **Second Column:**\n    *   Each of these terms is associated with its minimum value in the second column.\n\nIn summary, the table provides a concise overview of key components involved in designing full-order state observers, along with their respective minimum values. These components include the system's state (**x**), input (**u**), output (**y**), and coefficients or matrices (**A**, **B**, **C**) necessary for observer design, as well as the gain vector (**K_e**) used to update the observer estimate.  \n\nTo avoid this difficulty, we eliminate $\\dot{x}_{a}$ in the following way. First rewrite Equation (10–86) as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\dot{x}_{a}=\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\right)\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}+\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{b a}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}A_{a a}\\right)y+\\left(\\mathbf{B}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}B_{a}\\right)\\boldsymbol{u}}\\\\ {=\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\right)\\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}y)\\quad}\\\\ {+\\left[\\left(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\right)\\mathbf{K}_{e}+\\mathbf{A}_{b a}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}A_{a a}\\right]y\\quad}\\\\ {+\\left(\\mathbf{B}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}B_{a}\\right)\\!\\right)\\quad}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\mathbf{x}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}y=\\mathbf{x}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}x_{a}=\\pmb{\\eta}}\\\\ &{}\\\\ &{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{\\,b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}y=\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}_{\\,b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}x_{a}=\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\eta}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (10–87) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{\\dot{\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\eta}}}=\\big(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\big)\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\eta}}\\,+\\big[\\big(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\big)\\mathbf{K}_{e}}\\\\ &{\\qquad+\\mathbf{A}_{b a}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\boldsymbol{A}_{a a}\\big]y\\,+\\big(\\mathbf{B}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\boldsymbol{B}_{a}\\big)\\boldsymbol{u}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\mathbf{A}_{b b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}}\\\\ {\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\mathbf{K}_{e}+\\mathbf{A}_{b a}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}A_{a a}}\\\\ {\\hat{\\mathbf{F}}=\\mathbf{B}_{b}-\\mathbf{K}_{e}B_{a}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (10–89) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\pmb{\\dot{\\eta}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\pmb{\\widetilde{\\eta}}+\\hat{\\mathbf{B}}y\\,+\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{F}}u\n$$  \n\nEquation (10–90) and Equation (10–88) together define the minimum-order observer.

The minimum-order observer at the center plays a crucial role in managing these interactions within the system. 10–17 System with observed-state feedback, where the observer is the minimum-order observer.   \nTransformation  \n\nBy subtracting Equation (10–92) from Equation (10–84), we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}\\,-\\,\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\mathbf{x}}_{b}=\\bigl({\\mathbf{A}}_{b b}\\,-\\,{\\mathbf{K}}_{e}\\,{\\mathbf{A}}_{a b}\\bigr)(\\mathbf{x}_{b}\\,-\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,_{b})\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{x}_{b}\\,-\\,\\widetilde{\\mathbf{x}}\\,_{b}\\,=\\,\\pmb{\\eta}\\,-\\,\\widetilde{\\pmb{\\eta}}\n$$  \n\nThen Equation (10–93) becomes  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}\\,=\\,\\bigl(\\mathbf{A}_{b b}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\,\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\bigr)\\mathbf{e}\n$$  \n\nThis is the error equation for the minimum-order observer.

For the case of the observed-state feedback control system with full-order state observer, we have shown that the closed-loop poles of the observed-state feedback control system consist of the poles due to the pole-placement design alone, plus the poles due to the observer design alone. Hence, the pole-placement design and the full-order observer design are independent of each other.  \n\nFor the observed-state feedback control system with minimum-order observer, the same conclusion applies.The system characteristic equation can be derived as  \n\n$$\n\\bigl|s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{BK}\\bigl||s\\mathbf{I}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{A}_{b b}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\,\\mathbf{A}_{a b}\\bigr|\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\n(See Problem back control system with a minimum-order observer comprise the closed-loop poles due to pole placement A–10–11 for the details.)

Because of the duality of pole-placement and observer design, the same algorithm can be applied to both the pole-placement problem and the observer-design problem. Thus, the commands acker and place can be used to determine the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ .  \n\nThe closed-loop poles of the observer are the eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{\\delta}\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\,\\mathbf{\\(}$ C.The closed-loop poles of the pole-placement are the eigenvalues of matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ .  \n\nReferring to the duality problem between the pole-placement problem and observerdesign problem,we can determine $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ by considering the pole-placement problem for the dual system. That is, we determine $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ by placing the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{C}^{*}\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ at the desired place. Since ${\\bf K}_{e}={\\bf K}^{*}$ , for the full-order observer we use the command  \n\n$$\n\\mathsf{K}_{\\mathrm{e}}=\\mathsf{a c k e r}(\\mathsf{A}^{\\prime},\\mathsf{C}^{\\prime},\\mathsf{L})^{\\prime}\n$$  \n\nwhere Lis the vector of the desired eigenvalues for the observer.

The block diagram helps to illustrate how the various components of the system interact with each other, and the table provides a concise summary of the resulting transfer function.  \n\n# Figure 10–20 Block diagram of System 1.  \n\nThe image presents a control system diagram, comprising various components and symbols. The key elements of the diagram are:\n\n* **Input Signal**: A signal labeled \"r = 0\" is fed into the system from the left side.\n\t+ This input signal represents the reference or desired output value for the control system.\n* **Controller**: A box containing mathematical equations, denoted as \"9.1s^2 + 73.5s + 125 / s^2 + 17s - 30\", serves as the controller.\n\t+ The controller processes the input signal and generates an appropriate output to regulate the system's behavior.\n* **Plant**: A box labeled \"10(s + 2) / (s + 4)(s + 6)\" represents the plant or process being controlled.\n\t+ This block models the dynamics of the physical system being regulated, such as a mechanical or electrical system.\n* **Observer Controller**: Another box containing an equation, denoted as \"9.1s^2 + 73.5s + 125 / s^2 + 17s - 30\", is connected to the plant.\n\t+ This observer controller is used to estimate the state of the plant and provide feedback to the main controller.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a control system consisting of an input signal, a controller, a plant, and an observer controller. The controller processes the input signal and generates an output to regulate the plant's behavior, while the observer controller estimates the plant's state and provides additional feedback to the main controller.  \n\nThe observer controller has a pole in the right-half $s$ plane ($(s=1.6119)$ ). The existence of an open-loop right-half $s$ plane pole in the observer controller means that the system is open-loop unstable, although the closed-loop system is stable. The latter can be seen from the characteristic equation for the system:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}|\\cdot|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}_{b b}+\\mathbf{K}_{e}\\mathbf{A}_{a b}|}\\\\ &{=s^{5}+27s^{4}+255s^{3}+1025s^{2}+2000s+2500}\\\\ &{=(s+1+j2)(s+1-j2)(s+5)(s+10)(s+10)=0}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n(See MATLAB Program 10–13 for the calculation of the characteristic equation.)  \n\nA disadvantage of using an unstable controller is that the system becomes unstable if the dc gain of the system becomes small. Such a control system is neither desirable nor acceptable. Hence, to get a satisfactory system, we need to modify the closed-loop pole location and/or observer pole location.  \n\nThe image shows a MATLAB program for solving a system of linear equations. The program is written in a monospaced font and consists of several lines of code that define variables, perform calculations, and display results.\n\n*   **Title**\n    *   \"MATLAB Program 10-13\"\n*   **Code**\n    *   `# Obetaining the characteristic equation`\n    *   `[num1,den1] = ss2tf(A-B*K,eye(3),eye(3))`\n    *   `[num2,den2] = ss2tf(Abb-Ke*Aab,eye(2),eye(2))`\n    *   `charact_eq = conv(den1,den2)`\n*   **Output**\n    *   The output of the program is not visible in this image.\n\nThe program uses the `ss2tf` function to convert state-space models to transfer functions, and then uses the `conv` function to compute the product of two polynomials. The result is stored in a variable called `charact_eq`.  \n\nSecond trial: Let us keep the desired closed-loop poles for pole placement as before, but modify the observer pole locations as follows:  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-4.5,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-4.5\n$$  \n\nThus,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L}=[-4.5\\mathrm{~\\ensuremath~{~\\alpha~\\mathrm{~-4.5~}}~}\\mathrm{~\\ensuremath~{~\\alpha~\\mathrm{~-4.5~}}~}]\n$$  \n\nUsing MATLAB, we find the new $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ to be  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{-1}\\\\ {6.25}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\nNext, we shall obtain the transfer function of the observer controller.

The response curves are shown in Figure 10–21.They seem to be acceptable.  \n\nThe image presents a MATLAB program with a title that reads \"MATLAB Program 10-15.\" The purpose of this program is to display a series of plots illustrating the response of a system to an initial condition.\n\n* A MATLAB program\n\t+ The program is written in a clear and organized manner, making it easy to follow.\n\t+ It includes comments at the top explaining what each section of the code does.\n\t+ The code uses various functions such as `A = [0 1 0; 0 -24 -10];` to define matrices and `plot(t,x)` to plot curves.\n* A title\n\t+ The title \"MATLAB Program 10-15\" is centered at the top of the image in a large font size.\n\t+ It provides context for what the program does and its purpose.\n* A series of plots\n\t+ There are multiple plots displayed below the code, each representing a different aspect of the system's response to an initial condition.\n\t+ The plots show how the variables change over time, providing valuable insights into the behavior of the system.\n\nOverall, the image effectively conveys information about a MATLAB program and its purpose through clear coding and well-labeled plots.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of six graphs, each displaying a distinct function.

There are no significant changes or comparisons to note within the scope of this image description. 10–21 Response to the given initial condition; $x_{1}(0)\\,=\\,1$ ,$x_{2}(0)\\,=\\,0$ ,$x_{3}(0)\\,=\\,0$ ,$e_{1}(0)\\,=\\,1$ ,$e_{2}(0)\\,=\\,0$ .  \n\nThe image presents a Bode diagram, which is a graphical representation of the frequency response of a system. The diagram consists of two subplots: one for the magnitude plot and another for the phase plot.\n\n**Magnitude Plot**\n\n*   **Title**: \"Bode Diagram of System 2 - Open Loop\"\n*   **Y-axis Label**: \"Magnitude (dB)\"\n*   **X-axis Label**: \"Frequency (rad/sec)\"\n*   **Plot Type**: Semi-logarithmic scale\n*   **Data Points**: A single curve representing the magnitude response of the system\n\n**Phase Plot**\n\n*   **Title**: Not provided\n*   **Y-axis Label**: \"Phase (deg)\"\n*   **X-axis Label**: \"Frequency (rad/sec)\"\n*   **Plot Type**: Semi-logarithmic scale\n*   **Data Points**: A single curve representing the phase response of the system\n\n**Key Features**\n\n*   The magnitude plot shows a decreasing trend as frequency increases, indicating that the system's gain decreases with increasing frequency.\n*   The phase plot exhibits a constant phase angle at low frequencies, followed by a gradual decrease in phase angle as frequency increases.\n*   The plots do not display any specific data points or markers, suggesting that they are intended to represent general trends rather than precise values.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Bode diagram provides a visual representation of the frequency response of System 2, highlighting its magnitude and phase characteristics. The diagrams suggest that the system has a decreasing gain with increasing frequency, accompanied by a gradual decrease in phase angle. However, without additional information or context, it is challenging to draw more specific conclusions about the system's behavior. 10–22 Bode diagram for the open-loop transfer function of System 2.  \n\nNext,we shall check the frequency-response characteristics.The Bode diagram of the open-loop system just designed is shown in Figure 10–22.The phase margin is about $40^{\\circ}$ and the gain margin is $+\\infty$ dB.The Bode diagram of the closed-loop system is shown in Figure 10–23.The bandwidth of the system is approximately 3.8 rad/sec.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a line plot. The top section displays a line plot of magnitude (dB) against frequency (rad/sec), while the bottom section shows a line plot of phase (deg) against frequency (rad/sec). Both plots share a common x-axis labeled \"Frequency (rad/sec)\" and an y-axis with tick marks for both negative and positive values. The top graph features tick marks at -60, -40, -20, 0, 20, 40, and 60 on the y-axis, while the bottom graph has tick marks at -200, -150, -100, -50, 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200.\n\nThe line plots in both sections exhibit a similar trend. The magnitude of the signal decreases as frequency increases, with a more pronounced decline in the lower frequency range. Conversely, the phase of the signal also changes over time, but at a slower rate compared to the magnitude. Notably, the graphs lack additional details such as labels or legends beyond the y-axis tick marks.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be a plot of frequency response characteristics for some unknown system or component, with the top graph showing how the magnitude of the signal varies over different frequencies and the bottom graph illustrating the corresponding phase shift. However, without further context or information, it is difficult to provide a more specific interpretation or analysis of these plots. 10–23 Bode diagram for the closed-loop transfer function of System 2.  \n\nFinally,we shall compare the root-locus plots of the first system with $L=[-10\\textrm{~-}10]$ and the second system with $L=[-4.5\\mathrm{~~~}-4.5]$ The plot for the first system given in Figure 10–24(a) shows that the system is unstable for small dc gain and becomes stable for large dc gain.The plot for the second system given in Figure 10–24(b), on the other hand, shows that the system is stable for any positive dc gain.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes: the x-axis (real axis) and the y-axis (imaginary axis). The graph is set against a white background, featuring grey lines that intersect to form squares. The x-axis is labeled \"Real Axis\" at its bottom edge, while the y-axis is labeled \"Imag Axis\" along its left side.\n\nA single curve dominates the image, situated in the upper-left quadrant. It begins near the origin (0, 0), traverses towards the right and upwards, before curving back to the left as it approaches the top of the graph. The curve's shape is characterized by a gradual ascent followed by a sharp descent.\n\nThe image also features several labels:\n\n*   **a**: This label likely refers to a mathematical equation or formula that has been omitted from the graph.\n*   **Imag Axis** and **Real Axis**: These labels indicate the orientation of the x-axis (real axis) at the bottom edge and the y-axis (imaginary axis) along the left side.\n\nOverall, the image appears to be a graphical representation of a mathematical function or equation, possibly related to complex numbers or algebraic expressions. However, without additional context or information, it is difficult to provide further details about the specific nature of the graph or its intended application.  \nRoot-Locus Plot of $(91s^{3}+917s^{2}+2720s+2500)/$ $(s^{5}+27s^{4}+164s^{3}+108s^{2}-720s)$   \nFigure 10–24  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes, titled \"Imag Axis\" and \"Real Axis,\" which are not clearly labeled. The Imag Axis is situated on the y-axis, while the Real Axis is positioned on the x-axis.\n\n**Graph Features:**\n\n*   **Axes:** The graph features two axes, one vertical (y-axis) and one horizontal (x-axis).\n*   **Labels:** The labels \"Imag Axis\" and \"Real Axis\" are not clearly visible or legible.\n*   **Gridlines:** A grid pattern is superimposed over the graph, comprising dotted lines that intersect at regular intervals.\n*   **Data Points:** Several data points are scattered throughout the graph, although their exact nature and significance cannot be determined due to the lack of clear labels.\n\n**Visual Analysis:**\n\nThe graph appears to be a scatter plot or a line graph, but without clear labels or context, it is challenging to interpret its meaning. The presence of gridlines suggests that the data may be intended for comparison across different categories or time periods. However, without additional information, it is difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from this graph.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the image presents a graph with two axes and scattered data points, but the lack of clear labels and context makes it challenging to understand its purpose or significance. Further analysis would require additional information about the variables being measured and the relationships between them.  \nRoot-Locus Plot of $(12.109s^{3}+136.343s^{2}+477.375s+506.25)/$ $(s^{5}+16s^{4}+86.1406s^{3}+165.406s^{2}+51.3744s)$   \n(a) Root-locus plot of the system with observer poles at $s=-10$ and $s=-10$ ;(b) root-locus plot of the system with observer poles at $s=-4.5$ and $s=-4.5$ .  \n\n# Comments  \n\n1. In designing regulator systems,note that if the dominant controller poles are placed far to the left of the $j\\omega$ axis, the elements of the state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ will become large. Large gain values will make the actuator output become large, so that saturation may take place. Then the designed system will not behave as designed.   \n2. Also, by placing the observer poles far to the left of the $j\\omega$ axis, the observer controller becomes unstable,although the closed-loop system is stable.An unstable observer controller is not acceptable.   \n3. If the observer controller becomes unstable, move the observer poles to the right in the left-half $s$ plane until the observer controller becomes stable.Also,the desired closed-loop pole locations may need to be modified.   \n4. Note that if the observer poles are placed far to the left of the jvaxis, the bandwidth of the observer will increase and will cause noise problems. If there is a serious noise problem, the observer poles should not be placed too far to the left of the jvaxis.The general requirement is that the bandwidth should be sufficiently low so that the sensor noise will not become a problem.   \n5. The bandwidth of the system with the minimum-order observer is higher than that of the system with the full-order observer, provided that the multiple observer poles are placed at the same place for both observers. If the sensor noise is a serious problem, use of a full-order observer is recomnended.  \n\n# 10–7 DESIGN OF CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH OBSERVERS  \n\nIn Section 10–6 we discussed the design of regulator systems with observers.(The systems did not have reference or command inputs.) In this section we consider the design of control systems with observers when the systems have reference inputs or command inputs. The output of the control system must follow the input that is time varying. In following the command input, the system must exhibit satisfactory performance (a reasonable rise time, overshoot, settling time, and so on).  \n\nIn this section we consider control systems that are designed by use of the poleplacement-with-observer approach. Specifically, we consider control systems using observer controllers. In Section 10–6 we discussed regulator systems, whose block diagram is shown in Figure 10–25. This system has no reference input, or $r\\,=\\,0$ .When the system has a reference input, several different block diagram configurations are conceivable, each having an observer controller.Two of these configurations are shown in Figures 10–26 (a) and (b); we shall consider them in this section.  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the components of an observer-based control system. The diagram is divided into several sections, each representing a distinct element within the system.\n\n*   **Input Block**\n    *   The input block is labeled as \"r = 0\" and serves as the starting point for the signal flow.\n    *   It indicates that the input to the system is set to zero.\n*   **Summing Junction**\n    *   The summing junction is represented by a circle with an arrow pointing towards it from both sides of the diagram.\n    *   This element combines two signals and produces their difference as output.\n*   **Observer Controller**\n    *   The observer controller block is denoted as \"u\" and plays a crucial role in regulating the system's dynamics.\n    *   It takes the output of the summing junction and applies it to control the behavior of the plant.\n*   **Plant**\n    *   The plant is represented by a rectangular box labeled as \"y\".\n    *   It is the core component of the system, where the input signal is processed according to its own dynamics.\n*   **Output**\n    *   The output block is not explicitly shown but can be inferred as the final result of the observer-based control system.\n    *   The output represents the response of the plant to the input signal and controller action.\n\nIn summary, the diagram illustrates a basic observer-based control system consisting of an input block, summing junction, observer controller, plant, and implicit output. This setup enables the regulation of the plant's dynamics through feedback control mechanisms. 10–25 Regulator system.  \n\nThe image presents two distinct control systems, each comprising a plant and an observer controller. The top diagram illustrates a closed-loop system, while the bottom one depicts an open-loop configuration.\n\n**Top Diagram: Closed-Loop System**\n\n*   **Plant:** Represented by a box labeled \"Plant\"\n*   **Observer Controller:** Positioned to the right of the plant, denoted as \"Observer controller\"\n*   **Input and Output Signals:**\n    *   A signal labeled \"r\" enters the system from the left\n    *   The output of the plant is represented by \"y\", which is fed back into the observer controller\n    *   An additional input \"u\" is also present, influencing the plant's behavior\n\n**Bottom Diagram: Open-Loop System**\n\n*   **Plant:** Identical to the top diagram, with the same label \"Plant\"\n*   **Observer Controller:** Located above the plant in this configuration, still labeled as \"Observer controller\"\n*   **Input and Output Signals:**\n    *   The input signal \"r\" enters the system from the left\n    *   An additional input \"u\" is present, influencing the plant's behavior\n\nIn both diagrams, the observer controller plays a crucial role in monitoring and adjusting the output of the plant based on feedback signals. This suggests that the purpose of these systems is to regulate or control some aspect of the plant's operation.\n\nThe image does not provide explicit labels or annotations for the various components beyond their basic functions as inputs, outputs, and controllers. Therefore, without additional context or information about the specific application or industry being represented, it is challenging to offer more detailed insights into the purpose or functionality of these systems beyond their general composition and relationship between the plant and observer controller. 10–26 (a) Control system with observer controller in the feedforward path; (b) Control system with observer controller in the feedback path.   \n(b)  \n\nConfiguration 1: Consider the system shown in Figure 10–27. In this system the reference input is simply added at the summing point.We would like to design the observer controller such that in the unit-step response the maximum overshoot is less than $30\\%$ and the settling time is about 5 sec.  \n\nIn what follows we first design a regulator system.Then,using the observer controller designed, we simply add the reference input $r$ at the summing point.  \n\nBefore we design the observer controller, we need to obtain a state-space representation of the plant. Since  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}}={\\frac{1}{s(s^{2}+1)}}\n$$  \n\nwe obtain  \n\n$$\n\\\"+\\dot{y}\\,=\\,u\n$$  \n\nBy choosing the state variables as  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}=y}\\\\ {x_{2}=\\dot{y}}\\\\ {x_{3}=\\ddot{y}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwe get  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{B}u}\\\\ {\\qquad\\mathrm{y}=\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{x}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of an observer-based control system, which is a type of feedback control system. The diagram shows the various components involved in the system and how they interact with each other.\n\n**Components:**\n\n*   **Plant:** This is the process being controlled by the controller.\n*   **Observer Controller:** This is the component that generates the control signal based on the output of the observer.\n*   **Observer:** This is the component that estimates the state of the plant using the input and output signals.\n\n**Blocks:**\n\n*   **r:** This represents the reference signal, which is the desired output of the system.\n*   **u:** This represents the control signal generated by the controller.\n*   **y:** This represents the output signal of the system.\n*   **x:** This represents the state vector of the plant.\n\n**Arrows:**\n\n*   The arrow pointing from r to the observer controller indicates that the reference signal is used as input for the controller.\n*   The arrow pointing from u to the plant indicates that the control signal is applied to the plant.\n*   The arrow pointing from y to the observer indicates that the output signal of the system is fed back to the observer.\n*   The arrow pointing from x to the observer controller indicates that the estimated state vector is used as input for the controller.\n\n**Overall System:**\n\nThe overall system consists of three main components:\n\n1.  **Plant:** This is the process being controlled by the controller.\n2.  **Observer Controller:** This generates the control signal based on the output of the observer.\n3.  **Observer:** This estimates the state of the plant using the input and output signals.\n\nThe system works as follows:\n\n*   The reference signal (r) is fed into the observer controller, which generates a control signal (u).\n*   The control signal (u) is applied to the plant, which produces an output signal (y).\n*   The output signal (y) is fed back to the observer, which estimates the state of the plant using the input and output signals.\n*   The estimated state vector (x) is used as input for the controller, which generates a new control signal (u).\n\nThis process continues until the desired performance criteria are met.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe block diagram shows a typical observer-based control system, where the observer estimates the state of the plant and the controller generates the control signal based on this estimate. This type of system is commonly used in various applications such as robotics, process control, and aerospace engineering. 10–27 Control system with observer controller in the feedforward path.  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{0}&{1}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{0}&{1}\\\\ {0}&{-1}&{0}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{B}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{0}\\\\ {0}\\\\ {1}\\end{array}\\right]},\\qquad\\mathbf{C}=[1}&{0}&{0]\n$$  \n\nNext, we choose the desired closed-loop poles for pole placement at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-1\\,+\\,j,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-1\\,-\\,j,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-8\n$$  \n\nand the desired observer poles at  \n\n$$\ns\\,=\\,-4,\\qquad s\\,=\\,-4\n$$  \n\nThe state feedback gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and the observer gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}_{e}$ can be obtained as follows:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c c}{\\mathbf{K}=[16}&{17}&{10]}\\\\ {\\mathbf{K}_{e}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}{8}\\\\ {15}\\end{array}\\right]}&{}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nSee MATLAB Program 10–16.  \n\nThis image is a screen capture of two separate computer program blocks, both written in MATLAB.

The diagram is divided into two main sections: the top section represents the plant, and the bottom section represents the controller.\n\n**Top Section: Plant**\n\n*   A box labeled \"Plant\" contains an equation that describes the system being controlled.\n    *   The equation is given by $y = 302s^2 + 303s + 256$.\n*   An arrow points from the plant to a box labeled \"Observer Controller\".\n*   Another arrow points from the observer controller back to the plant.\n\n**Bottom Section: Observer Controller**\n\n*   A box labeled \"Observer Controller\" contains an equation that describes how the observer estimates the state of the system.\n    *   The equation is given by $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = 302\\frac{dy}{dt} + 303y$.\n*   An arrow points from the plant to the observer controller, indicating that the output of the plant is fed into the observer.\n*   Another arrow points from the observer back to the plant, indicating that the estimated state of the system is used to control the plant.\n\n**Arrows and Labels**\n\n*   Arrows are used to represent the flow of signals between components in the diagram.\n*   Labels are used to identify each component and provide context for the equations.\n\nIn summary, the image shows a block diagram of an observer-based control system, where the observer estimates the state of the plant using its output and provides feedback to the controller. The equations provided describe how the observer works and how it interacts with the plant. 10–28 Regulator system with observer controller.   \nFigure 10–29 Control system with observer controller in the feedforward path.  \n\nFigure 10–28 shows the block diagram of the regulator system just designed. Figure 10–29 shows the block diagram of a possible configuration of the control system based on the regulator system shown in Figure 10–28. The unit-step response curve for this control system is shown in Figure 10–30.The maximum overshoot is about $28\\%$ and the settling time is about 4.5 sec.Thus, the designed system satisfies the design requirements.  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with two distinct sections, each featuring a single black line. The top section displays the output y as a function of time t (in seconds), while the bottom section remains blank.\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n*   **Y-axis:** labeled \"Output\" and ranging from 0 to 1.4\n*   **X-axis:** labeled \"t (sec)\" and spanning from 0 to 10\n*   **Black Line:** represents the output y as a function of time t, exhibiting a peak at approximately 1 second\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n*   **Blank:** devoid of any data or labels\n\nIn summary, the image features a single line graph in the top section, which displays the output y as a function of time t, peaking at approximately 1 second. The bottom section remains blank, lacking any data or labels. 10–30 Unit-step response of the control system shown in Figure 10–29.  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical equation, specifically an algebraic expression that represents a relationship between variables.

The inclusion of arrows and labels provides additional context, helping to clarify the interactions between these components and their roles in the overall expression. 10–31 Control system with observer controller in the feedback path.  \n\nConfiguration 2: A different configuration of the control system is shown in Figure 10–31.The observer controller is placed in the feedback path.The input $r$ is introduced into the closed-loop system through the box with gain $N.$ . From this block diagram, the closed-loop transfer function is obtained as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{N\\!\\left(s^{2}+18s\\,+113\\right)}{s\\!\\left(s^{2}+1\\right)\\!\\left(s^{2}+18s\\,+113\\right)\\,+\\,302s^{2}\\,+\\,303s\\,+\\,256}\n$$  \n\nWe determine the value of constant $N$ such that for a unit-step input $r$ , the output $y$ is unity as $t$ approaches infinity.Thus we choose  \n\n$$\nN=\\frac{256}{113}=2.2655\n$$  \n\nThe unit-step response of the system is shown in Figure 10–32. Notice that the maximum overshoot is very small, approximately $4\\%$ .The settling time is about 5 sec.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with two axes: x and y. The x-axis is labeled \"t (sec)\" and features values ranging from 0 to 10 seconds, while the y-axis is labeled \"Output\" and spans from 0 to 1.4.\n\n**Graph Details**\n\n*   The graph displays a single curved line that begins at approximately (0, 0) and ends at around (10, 1).\n*   The curve exhibits a gradual increase in value over time, starting with a slow rise before accelerating towards the end.\n*   Notably, the curve does not reach its maximum value of 1.4 but instead plateaus at approximately 1.\n\n**Overall Impression**\n\nThe graph appears to depict a mathematical function or relationship between time and output values, with the curved line representing this connection. The absence of any additional information or labels on the graph makes it challenging to provide further insights into its meaning or significance. 10–32 The unit-step response of the system shown in Figure 10–31. (The closed-loop poles for pole placement are at $s=-1\\pm j$ ,$s\\,=\\,-8,$ .The observer poles are at $s=-4$ ,$s=-4.$ )  \n\nComments. We considered two possible configurations for the closed-loop control systems using observer controllers.As stated earlier, other configurations are possible.  \n\nThe first configuration,which places the observer controller in the feedforward path,generally gives a fairly large overshoot.The second configuration,which places the observer controller in the feedback path,gives a smaller overshoot.This response curve is quite similar to that of the system designed by the pole-placement approach without using the observer controller. See the unit-step response curve of the system, shown in Figure 10–33, designed by the pole-placement approach without observer.Here the desired closed-loop poles used are  \n\n$$\ns\\,=-1\\,+\\,j,\\qquad s\\,=-1\\,-\\,j,\\qquad s\\,=-8\n$$  \n\n# Figure 10–33  \n\nThe image presents a line graph with a single curve, accompanied by numerical labels and grid lines.

The absence of a title and the lack of explicit details about the curve's underlying function make it difficult to provide further analysis or insights beyond what is visually presented.  \nUnit-Step Response of System without Observer   \nThe unit-step response of the control system designed by the pole placement approach without observer. (The closed-loop poles are at $s\\,=\\,-1\\,\\pm\\,j,s\\,=\\,-8.$ )  \n\nThe image presents two Bode plots, each displaying a magnitude and phase response for a system. The top plot is labeled \"System 1\" and features a magnitude response that remains constant at approximately -30 dB across all frequencies up to 10 rad/sec. Beyond this point, the magnitude decreases linearly with frequency.\n\nIn contrast, the bottom plot is labeled \"System 2\" and exhibits a more complex behavior. The magnitude response initially increases slightly before reaching a peak around 1 rad/sec and then decreases exponentially. Meanwhile, the phase response for both systems remains relatively flat until approximately 10 rad/sec, after which it begins to decrease linearly with frequency.\n\nThe plots provide valuable insights into the frequency domain characteristics of each system, allowing engineers to analyze their performance and make informed design decisions. 10–34 Bode diagrams of closed-loop system 1 (shown in Figure 10–29) and closedloop system 2 (shown in Figure 10–31).  \n\nNote that, in these two systems, the rise time and settling time are determined primarily by the desired closed-loop poles for pole placement. (See Figures 10–32 and 10–33.)  \n\nThe Bode diagrams of closed-loop system 1 (shown in Figure 10–29) and closedloop system 2 (shown in Figure 10–31) are shown in Figure 10–34. From this figure, we find that the bandwidth of system 1 is 5 rad 'sec and that of system 2 is 1.3 rad 'sec.  \n\n# Summary of State-Space Design Method  \n\n1. The state-space design method based on the pole-placement-combined-withobserver approach is very powerful.It is a time-domain method.The desired closedloop poles can be arbitrarily placed, provided the plant is completely state controllable.   \n2. If not all state variables can be measured, an observer must be incorporated to estimate the unmeasurable state variables.   \n3. In designing a system using the pole-placement approach, several different sets of desired closed-loop poles need be considered, the response characteristics compared, and the best one chosen.   \n4. The bandwidth of the observer controller is generally large, because we choose observer poles far to the left in the $s$ plane. A large bandwidth passes highfrequency noises and causes the noise problem.   \n5. Adding an observer to the system generally reduces the stability margin. In some cases, an observer controller may have zero(s) in the right-half $s$ plane, which means that the controller may be stable but of nonminimum phase. In other cases, the controller may have pole(s) in the right-half $s$ plane—that is, the controller is unstable.Then the designed system may become conditionally stable.   \n6. When the system is designed by the pole-placement-with-observer approach, it is advisable to check the stability margins (phase margin and gain margin), using a  \n\nfrequency-response method. If the system designed has poor stability margins, it is possible that the designed system may become unstable if the mathematical model involves uncertainties.  \n\n7. Note that for minimum-order observer is used frequency-response methods) yield low-order compensators (first or second order). Since the observer-bas nth-order systems, classical design methods (root-locus and CDfor an s are nnth-order system, the designed system th-order DCor $(N\\mathrm{~-~}m)$ th-order if the will become 2 nth order $\\left[\\mathrm{or}\\,(2n\\mathrm{~-~}\\bar{m})\\right]$ th order .Since lower-order compensators are cheaper than higher-order ones, the designer should first apply classical methods and, if no suitable compensators can be determined, then try the pole-placementwith-observer design approach presented in this chapter.  \n\n# 10–8 QUADRATIC OPTIMAL REGULATOR SYSTEMS  \n\nAn advantage of the quadratic optimal control method over the pole-placement method is that the former provides a systematic way of computing the state feedback control gain matrix.  \n\nQuadratic Optimal Regulator Problems. We shall now consider the optimal regulator problem that, given the system equation  \n\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{u}\n$$  \n\ndetermines the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ of the optimal control vector  \n\n$$\n{\\mathbf u}(t)\\,=-{\\mathbf K}{\\mathbf x}(t)\n$$  \n\nso as to minimize the performance index  \n\n$$\nJ\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{\\infty}({\\bf x}^{*}{\\bf Q}{\\bf x}\\,+\\,{\\bf u}^{*}{\\bf R}{\\bf u})\\,d t\n$$  \n\nwhere Qis a positive-definite (or positive-semidefinite) Hermitian or real symmetric matrix and $\\mathbf{R}$ is a positive-definite Hermitian or real symmetric matrix. Note that the second term on the right-hand side of Equation (10–114) accounts for the expenditure of the energy of the control signals. The matrices $\\mathbf{Q}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ determine the relative importance of the error and the expenditure of this energy. In this problem, we assume that the control vector ${\\bf\\delta u}(t)$ is unconstrained.  \n\nAs will be seen later,the linear control law given by Equation (10–113) is the optimal control law. Therefore, if the unknown elements of the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ are determined so as to minimize the performance index, then ${\\mathbf u}(t)\\,=\\,-{\\mathbf K}{\\mathbf x}(t)$ is optimal for any initial state ${\\bf x}(0)$ .The block diagram showing the optimal configuration is shown in Figure 10–35.  \n\nFigure 10–35   \nOptimal regulator system.  \n\nThe image depicts a simple flowchart or diagram with two boxes and an arrow connecting them. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate a process or system, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine its specific meaning.\n\n* Two boxes:\n\t+ The top box has the equation \"u = Ax + Bu\" written inside it.\n\t+ The bottom box contains the letter \"-K\".\n* An arrow connecting the two boxes:\n\t+ The arrow points from the top box to the bottom box, indicating a flow or transfer of information from one stage to another.\n\nThe diagram appears to represent some kind of mathematical model or algorithm, where the output of one stage (u) is used as input for another stage (-K), with intermediate calculations involving matrices A and B. However, without further explanation or context, it's challenging to provide a more detailed interpretation of this diagram.  \n\nNow let us solve the optimization problem. Substituting Equation (10–113) into Equation (10–112), we obtain  \n\n$$\n{\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}\\mathrm{~-~}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nIn the following derivations, we assume that the matrix $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ is stable, or that the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ have negative real parts.  \n\nSubstituting Equation (10–113) into Equation (10–114) yields  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{J=\\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\infty}({\\bf x}^{*}{\\bf Q}{\\bf x}+{\\bf x}^{*}{\\bf K}^{*}{\\bf R}{\\bf K}{\\bf x})\\,d t}}\\\\ {{\\displaystyle~~=\\,\\int_{0}^{\\infty}{\\bf x}^{*}({\\bf Q}\\,+\\,{\\bf K}^{*}{\\bf R}{\\bf K}){\\bf x}\\,d t}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nLet us set  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}^{*}(\\mathbf{Q}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}=-\\,{\\frac{d}{d t}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}\\right)\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{P}$ is a positive-definite Hermitian or real symmetric matrix.Then we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}^{*}(\\mathbf{Q}+\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}=-\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}=-\\mathbf{x}^{*}\\big[(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})^{*}\\mathbf{P}+\\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\big]\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nComparing both sides of this last equation and noting that this equation must hold true for any $\\mathbf{X}$ , we require that  \n\n$$\n(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K})\\,=\\,-(\\mathbf{Q}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{K})\n$$  \n\nIt can be proved that if $\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ is a stable matrix, there exists a positive-definite matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ that satisfies Equation (10–115). (See Problem A–10–15 .)  \n\nHence our procedure is to determine the elements of $\\mathbf{P}$ from Equation (10–115) and see if it is positive definite. (Note that more than one matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ may satisfy this equation. If the system is stable, there always exists one positive-definite matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ to satisfy this equation.This means that, if we solve this equation and find one positive-definite matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ ,the system is stable.Other $\\mathbf{P}$ matrices that satisfy this equation are not positive definite and must be discarded.)  \n\nThe performance index $J$ can be evaluated as  \n\n$$\nJ\\,=\\,\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\!\\mathbf{x}^{*}(\\mathbf{Q}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{K})\\mathbf{x}\\,d t\\,=\\left.-\\mathbf{x}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}\\right|_{0}^{\\infty}=\\left.-\\mathbf{x}^{*}(\\infty)\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\,+\\,\\mathbf{x}^{*}(0)\\,\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\right|_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$  \n\nSince all eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}-\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}$ are assumed to have negative real parts, we have $\\mathbf{x}(\\infty)\\rightarrow\\mathbf{0}.$ .Therefore, we obtain  \n\n$$\nJ\\,=\\,{\\bf x}^{*}(0)\\,{\\bf P}{\\bf x}(0)\n$$  \n\nThus, the performance index $J$ can be obtained in terms of the initial condition ${\\bf x}(0)$ and $\\mathbf{P}$ .  \n\nTo obtain the solution to the quadratic optimal control problem, we proceed as follows: Since Rhas been assumed to be a positive-definite Hermitian or real symmetric matrix, we can write  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{T}^{*}\\mathbf{T}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}$ is a nonsingular matrix.Then Equation (10–115) can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\big(\\mathbf{A}^{*}-\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\big)\\mathbf{P}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{P}\\big(\\mathbf{A}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}\\big)\\,+\\,\\mathbf{Q}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{K}^{*}\\mathbf{T}^{*}\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{K}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nwhich can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}+\\mathbf{PA}+\\left[\\mathbf{TK}-(\\mathbf{T^{*}})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\right]^{*}\\!\\left[\\mathbf{TK}-(\\mathbf{T^{*}})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\right]-\\mathbf{PBR}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}+\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{0}\n$$A \\*  \n\nThe minimization of $J$ with respect to $\\mathbf{K}$ requires the minimization of  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}^{*}[\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{K}\\,-\\,(\\mathbf{T}^{*})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}]^{*}[\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{K}\\,-\\,(\\mathbf{T}^{*})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}]\\mathbf{x}\n$$  \n\nwith respect to $\\mathbf{K}$ . (See Problem A–10–16 .) Since this last expression is nonnegative, the minimum occurs when it is zero, or when  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{K}\\,=\\,(\\mathbf{T}^{*})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\n$$  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{T}^{-1}(\\mathbf{T}^{*})^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}=\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\n$$  \n\nEquation (10–117) gives the optimal matrix K.Thus,the optimal control law to the quadratic optimal control problem when the performance index is given by Equation (10–114) is linear and is given by  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(t)\\,=\\,-\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{x}(t)\\,=\\,-\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{x}(t)\n$$  \n\nThe matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ in Equation (10–117) must satisfy Equation (10–115) or the following reduced equation:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{PA}\\,-\\,\\mathbf{PBR}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}^{*}\\mathbf{P}\\,+\\,\\mathbf{Q}\\,=\\,\\mathbf{0}\n$$  \n\nEquation (10–118) is called the reduced-matrix Riccati equation.The design steps may be stated as follows:  \n\n1. Solve Equation (10–118), the reduced-matrix Riccati equation, for the matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ .[If a positive-definite matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ exists (certain systems may not have a positivedefinite matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ ), the system is stable, or matrix A -BK is stable.] 2. Substitute this matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ into Equation (10–117). The resulting matrix Kis the optimal matrix.  \n\nA design example based on this approach is given in Example 10–9.

Given any initial state ${\\bf x}(t_{0})$ ,the optimal regulator problem is to find an allowable control vector ${\\bf\\delta u}(t)$ that transfers the state to the desired region of the state space and for which the performance index is minimized. For the existence of an optimal control vector ${\\bf\\delta u}(t)$ ,the system must be completely state controllable.   \n2. The system that minimizes (or maximizes, as the case may be) the selected performance index is, by definition, optimal. Although the controller may have nothing to do with “optimality” in many practical applications, the important point is that the design based on the quadratic performance index yields a stable control system.   \n3. The characteristic of an optimal control law based on a quadratic performance index is that it is a linear function of the state variables, which implies that we need to feed back all state variables.This requires that all such variables be available for feedback. If not all state variables are available for feedback, then we need to employ a state observer to estimate unmeasurable state variables and use the estimated values to generate optimal control signals.  \n\nNote that the closed-loop poles of the system designed by the use of the quadratic optimal regulator approach can be found from  \n\n$$\n|s\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{K}|\\,=\\,0\n$$  \n\nSince these closed-loop poles correspond to the desired closed-loop poles in the pole-placement approach, the transfer functions of the observer controllers can be obtained from either Equation (10–74) if the observer is of full-order type or Equation (10–108) if the observer is of minimum-order type.  \n\n4. When the optimal control system is designed in the time domain, it is desirable to investigate the frequency-response characteristics to compensate for noise effects. The system frequency-response characteristics must be such that the system attenuates highly in the frequency range where noise and resonance of components are expected.(To compensate for noise effects,we must in some cases either modify the optimal configuration and accept suboptimal performance or modify the performance index.)   \n5. If the upper limit of integration in the performance index $J$ given by Equation (10–114) is finite, then it can be shown that the optimal control vector is still a linear function of the state variables,but with time-varying coefficients.(Therefore, the determination of the optimal control vector involves that of optimal timevarying matrices.)  \n\n# 10–9 ROBUST CONTROL SYSTEMS  \n\nSuppose that given a control object (i.e., a system with a flexible arm) we wish to design a control system. The first step in the design of a control system is to obtain a mathematical model of the control object based on the physical law. Quite often the model may be nonlinear and possibly with distributed parameters. Such a model may be difficult to analyze. It is desirable to approximate it by a linear constant-coefficient system that will approximate the actual object fairly well. Note that even though the model to be used for design purposes may be a simplified one, it is necessary that such a model must include any intrinsic character of the actual object.Assuming that we can get a model that approximates the actual system quite well, we must get a simplified model for the purpose of designing the control system that will require a compensator of lowest order possible. Thus, a model of a control object (whatever it may be) will probably include an error in the modeling process. Note that in the frequency-response approach to control systems design, we use phase and gain margins to take care of the modeling errors. However, in the state-space approach, which is based on the differential equations of the plant dynamics, no such “margins” are involved in the design process.  \n\nSince the actual plant differs from the model used in the design, a question arises whether the controller designed using a model will work satisfactorily with the actual plant. To ensure that it will do so, robust control theory has been developed since around 1980.  \n\nRobust control theory uses the assumption that the models we use in designing control systems have modeling errors.We shall present an introduction to this theory in this section. Basically, the theory assumes that there is an uncertainty or error between the actual plant and its mathematical model and includes such uncertainty or error in the design process of the control system.  \n\nSystems designed based on the robust control theory will possess the following properties:  \n\n(1) Robust stability .The control system designed is stable in the presence of perturbation.   \n(2) Robust performance .The control system exhibits predetermined response characteristics in the presence of perturbation.  \n\nThis theory requires considerations based on frequency-response analysis and timedomain analysis. Because of the mathematical complications associated with robust control theory, detailed discussion of robust control theory is beyond the scope of the senior engineering student. In this section, only introductory discussion of robust control theory is presented.  \n\nUncertain Elements in Plant Dynamics. The term uncertainty refers to the differences or errors between the model of the plant and the actual plant.  \n\nUncertain elements that may appear in practical systems may be classified as structured uncertainty and unstructured uncertainty.An example of structured uncertainty is any parametric variation in the plant dynamics, such as variations in poles and zeros of the plant transfer function. Examples of unstructured uncertainty include frequencydependent uncertainty, such as high-frequency modes that we normally neglect in modeling plant dynamics. For example, in the modeling of a flexible-arm system, the model may include a finite number of modes of oscillation.The modes of oscillation that are not included in the modeling behave as uncertainty of the system. Another example of uncertainty occurs in the linearization of a nonlinear plant. If the actual plant is nonlinear and its model is linear, then the difference acts as unstructured uncertainty.  \n\nIn this section we consider the case where the uncertainty is unstructured. In addition we assume that the plant involves only one uncertainty. (Some plants may involve multiple uncertain elements.)  \n\nIn the robust control theory, we define unstructured uncertainty as $\\Delta(s)$ . Since the exact description of $\\Delta(s)$ is unknown, we use an estimate of $\\Delta(s)$ (as to the magnitude and phase characteristics) and use this estimate in the design of the controller that stabilizes the control system. Stability of a system with unstructured uncertainty can then be examined by use of the small gain theorem to be given following the definition of the $H_{\\infty}$ norm.  \n\n$H_{\\infty}$ Norm. The $H_{\\infty}$ norm of a stable single-input–single-output system is the largest possible amplification factor of the steady-state response to sinusoidal excitation.  \n\nFor a scalar $\\Phi(s),\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}$ gives the maximum value of $|\\Phi(j\\omega)|$ .It is called the $H_{\\infty}$ norm. See Figure 10–41.  \n\nIn robust control theory we measure the magnitude of the transfer function by the $H_{\\infty}$ norm. Assume that the transfer function $\\Phi(s)$ is proper and stable. [Note that a transfer function $\\Phi(s)$ is called proper if $\\Phi(\\infty)$ is limited and definite. If $\\Phi(\\infty)=0$ , it is called strictly proper.] The $H_{\\infty}$ norm of $\\Phi(s)$ is defined by  \n\nThe image presents a mathematical representation of signal processing, comprising two distinct components:\n\n**Top Section:**\n\n*   A block diagram illustrating the process of filtering an input signal through a system.\n*   The input signal is denoted by the variable $\\omega$, while the output signal is represented by $z$.\n*   An arrow connects the input and output signals, indicating the flow of information through the system.\n\n**Bottom Section:**\n\n*   A graph displaying the magnitude response of a filter in decibels (dB) as a function of frequency.\n*   The x-axis represents the frequency range, while the y-axis denotes the magnitude response in dB.\n*   A peak is visible at the center of the graph, indicating the filter's maximum gain or attenuation.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n*   The presence of an arrow connecting the input and output signals suggests that the system is designed to process or modify the input signal in some way.\n*   The magnitude response graph reveals the filter's behavior across different frequencies, with a peak indicating a region of high gain or low attenuation. 10–41 Bode diagram and the $H_{\\infty}$ norm $\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}$ .  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}=\\overline{{\\sigma}}\\left[\\Phi(j\\omega)\\right]\n$$  \n\n$\\overline{{\\sigma}}\\left[\\Phi(j\\omega)\\right]$ means the maximum singular value of $\\left[\\Phi(j\\omega)\\right]$ . ( $\\overline{{\\sigma}}$ means $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{max}}$ .) Note that the singular value of a transfer function $\\Phi$ is defined by  \n\n$$\n\\sigma_{i}(\\Phi)\\,=\\,\\sqrt{\\lambda_{i}(\\Phi^{*}\\Phi)}\n$$  \n\nvalue. By making where $\\lambda_{i}(\\Phi^{*}\\Phi)$ is the $\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}$ i th largest eigenvalue of smaller, we make the effect of input $\\Phi^{*}\\Phi$ and it is always a non-negative real $_w$ on the output 7 7 $z$ smaller. It is frequently the case that instead of using the maximum singular value $\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}$ , we use the inequality  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}<\\gamma\n$$  \n\nand limit the magnitude of $\\Phi(s)$ by .To make the magnitude of $\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}$ small, we choose a small $\\gamma$ and require that $\\|\\Phi\\|_{\\infty}<\\gamma$ .  \n\nFigure 10–42 Closed-loop system.  \n\nThis image depicts a simple diagram featuring two rectangular boxes, each with an arrow pointing to the right. The top box contains a Greek delta symbol (Δ), while the bottom box displays a capital M. Both symbols are rendered in black font and reside within their respective boxes against a white background.\n\nThe diagram appears to be part of a larger system or process, as indicated by the arrows connecting the two boxes. This suggests that there may be additional elements or components that are not visible in this particular view.  \n\nSmall-Gain Theorem. Consider the closed-loop system shown in Figure 10–42. In the figure $\\Delta(s)$ and $M(s)$ are stable and proper transfer functions.  \n\nThe small-gain theorem states that if  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Delta(s)M(s)\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nthen this closed-loop system is stable. That is, if the $H_{\\infty}$ norm of $\\Delta(s)M(s)$ is smaller than 1, this closed-loop system is stable. This theorem is an extension of the Nyquist stability criterion.  \n\nIt is important to note that the small-gain theorem gives a sufficient condition for stability.That is, a system may be stable even if it does not satisfy this theorem. However, if a system satisfies the small-gain theorem, it is always stable.  \n\nSystem with Unstructured Uncertainty. In some cases an unstructured uncertainty error may be considered multiplicative such that  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{G}\\,=\\,G(1\\,+\\,\\Delta_{m})\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\widetilde{G}$ is the true plant dynamics and $G$ is the model plant dynamics. In other cases an unstructured uncertainty error may be considered additive such that  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{G}\\,=\\,G\\,+\\,\\Delta_{a}\n$$  \n\nIn either case we assume that the norm of $\\Delta_{m}$ or $\\Delta_{a}$ is bounded such that  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Delta_{m}\\|\\,<\\,\\gamma_{m}\\,,\\qquad\\|\\Delta_{a}\\|\\,<\\,\\gamma_{a}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\gamma_{m}$ and $\\gamma_{a}$ are positive constants.  \n\n# EXAMPLE 10–14  \n\nConsider a control system with unstructured multiplicative uncertainty.We shall consider robust stability and robust performance of the system. (A system with unstructured additive uncertainty will be discussed in Problem A–10–18 .)  \n\nRobust Stability. Let us define  \n\n$\\widetilde G=$ true plant dynamics   \n$G=$ model of plant dynamics   \n$\\Delta_{m}=$ unstructured multiplicative uncertainty  \n\nWe assume that $\\Delta_{m}$ is stable and its upper bound is known.We also assume that $\\widetilde{G}$ and $G$ are related by  \n\n$$\n\\widetilde{G}\\,=\\,G(I\\,+\\,\\Delta_{m})\n$$  \n\nConsider the system shown in Figure 10–43(a). Let us examine the transfer function between point $A$ and point $B$ . Notice that Figure 10–43(a) can be redrawn as shown in Figure 10-43(b).The transfer function between point $A$ and point $B$ can be given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{K G}{1+K G}}=(1\\,+\\,K G)^{-1}\\,K G\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n(1\\,+\\,K G)^{-1}\\,K G=T\n$$  \n\nUsing Equation (10–121) we can redraw Figure 10–43(b) as Figure 10–43(c).Applying the smallgain theorem to the system consisting of $\\Delta_{m}$ and $T$ as shown in Figure 10–43(c), we obtain the condition for stability to be  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Delta_{m}T\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nIn general, it is impossible to precisely model $\\Delta_{m}$ .Therefore, let us use a scalar transfer function $W_{m}(j\\omega)$ such that  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{\\sigma}}\\{\\Delta_{m}(j\\omega)\\}<|W_{m}(j\\omega)|\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\overline{{\\sigma}}\\{\\Delta_{m}(j\\omega)\\}$ is the largest singular value of $\\Delta_{m}(j\\omega)$ .  \n\nConsider, instead of Inequality (10–122), the following inequality:  \n\n$$\n\\|W_{m}T\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nIf Inequality (10–123) holds true, Inequality (10–122) will always be satisfied. By making the $H_{\\infty}$ norm of $W_{m}T$ to be less than 1, we obtain the controller $K$ that will make the system stable.  \n\nSuppose that we cut the line at point $A$ in Figure 10–43(a). Then we obtain Figure 10–43(d). Replacing $\\Delta_{m}$ by $W_{m}I$ , we obtain Figure 10–43(e). Redrawing Figure 10–43(e), we obtain Figure 10–43(f). Figure 10–43(f) is called a generalized plant diagram .  \n\nReferring to Equation (10–121), $T$ is given by  \n\n$$\nT=\\frac{K G}{1+K G}\n$$  \n\nThen Inequality (10–123) can be rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\left\\|\\frac{W_{m}K(s)G(s)}{1+\\K(s)G(s)}\\right\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nClearly, for a stable plant model $G(s)$ ,$K(s)\\,=\\,0$ will satisfy Inequality (10–125). However, $K(s)\\,=\\,0$ is not the desirable transfer function for the controller. To find an acceptable transfer function for $K(s)$ , we may add another condition—for example, that the resulting system will have robust performance such that the system output follows the input with minimum error, or another reasonable condition. In what follows we shall obtain the condition for robust performance.  \n\nThe image presents a collection of six distinct diagrams, each featuring a unique set of symbols and lines. The diagrams are arranged in two rows of three, with each diagram labeled with a letter from \"a\" to \"f\".\n\n*   **Diagram (a)**\n    *   This diagram consists of various symbols connected by arrows.\n    *   It includes boxes with letters inside them, such as G, B, and K, as well as other shapes like circles and squares.\n    *   The diagram appears to be a flowchart or network diagram, possibly representing some kind of system or process.\n*   **Diagram (b)**\n    *   This diagram is similar in style to the first one, with boxes and lines connected by arrows.\n    *   It includes symbols such as triangles, squares, and circles, which may represent different components or nodes within a larger system.\n    *   The diagram could be interpreted as a flowchart or a network diagram, possibly illustrating how information flows through a particular process or system.\n*   **Diagram (c)**\n    *   This diagram features a series of connected boxes with letters inside them, including G, B, and K.\n    *   It also includes various shapes like triangles, squares, and circles, which may represent different components or nodes within the system.\n    *   The diagram seems to be a flowchart or network diagram, possibly showing how information flows through a particular process or system.\n*   **Diagram (d)**\n    *   This diagram is similar in style to the previous ones, with boxes and lines connected by arrows.\n    *   It includes symbols such as triangles, squares, and circles, which may represent different components or nodes within a larger system.\n    *   The diagram could be interpreted as a flowchart or network diagram, possibly illustrating how information flows through a particular process or system.\n*   **Diagram (e)**\n    *   This diagram features a series of connected boxes with letters inside them, including G, B, and K.\n    *   It also includes various shapes like triangles, squares, and circles, which may represent different components or nodes within the system.\n    *   The diagram seems to be a flowchart or network diagram, possibly showing how information flows through a particular process or system.\n*   **Diagram (f)**\n    *   This diagram is similar in style to the previous ones, with boxes and lines connected by arrows.\n    *   It includes symbols such as triangles, squares, and circles, which may represent different components or nodes within a larger system.\n    *   The diagram could be interpreted as a flowchart or network diagram, possibly illustrating how information flows through a particular process or system.\n\nIn summary, the image presents six diagrams that appear to be flowcharts or network diagrams. Each diagram features various symbols and shapes connected by arrows, which may represent different components or nodes within a larger system. While it is difficult to provide a detailed explanation of what each diagram represents without further context, they seem to illustrate how information flows through a particular process or system.  \n\n# Figure 10–43  \n\n(a) Block diagram of a system with unstructured multiplicative uncertainty;   \n(b)–(d) successive modifications of the block diagram of (a);   \n(e) block diagram showing a generalized plant with unstructured multiplicative uncertainty;   \n(f) generalized plant diagram.  \n\nRobust Performance.

Suppose that we want the output $y(t)$ to follow the input $r(t)$ as closely as possible, or we wish to have  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\to\\infty}\\left[r(t)\\,-\\,y(t)\\right]\\;=\\;\\operatorname*{lim}_{t\\to\\infty}e(t)\\;\\to0\n$$  \n\nSince the transfer function $Y(s)/R(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}\\;=\\;{\\frac{K G}{1\\;+\\;K G}}\n$$  \n\nwe have  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{E(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{R(s)\\,-\\,Y(s)}{R(s)}}=1\\,-\\,{\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}}={\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,K G}}\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{1\\,+\\,K G}}=S\n$$  \n\nwhere $S$ is commonly called the sensitivity function and $T$ defined by Equation (10–124) is called the complementary sensitivity function. In this robust performance problem we want to make the $H_{\\infty}$ norm of $S$ smaller than the desired transfer function $W_{s}^{-1}$ or $\\|\\boldsymbol{S}\\|_{\\infty}<W_{s}^{-1}$ which can be written as  \n\n$$\n\\|W_{s}S\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nCombining Inequalities (10–123) and (10–126), we get  \n\n$$\n\\left\\|W_{m}T\\right\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nwhere $T\\,+\\,S\\,=\\,1$ ,or  \n\n$$\n\\left\\|{\\cal W}_{m}(s)\\,\\frac{K(s){\\cal G}(s)}{1+K(s){\\cal G}(s)}\\right\\|_{\\;\\;<\\;1}<1\n$$  \n\nOur problem then becomes to find $K(s)$ that will satisfy Inequality (10–127). Note that depending on the chosen $W_{m}(s)$ and $W_{s}(s)$ there may be many $K(s)$ that satisfy Inequality (10–127), or may be no $K(s)$ that satisfies Inequality (10–127). Such a robust control problem using Inequality (10–127) is called a mixed-sensitivity problem.  \n\nFigure 10–45(a) is a generalized plant diagram, where two conditions (robust stability and robust performance) are specified.A simplified version of this diagram is shown in Figure 10–45(b).  \n\nThe image presents a block diagram illustrating the flow of signals through a system, comprising various components and connections. The key elements are:\n\n*   **Input Signal**: \n    *   Represented by the arrow labeled \"r\" at the top left\n    *   Serves as the starting point for the signal processing sequence\n*   **Adder/Subtractor**:\n    *   Denoted by a circle with an \"X\" inside, positioned below and to the right of the input signal\n    *   Performs addition or subtraction operations based on the input signals\n*   **Transfer Function (G(s))**:\n    *   Indicated by a box containing the notation \"G(s)\" to its left\n    *   Represents a mathematical function that transforms the output of the adder/subtractor into another signal\n*   **Unity Feedback Loop**:\n    *   Comprises two arrows forming a loop, originating from the output of G(s) and returning to the input of G(s)\n    *   Introduces feedback into the system, allowing the processed signal to influence its own processing\n\nIn summary, the block diagram depicts a basic control system architecture featuring an adder/subtractor as the primary component. The transfer function G(s) processes the output of this component, and the unity feedback loop ensures that the system's performance is influenced by its own output. 10–44 Closed-loop system.  \n\nThe image presents a flowchart illustrating the process of converting an input signal to an output signal, with various components and symbols used to represent different stages of the conversion. The chart is divided into two main sections: (a) and (b), each representing a distinct part of the overall process.\n\n*   **Section (a)**\n\n    *   This section shows the initial stage of the conversion process, where an input signal is fed into a system.\n        *   The input signal is represented by the symbol \"u\".\n        *   The system consists of several components, including:\n            *   A gain block labeled \"G\", which amplifies or attenuates the input signal.\n            *   An adder block labeled \"+\", which combines the output of the gain block with another signal.\n            *   A delay block labeled \"z^(-1)\", which introduces a time delay in the signal path.\n    *   The output of this section is fed into the next stage, represented by Section (b).\n*   **Section (b)**\n\n    *   This section represents the final stage of the conversion process, where the output signal is generated based on the input signal and other factors.\n        *   The output signal is represented by the symbol \"y\".\n        *   The system consists of several components, including:\n            *   A multiplier block labeled \"*\", which multiplies the output of Section (a) with another signal.\n            *   An adder block labeled \"+\", which combines the result of the multiplication with another signal.\n            *   A saturation block labeled \"sat\", which limits the magnitude of the output signal.\n\nIn summary, the flowchart illustrates a complex process involving multiple stages and components to convert an input signal into an output signal. The chart provides a clear visual representation of the relationships between these components and how they contribute to the overall conversion process. 10–45 (a) Generalized plant diagram; (b) simplfied version of the generalized plant diagram shown in (a).  \n\nFinding Transfer Function $z(s)/w(s)$ from a Generalized Plant Diagram. Consider the generalized plant diagram shown in Figure 10–46.  \n\nIn this diagram $w(s)$ is the exogenous disturbance and $u(s)$ is the manipulated variable. $z(s)$ is the controlled variable and $y(s)$ is the observed variable.  \n\nConsider this control system consisting of the generalized plant $P(s)$ and the controller $K(s)$ .The equation that relates the outputs $z(s)$ and $y(s)$ and the inputs $w(s)$ and $u(s)$ of the generalized plant $P(s)$ is  \n\n$$\n{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{z(s)}\\\\ {y(s)}\\end{array}\\right]}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{P_{11}}&{P_{12}}\\\\ {P_{21}}&{P_{22}}\\end{array}\\right]}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l}{w(s)}\\\\ {u(s)}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nThe equation that relates $u(s)$ and $y(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\nu(s)\\,=\\,K(s)y(s)\n$$  \n\nDefine the transfer function that relates the controlled variable $\\mathbf{z}(\\mathbf{s})$ to the exogenous disturbance $w(s)$ as $\\Phi(s)$ .Then  \n\n$$\nz(s)\\,=\\,\\Phi(s)w(s)\n$$  \n\nFigure 10–46   \nA generalized plant diagram.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram, which is a visual representation of a system's components and their interconnections. The diagram consists of several blocks connected by arrows, indicating the flow of signals or variables between them.\n\n*   **Blocks:**\n    *   There are six blocks in total, each representing a distinct component or process within the system.\n        *   **P(s)**: This block is likely a transfer function or a mathematical model that represents the behavior of one of the system's components. The \"(s)\" notation suggests it may be related to Laplace transforms or frequency domain analysis.\n        *   **K(s)**: Similar to **P(s)**, this block also represents a transfer function or a mathematical model for another component in the system.\n        *   **z**: This block could represent an input signal or variable that is fed into one of the components. The \"z\" notation might imply it's related to discrete-time signals or Z-transforms.\n        *   **w**: Another input or variable, represented by the label \"**w**\". Its role in the system would depend on its connection points within the diagram.\n        *   **u**: This block seems to represent an output signal or variable resulting from some combination of the inputs and other components' actions. The \"u\" notation might suggest it's related to a specific type of analysis or modeling.\n        *   **y**: The final output, represented by \"**y**\". Like \"**u**\", its behavior would depend on how it integrates with the rest of the system.\n\n*   **Connections and Arrows:**\n    *   Each block is connected to others via arrows, indicating the flow of signals or variables. For instance:\n        *   An arrow connects \"**P(s)**\" directly to \"**K(s)**\", suggesting there's a direct relationship between these two components.\n        *   Another arrow links \"**z**\" to \"**P(s)**\", implying that **z** influences the behavior modeled by **P(s)**.\n        *   There are also arrows connecting \"**w**\" and \"**u**\" with various other blocks, showing how inputs affect outputs across different parts of the system.\n\n*   **Labels and Notations:**\n    *   The use of \"(s)\" in \"**P(s)**\" and \"**K(s)**\" suggests these models might be described in terms of Laplace transforms or frequency domain analysis. This implies the diagram is analyzing systems where time-domain signals are transformed into their frequency-domain representations.\n    *   The notation \"**z**\", \"**w**\", \"**u**\", and \"**y**\" likely corresponds to variables or signals within the system's analysis framework, possibly aligned with Z-transforms for discrete-time signals.\n\nIn summary, this block diagram illustrates a complex interplay between various components of a system, each potentially modeled using different mathematical tools such as Laplace transforms or Z-transforms. The connections between these blocks highlight how inputs affect outputs across the entire system, offering insights into its behavior in both time and frequency domains.  \n\nNote that $\\Phi(s)$ can be determined as follows: Since  \n\nwe obtain  \n\nHence  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{z(s)\\,=\\,P_{11}w(s)\\,+\\,P_{12}u(s)}}\\\\ {{\\ }}\\\\ {{y(s)\\,=\\,P_{21}w(s)\\,+\\,P_{22}u(s)}}\\\\ {{\\ }}\\\\ {{u(s)\\,=\\,K(s)y(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nor  \n\nTherefore,  \n\nHence,  \n\n$$\ny(s)\\,=\\,P_{21}w(s)\\,+\\,P_{22}K(s)y(s)\n$$  \n\n$$\n[I\\,-\\,P_{22}K(s)]y(s)\\,=\\,P_{21}w(s)\n$$  \n\n$$\ny(s)\\,=\\,[I\\,-\\,P_{22}K(s)]^{-1}P_{21}w(s)\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{z(s)\\,=\\,P_{11}w(s)\\,+\\,P_{12}K(s)[I\\,-\\,P_{22}K(s)]^{-1}P_{21}w(s)}}\\\\ {{\\,}}\\\\ {{=\\,\\{P_{11}\\,+\\,P_{12}K(s)[I\\,-\\,P_{22}K(s)]^{-1}P_{21}\\}w(s)}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\n$$\n\\Phi(s)=P_{11}+\\,P_{12}K(s)[I\\,-\\,P_{22}K(s)]^{-1}P_{21}\n$$  \n\n# EXAMPLE 10–15  \n\nLet us determine the $P$ matrix in the generalized plant diagram of the control system considered in Example 10–14.

The system comprises three inputs:\n\n*   **Input $z_1$:** This input is connected to the first element of matrix $\\mathbf{W}_s$, denoted as $w_{11}$.\n*   **Input $z_2$:** This input is connected to the second element of matrix $\\mathbf{W}_s$, denoted as $w_{21}$.\n*   **Input $u$:** This input is not directly connected to any elements in matrices $\\mathbf{W}_m$ or $\\mathbf{W}_s$. Instead, it affects the output through an external feedback loop.\n\nThe system also includes two outputs:\n\n*   **Output $y$:** This output corresponds to the first element of matrix $\\mathbf{K}$.\n*   **Output $w$:** This output is not directly connected to any elements in matrices $\\mathbf{W}_m$ or $\\mathbf{W}_s$. Instead, it affects another input through an external feedback loop.\n\nThe system utilizes two matrices:\n\n*   **Matrix $\\mathbf{W}_s$:** This matrix contains elements $w_{11}$ and $w_{21}$ connected to the inputs. The output of the system is determined by multiplying the sum of $z_1$ and $z_2$ with their respective weights.\n*   **Matrix $\\mathbf{K}:** This matrix corresponds directly to the output $y$. Its value determines the magnitude of this output.\n\nIn summary, this block diagram illustrates a simple signal processing system that combines two inputs using weights from matrices $\\mathbf{W}_s$ and generates an output based on a single parameter from matrix $\\mathbf{K}$. 10–47 Generalized plant of the system discussed in Example 10–15.  \n\nIf both the robust stability and robust performance conditions are required, the control system must satisfy the condition given by Inequality (10–127), rewritten as  \n\n$$\n\\left|{{W_{m}}\\,\\frac{K G}{1\\,+\\,K G}}\\right|}<1\n$$  \n\nFor the $P$ matrix, we combine Equations (10–133) and (10–131) and get  \n\n$$\nP\\,=\\,{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{W_{s}}&{-W_{s}G}\\\\ {0}&{W_{m}G}\\\\ {I}&{-G}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nIf we construct $P(s)$ as given by Equation (10–135), then the problem of designing a control system to satisfy both robust stability and robust performance conditions can be formulated by using the generalized plant represented by Equation (10–135). As mentioned earlier, such a problem is called a mixed-sensitivity problem. By using the generalized plant given by Equation (10–135) we are able to determine the controller $K(s)$ that satisfies Inequality (10–134). The generalized plant diagram for the system considered in Example 10–14 becomes as shown in Figure 10–47.  \n\nHInfinity Control Problem. To design a controller $K$ of a control system to satisfy various stability and performance specifications, we utilize the concept of the generalized plant.  \n\nAs mentioned earlier a generalized plant is a linear model consisting of a model of the plant and weighting functions corresponding to the specifications for the required performance. Referring to the generalized plant shown in Figure 10–48, the $H$ infinity control problem is a problem to design a controller $K$ that will make the $H_{\\infty}$ norm of the transfer function from the exogenous disturbance $_w$ to the controlled variable $z$ less than a specified value.  \n\nThe image depicts a block diagram of a control system, specifically illustrating a generalized plant with input and output signals. The diagram is presented on a white background.\n\n*   A large rectangle represents the \"Generalized Plant.\"\n    *   It has two arrows pointing towards it: one labeled \"u\" (input) and another labeled \"y\" (output).\n    *   Another arrow points away from it, labeled as \"z\".\n*   Below the Generalized Plant is a smaller rectangle with an \"K\" inside it.\n    *   An arrow connects this to the Generalized Plant, indicating that the output of this component is fed back into the plant.\n*   The entire diagram is enclosed within two thicker rectangles, with arrows pointing inward from both sides. These are labeled as \"u\" and \"y\".\n*   The arrows connecting the different components are all solid black lines.\n\nThis block diagram illustrates a basic feedback control system where the output of the generalized plant is fed back to it through a controller represented by the smaller rectangle below the Generalized Plant. 10–48 A generalized plant diagram.  \n\nThe reason to use generalized plants, rather than individual block diagrams of control systems, is that a number of control systems with uncertain elements have been designed using generalized plants and, consequently, established design approaches using such plants are available.  \n\nNote that any weighting function, such as $W(s)$ , is an important parameter to influence the resulting controller $K(s)$ . In fact, the goodness of the resulting designed system depends on the choice of the weighting function or functions used in the design process.  \n\nNote that the controller that is the solution to the $H$ infinity control problem is commonly called the $H$ infinity controller.  \n\nSolving Robust Control Problems. There are three established approaches to solve robust control problems.They are  \n\n1 . Solve robust control problems by deriving the Riccati equations and solving them. 2. Solve robust control problems by using the linear matrix inequality approach. 3. Solve robust control problems that involve structural uncertainties by using the $\\mu$ analysis and $\\mu$ synthesis approach.  \n\nSolving robust control problems by use of any of the above methods requires a broad mathematical background.  \n\nIn this section we have presented only an introduction to the robust control theory. Solving any robust control problem requires mathematical background beyond the scope of the senior engineering student. Therefore, an interested reader may take a graduate-level control course at an established college or university and study this subject in detail.  \n\n# EXAMPLE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS  \n\nA–10–1.

It then uses the \"acker\" function to compute the Ackermann function for matrix A and vector B, storing the result in variable K. The same process is applied to compute Ke using matrices A' (the transpose of A), C, and L'. Finally, the code prints out the values of K and Ke.\n\nIn summary, the image displays a MATLAB program designed to obtain matrices K and Ke through the use of the \"acker\" function.

It also decreases with frequency but remains above System 1's curve throughout.\n\n**Bottom Plot: Phase Response**\n\n*   **Frequency Range:** Same as the top plot (10^-1 to 10^2 Hz)\n*   **System Responses:**\n    *   **System 1:** The phase begins at around -180 degrees and decreases gradually with increasing frequency, reaching about -300 degrees at the highest frequency.\n    *   **System 2:** It starts slightly lower than System 1, beginning at approximately -185 degrees. Similar to its magnitude response, it decreases with frequency but stays above System 1's curve throughout.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   Both systems exhibit a decrease in magnitude and phase shift as the frequency increases.\n*   System 2 generally has a higher magnitude than System 1 across all frequencies but follows a similar trend.\n*   The phase responses of both systems are complementary to their magnitude responses, with the phase decreasing as the magnitude decreases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph illustrates the frequency response characteristics of two systems, highlighting differences in their magnitude and phase responses. Understanding these behaviors is crucial for system design and analysis in various fields such as signal processing, control theory, and electrical engineering.  \nFrequency (rad/sec)  \n\nThe observer controller is clearly a lead compensator.  \n\nThe Bode diagrams of System 1 (closed-loop system with full-order observer) and of System 2 (closed-loop system with minimum-order observer) are shown in Figure 10–54.

The program is titled \"MATLAB Program 10-35\" and has a light gray background with black text.\n\n*   The program starts with a line of code that reads \"% Unit-step response,\" indicating that the program is designed to generate a unit step response.\n*   Below this, there are several lines of code that define variables and functions. These include:\n    *   `A = [0 1 0; 20.601 0 0; -0.4905 0 0];`: This line defines a matrix A with three rows and three columns.\n    *   `B = [-1;-1;-0.5];`: This line defines a vector B with three elements.\n    *   `C = [0 1 0];`: This line defines another matrix C with three rows and one column.\n    *   `D = [0];`: This line defines a scalar D equal to zero.\n*   The next section of code calculates the eigenvalues of the matrices A and B using the following lines:\n    *   `K = [-188.0799 -37.0738 -26.6767 -30.5824];`\n    *   `kl = -10.0000;`\n*   The final section of code generates a unit step response using the following lines:\n    *   `AA = [A-B*K B*kl;-C 0];`\n    *   `BB = [0;0;1];`\n    *   `CC = [C;0];`\n\nOverall, the program appears to be designed to analyze and visualize the unit step response of a system defined by the matrices A, B, C, and D. The use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors suggests that the program is intended for linear systems analysis.  \n\nnotice that the response of the present system is less oscillatory and exhibits less maximum Comparing the step-response characteristics of this system with those of Example 10–5, we A Bovershoot in the position response $x_{3}$ versus $t$ .

The functions are plotted against time (t) on the x-axis and an unspecified variable (y) on the y-axis.\n\n*   **Graph 1**\n    *   The first graph features a single peak at approximately t = 0.5 seconds.\n    *   The function value at this peak is around y = 0.02.\n    *   There are no other notable peaks or troughs in this graph.\n*   **Graph 2**\n    *   This graph exhibits a single minimum point at about t = 1 second.\n    *   The corresponding function value is roughly -0.05.\n    *   Similar to Graph 1, there are no significant maxima or minima outside of these points.\n*   **Graph 3**\n    *   In this graph, the function starts below y = 0 and gradually increases until reaching a maximum value slightly above y = 1 at around t = 2 seconds.\n    *   After peaking, the function decreases and crosses the y-axis again before ending near y = 0 at approximately t = 10 seconds.\n*   **Graph 4**\n    *   This graph displays a similar pattern to Graph 3 but with a different magnitude and timing for its peak.\n    *   The maximum value in this graph occurs closer to t = 1 second, where the function value is just above y = 0.5.\n    *   Like Graph 3, it eventually returns close to y = 0 by t = 10 seconds.\n*   **Graph 5**\n    *   This graph shows a gradual increase in the function from below y = 0 at the start up to around y = 2.9 at its peak near t = 4 seconds.\n    *   Following this, the function decreases and crosses the y-axis once before reaching zero again by the end of the time interval.\n\nIn summary, all five graphs exhibit single-peaked or single-valleyed functions with varying magnitudes and times for their maxima or minima. They generally follow a similar pattern but differ in their specifics regarding the timing and magnitude of these peaks or troughs. 10–55 Response curves to a unit-step input.  \n\nThe image presents a graph with the title \"Cart Position x3 versus t\" at the top, set against a white background.

The line is smooth and continuous throughout its range.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   The x-axis represents time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 10.\n*   The y-axis represents the cart position x3, ranging from -0.2 to 1.2.\n*   A single curve is plotted on the graph, showing a smooth and continuous relationship between time and cart position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe graph illustrates the variation of cart position x3 over time, with the cart starting at a negative value and ending at a positive value after 10 seconds. The smooth and continuous nature of the curve suggests that the cart's movement is consistent and predictable throughout the observed period. 10–56 Cart position versus tcurve.   \nA–10–18.

Let us obtain the transfer function between point $A$ and point $B$ in Figure 10–57(a). Redrawing Figure 10–57(a), we obtain Figure 10–57(b).Then the transfer function between points $A$ and $B$ can be obtained as  \n\n$$\n\\frac{K}{1\\,+\\,G K}\\,=\\,K(1\\,+\\,G K)^{-1}\n$$  \n\nDefine  \n\n$$\nK(1\\,+\\,G K)^{-1}\\,=\\,T_{a}\n$$  \n\nThen Figure 10–57(b) can be redrawn as Figure 10–57(c).By using the small-gain theorem,the condition for the robust stability of the closed-loop system can be obtained as  \n\n$$\n\\|\\Delta_{a}T_{a}\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nSince it is impossible to model $\\Delta_{a}$ precisely, we need to find a scalar transfer function $W_{a}(j\\omega)$ such that  \n\n$$\n\\overline{{{\\sigma}}}\\{\\Delta_{a}(j\\omega)\\}\\,<\\,|W_{a}(j\\omega)|\\quad\\mathrm{~for~all~}\\omega\n$$  \n\nand use this $W_{a}(j\\omega)$ instead of $\\Delta_{a}$ . Then, the condition for the robust stability of the closed-loop system can be given by  \n\n$$\n\\|W_{a}T_{a}\\|_{\\infty}<1\n$$  \n\nIf Inequality (10–181) holds true, then it is evident that Inequality (10–180) also holds true. So this is the condition to guarantee the robust stability of the designed system. In Figure 10–57(e), $\\Delta_{a}$ in Figure 10–57(d) was replaced by $W_{a}I$ .  \n\nTo summarize, if we make the $H_{\\infty}$ norm of the transfer function from $w$ to $z$ to be less than 1, the controller $K$ that satisfies Inequality (10–181) can be determined.

The chart is divided into two main sections: the top section focuses on input processing, while the bottom section deals with output generation.\n\n**Top Section: Input Processing**\n\n*   **Input Signal**: The flowchart begins with an input signal represented by a box labeled \"r\" at the top left corner.\n    *   This signal is fed into a series of operations that transform it into a processed form.\n*   **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Removal**: An arrow points to a box containing the symbol \"+,\" indicating that AWGN removal is performed on the input signal. The result is represented by another box labeled \"k1.\"\n    *   This step likely involves applying filters or algorithms to reduce noise in the input signal.\n*   **Gain Adjustment**: A third box, labeled \"k2,\" shows a gain adjustment being applied to the output of AWGN removal.\n    *   This may involve amplifying or attenuating the signal based on specific requirements.\n\n**Middle Section: Signal Processing**\n\n*   **Multiplication Operation**: An arrow connects the gain-adjusted signal to a multiplication operation represented by a box labeled \"k3.\"\n    *   This step combines the input signal with another signal or parameter, potentially adjusting its amplitude or phase.\n*   **Integration**: A subsequent box contains the symbol \"∫,\" indicating integration is performed on the output of the multiplication operation.\n    *   Integration likely involves calculating the area under a curve or summing values over time.\n\n**Bottom Section: Output Generation**\n\n*   **Output Signal**: The final step produces an output signal represented by a box labeled \"y\" at the bottom right corner.\n    *   This signal is generated based on the processed input signal and integrated result.\n*   **Feedback Loop**: A feedback loop connects the output signal back to the input, creating a closed-loop system.\n    *   This allows for continuous monitoring and adjustment of the system's performance.\n\nIn summary, the flowchart outlines a signal processing pipeline that involves AWGN removal, gain adjustment, multiplication, integration, and finally generates an output signal. The feedback loop enables real-time adaptation and optimization of the system's response to changing conditions.  \n\nB–10–9.

The system is subjected to an external force that causes it to move in a specific manner.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n*   **Mass:** A circular object attached to the end of the spring.\n*   **Spring:** A flexible rod connecting the mass to a fixed point on the x-axis, allowing for horizontal motion.\n*   **Pendulum:** A long rod pivoting at one end and connected to the mass, enabling vertical motion.\n*   **Fixed Point:** A point on the x-axis where the spring is anchored.\n*   **External Force:** An arrow pointing towards the right, indicating a force applied to the system.\n\n**Motion Description:**\n\nThe external force causes the mass to move along the x-axis while the pendulum oscillates vertically. The motion of the pendulum creates a cyclical movement as it swings back and forth about its pivot point.\n\n**Equations of Motion:**\n\nTo describe the motion of this complex system, we would need to derive two separate equations of motion:\n\n1.  **Horizontal Equation:** Describing the horizontal motion of the mass due to the spring force and external force.\n2.  **Vertical Equation:** Describing the vertical oscillation of the pendulum.\n\nThese equations would involve the masses involved (both the point mass and the pendulum), their velocities, accelerations, and the forces acting upon them (spring force, gravity, and external force).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe image illustrates a dynamic mechanical system with both horizontal and vertical motion components. Analyzing this system requires considering the interactions between these components and deriving equations of motion to predict its behavior under various conditions.  \n\nFigure 10–59 Inverted-pendulum system.  \n\nB–10–10.

This signal serves as the reference or setpoint for the control system.\n*   **Multiplier**: The multiplier is denoted by a circle with an \"x\" symbol inside it. It multiplies the input signal by the value of 5, amplifying the signal and preparing it for further processing.\n*   **Additive Node**: The additive node is represented by a box containing the symbol \"+\". Here, the amplified signal from the multiplier is added to another signal, which is not explicitly shown in the diagram. This addition combines the two signals, creating a new output that will be used in subsequent calculations.\n*   **Denominator (s+1)**: The denominator represents a component of the transfer function of the system. It consists of a single pole at s= -1, indicating that the system has one zero in its frequency response.\n*   **Numerator (2s+1)**: The numerator is another part of the transfer function and contains two poles at s = -0.5 and s = -1. This suggests that the system has two zeros in its frequency response, affecting how it responds to different frequencies.\n*   **Output Signal (u)**: The output signal is represented by an arrow pointing away from the rightmost component of the diagram. This signal is the result of the combined effects of the input, multiplier, additive node, and transfer function.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   The system has a single pole in its denominator and two zeros in its numerator, which influences its frequency response.\n*   The presence of an additive node allows for the combination of signals from different sources or components within the system.\n*   The output signal (u) is generated based on the processed input signal (r), taking into account the effects of the multiplier, additive node, and transfer function.\n\nOverall, this block diagram illustrates a control system designed to regulate and optimize its behavior in response to changes in the input signal.

The magnitude of A B$G(s)$ is $\\sqrt{G_{x}^{2}+G_{y}^{2}}$ ,and the angle $\\theta$ of $G(s)$ is $\\tan^{-1}\\!\\left(G_{y}/\\hat{G}_{x}\\right)\\!.$ .The angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive real axis.The complex conjugate of $G(s)$ is $\\bar{G}(s)\\,=\\,G_{x}\\,-\\,j G_{y}$ .  \n\nComplex functions commonly encountered in linear control systems analysis are single-valued functions of $s$ and are uniquely determined for a given value of $s$ .  \n\nA complex function $G(s)$ is said to be analytic in a region if $G(s)$ and all its derivatives exist in that region.The derivative of an analytic function $G(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d}{d s}}\\,G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\Delta s\\to0}{\\frac{G(s\\,+\\,\\Delta s)\\,-\\,G(s)}{\\Delta s}}=\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\Delta s\\to0}{\\frac{\\Delta G}{\\Delta s}}\n$$  \n\nSince $\\Delta s\\,=\\,\\Delta\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\Delta\\omega,\\,\\Delta s$ can approach zero along an infinite number of different paths. It can be shown, but is stated without a proof here, that if the derivatives taken along two particular paths, that is, $\\Delta s\\,=\\,\\Delta\\sigma$ and $\\Delta s=j\\Delta\\omega$ ,are equal, then the derivative is unique for any other path $\\Delta s\\,=\\,\\Delta\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\Delta\\omega$ and so the derivative exists.  \n\nFor a particular path $\\Delta s\\,=\\,\\Delta\\sigma$ (which means that the path is parallel to the real axis),  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d}{d s}}\\,G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{\\Delta\\sigma\\rightarrow0}\\left({\\frac{\\Delta G_{x}}{\\Delta\\sigma}}+\\,j\\,{\\frac{\\Delta G_{y}}{\\Delta\\sigma}}\\right)\\,=\\,{\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\sigma}}\\,+\\,j\\,{\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\sigma}}\n$$  \n\nFor another particular path $\\Delta s=j\\Delta\\omega$ (which means that the path is parallel to the imaginary axis),  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{d}{d s}}G(s)\\,=\\,\\operatorname*{lim}_{j\\Delta\\omega\\to0}\\!\\left({\\frac{\\Delta G_{x}}{j\\Delta\\omega}}+\\,j\\,{\\frac{\\Delta G_{y}}{j\\Delta\\omega}}\\right)\\,=\\,-j\\,{\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\omega}}\\,+\\,{\\frac{\\Delta G_{y}}{\\partial\\omega}}\n$$  \n\nIf these two values of the derivative are equal,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\sigma}+\\,j\\,\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\sigma}=\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\omega}-\\,j\\,\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\omega}\n$$  \n\nor if the following two conditions  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\sigma}}={\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\omega}}\\qquad{\\mathrm{and}}\\qquad{\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\sigma}}=-\\,{\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\omega}}\n$$  \n\nare satisfied,then the derivative $d G\\left(s\\right)/d s$ is uniquely determined.These two conditions are known as the Cauchy–Riemann conditions.If these conditions are satisfied,the function $G(s)$ is analytic.  \n\nAs an example, consider the following $G(s)$ :  \n\n$$\nG(s)={\\frac{1}{s+1}}\n$$  \n\nThen  \n\n$$\nG(\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega)\\,=\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega\\,+\\,1}=G_{x}\\,+\\,j G_{y}\n$$  \n\nwhere  \n\n$$\nG_{x}=\\frac{\\sigma\\,+\\,1}{(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}}\\qquad\\mathrm{and}\\qquad G_{y}=\\frac{-\\omega}{(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}}\n$$  \n\nIt can be seen that, except at $s=-1$ (that is, $\\sigma=-1$ ,$\\omega\\,=\\,0$ ),$G(s)$ satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann conditions:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\sigma}=\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\omega}=\\frac{\\omega^{2}\\,-\\,(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)^{2}}{\\left[(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}\\right]^{2}}\\,\\ }\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\sigma}=-\\,\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\omega}=\\frac{2\\omega(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)}{\\left[(\\sigma\\,+\\,1)^{2}\\,+\\,\\omega^{2}\\right]^{2}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence $G(s)\\,=\\,1/(s\\,+\\,1)$ is analytic in the entire $s$ plane except at $s\\,=\\,-1.$ .The derivative $d G\\left(s\\right)/\\left.d s$ , except at $s=1$ , is found to be  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{\\displaystyle{\\frac{d}{d s}G(s)=\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{\\partial\\sigma}+j\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\sigma}=\\frac{\\partial G_{y}}{\\partial\\omega}-j\\frac{\\partial G_{x}}{d\\omega}}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle{=-\\,\\frac{1}{(\\sigma\\,+\\,j\\omega\\,+\\,1)^{2}}=-\\,\\frac{1}{(s\\,+\\,1)^{2}}}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nNote that the derivative of an analytic function can be obtained simply by differentiating $G(s)$ with respect to $s$ . In this example,  \n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d s}\\left(\\frac1{s\\,+\\,1}\\right)\\,=\\,-\\,\\frac1{(s\\,+\\,1)^{2}}\n$$  \n\nPoints in the $s$ plane at which the function $G(s)$ is analytic are called ordinary points, while points in the $s$ plane at which the function $G(s)$ is not analytic are called singular points. Singular points at which the function $G(s)$ or its derivatives approach infinity are called poles . Singular points at which the function $G(s)$ equals zero are called zeros .  \n\nIf $G(s)$ approaches infinity as $s$ approaches $-p$ and if the function  \n\n$$\nG(s)(s\\,+\\,p)^{n},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,n=1,2,3,\\ldots\n$$  \n\nhas a finite, nonzero value at $s=-p$ , then $s=-p$ is called a pole of order $n$ . If $n=1$ ,the pole is called a simple pole. If $n\\,=\\,2,3,\\ldots$ , the pole is called a second-order pole, a third-order pole, and so on.  \n\nTo illustrate, consider the complex function  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,2)(s\\,+\\,10)}{s(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,5)(s\\,+\\,15)^{2}}\n$$  \n\n$G(s)$ has zeros at $s\\,=-2$ ,$s=-10$ , simple poles at $s\\,=\\,0,s\\,=-1,s\\,=-5$ , and a double pole (multiple pole of order 2) at $s\\,=\\,-15.$ Note that $G(s)$ becomes zero at $s=\\infty$ . Since for large values of $s$  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\div{\\frac{K}{s^{3}}}\n$$  \n\n$G(s)$ possesses a triple zero (multiple zero of order 3) at $s=\\infty,$ . If points at infinity are included, $G(s)$ has the same number of poles as zeros.To summarize, $G(s)$ has five zeros $[s=-2$ ,$s=-10$ ,$s=\\infty$ ,$s=\\infty$ ,$s=\\infty$ )and five poles $(s\\,=\\,0,\\,s\\,=\\,-1,\\,s\\,=\\,-5$ ,$s=-15,s=-15)$ .  \n\nLaplace Transformation. Let us define  \n\n$f(t)=$ a function of time $t$ such that $f(t)\\,=\\,0$ for $t<0$ $s=$ a complex variable $\\mathcal{L}=$ an operational symbol indicating that the quantity that it prefixes is to be transformed by the Laplace integral $\\textstyle\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\!e^{-s t}\\,d t$   \n$F(s)=$ Laplace transform of $f(t)$  \n\nThen the Laplace transform of $f(t)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\mathcal{L}}\\!\\left[f(t)\\right]=F(s)=\\,\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\!\\!e^{-s t}\\,d t\\!\\left[f(t)\\right]=\\,\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\!\\!f(t)e^{-s t}\\,d t\n$$  \n\nThe reverse process of finding the time function $f(t)$ from the Laplace transform $F(s)$ is called the inverse Laplace transformation .The notation for the inverse Laplace transformation is $\\mathcal{L}^{-1}$ , and the inverse Laplace transform can be found from $F(s)$ by the following inversion integral:  \n\n$$\n{\\mathcal{L}}^{-1}{\\big[}F(s){\\big]}=f(t)={\\frac{1}{2\\pi j}}\\int_{c-j\\infty}^{c+j\\infty}F(s)e^{s t}\\,d s,\\qquad{\\mathrm{for~}}t>0\n$$  \n\nwhere $c$ , the abscissa of convergence, is a real constant and is chosen larger than the real parts of all singular points of $F(s)$ .Thus, the path of integration is parallel to the $j\\omega$ axis and is displaced by the amount $c$ from it.This path of integration is to the right of all singular points.  \n\nEvaluating the inversion integral appears complicated.In practice,we seldom use this integral for finding $f(t)$ .We frequently use the partial-fraction expansion method given in Appendix B.  \n\nIn what follows we give Table A–1, which presents Laplace transform pairs of commonly encountered functions, and Table A–2, which presents properties of Laplace transforms.  \n\nTable A–1 Laplace Transform Pairs Table A–1 (continued )  \n\nThe image presents a table with 17 rows and two columns, labeled \"f(t)\" and \"F(s)\".

Consider $F(s)$ written in the factored form  \n\n$$\nF(s)\\,=\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}=\\frac{K(s\\,+\\,z_{1})(s\\,+\\,z_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,z_{m})}{(s\\,+\\,p_{1})(s\\,+\\,p_{2})\\cdots(s\\,+\\,p_{n})},\\qquad\\mathrm{for}\\,m<n\n$$  \n\nwhere $p_{1},p_{2},\\ldots,p_{n}$ and $z_{1},z_{2},\\dots,z_{m}$ are either real or complex quantities,but for each complex $p_{i}$ or $z_{j}$ there will occur the complex conjugate of $p_{i}$ or $z_{j}$ ,respectively.If $F(s)$ involves distinct poles only,then it can be expanded into a sum of simple partial fractions as follows:  \n\n$$\nF(s)={\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}={\\frac{a_{1}}{s\\,+\\,p_{1}}}+{\\frac{a_{2}}{s\\,+\\,p_{2}}}+\\cdots+{\\frac{a_{n}}{s\\,+\\,p_{n}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{k}\\,(k=1,2,\\dots,n)$ are constants.The coefficient $a_{k}$ is called the residue at the pole at $s=-p_{k}$ . The value of $a_{k}$ can be found by multiplying both sides of Equation (B–1) by $\\left(s+\\ p_{k}\\right)$ and letting $s=-p_{k}$ , which gives  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l l}{\\displaystyle\\left(s\\,+\\,p_{k}\\right)\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}\\Bigg]_{s=-p_{k}}=\\Bigg[\\frac{a_{1}}{s\\,+\\,p_{1}}\\big(s\\,+\\,p_{k}\\big)+\\frac{a_{2}}{s\\,+\\,p_{2}}\\big(s\\,+\\,p_{k}\\big)}&{\\quad s\\,+\\,p_{k}}\\\\ {\\displaystyle\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad+\\,\\cdots+\\frac{a_{k}}{s\\,+\\,p_{k}}\\big(s\\,+\\,p_{k}\\big)+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n}}{s\\,+\\,p_{n}}\\big(s\\,+\\,p_{k}\\big)\\Bigg]}&{{}=\\displaystyle\\,a_{k}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nWe see that all the expanded terms drop out with the exception of $a_{k}$ .Thus the residue $a_{k}$ is found from  \n\n$$\na_{k}=\\left[\\left(s\\,+\\,p_{k}\\right)\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}\\right]_{s=-p_{k}}\n$$  \n\nNote that, since $f(t)$ is a real function of time, if $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are complex conjugates, then the residues $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are also complex conjugates. Only one of the conjugates, $a_{1}$ or $a_{2}$ ,needs to be evaluated, because the other is known automatically.  \n\nSince  \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{a_{k}}{s\\,+\\,p_{k}}\\bigg]\\,=\\,a_{k}e^{-p_{k}t}\n$$  \n\n$f(t)$ is obtained as  \n\n$$\nf(t)={\\mathcal{L}}^{-1}{\\big[}F(s){\\big]}=a_{1}e^{-p_{1}t}+a_{2}e^{-p_{2}t}+\\cdots+\\,a_{n}e^{-p_{n}t},\\qquad{\\mathrm{for~}}t\\geq0\n$$  \n\nEXAMPLE B–1 Find the inverse Laplace transform of  \n\n$$\nF(s)=\\frac{s+3}{(s+1)(s+2)}\n$$  \n\nThe partial-fraction expansion of $F(s)$ is  \n\n$$\nF(s)={\\frac{s\\,+\\,3}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}={\\frac{a_{1}}{s\\,+\\,1}}+{\\frac{a_{2}}{s\\,+\\,2}}\n$$  \n\nwhere $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are found as  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}&{a_{1}=\\left[(s\\,+\\,1)\\,{\\cfrac{s\\,+\\,3}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}\\right]_{s=-1}=\\left[{\\cfrac{s\\,+\\,3}{s\\,+\\,2}}\\right]_{s=-1}=2}\\\\ &{a_{2}=\\left[(s\\,+\\,2)\\,{\\cfrac{s\\,+\\,3}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}}\\right]_{s=-2}=\\left[{\\cfrac{s\\,+\\,3}{s\\,+\\,1}}\\right]_{s=-2}=-1}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nThus  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle f(t)\\,=\\,\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\big[F(s)\\big]}}\\\\ {{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,=\\,\\,\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{2}{s\\,+\\,1}\\bigg]\\,+\\,\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\bigg[\\frac{-1}{s\\,+\\,2}\\bigg]}}\\\\ {{\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,=\\,2e^{-t}\\,-\\,e^{-2t},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{for}\\,t\\geq0}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nEXAMPLE B–2 Obtain the inverse Laplace transform of  \n\n$$\nG(s)=\\frac{s^{3}+5s^{2}+9s+7}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nHere, since the degree of the numerator polynomial is higher than that of the denominator polynomial, we must divide the numerator by the denominator.  \n\n$$\nG(s)\\,=\\,s\\,+\\,2\\,+\\frac{s\\,+\\,3}{(s\\,+\\,1)(s\\,+\\,2)}\n$$  \n\nNote that the Laplace transform of the unit-impulse function $\\delta(t)$ is 1 and that the Laplace transform of $d\\delta(t)/d t$ is $s$ .The third term on the right-hand side of this last equation is $F(s)$ in Example B–1.

Consider the following function $B(s)/A(s)$ :  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}={\\frac{\\mathrm{num}}{\\mathrm{den}}}={\\frac{b_{0}s^{n}+b_{1}s^{n-1}+\\cdots+b_{n}}{s^{n}+a_{1}s^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n}}}\n$$  \n\nwhere some of $a_{i}$ and $b_{j}$ may be zero. In MATLAB row vectors num and den specify the coefficients of the numerator and denominator of the transfer function.That is,  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\mathsf{n u m}}=[\\mathsf{b}_{0}\\ \\mathsf{\\ b}_{1}\\ \\dots\\ \\mathsf{b}_{\\mathsf{n}}]}\\\\ {{\\mathsf{d e n}}=[1\\ \\ \\mathsf{a}_{1}\\ \\ \\dots\\ \\mathsf{a}_{\\mathsf{n}}]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe command  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{r},\\mathsf{p},\\mathsf{k}]=\\mathsf{r e s i d u e}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})\n$$  \n\nfinds the residues ( r), poles ( p), and direct terms ( k) of a partial-fraction expansion of the ratio of two polynomials $B(s)$ and $A(s)$ .  \n\nThe partial-fraction expansion of $B(s)/A(s)$ is given by  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}={\\frac{r(1)}{s\\,-\\,p(1)}}+{\\frac{r(2)}{s\\,-\\,p(2)}}+\\cdots+{\\frac{r(n)}{s\\,-\\,p(n)}}+\\,k(s)\n$$  \n\nComparing Equations (B–1) and (B–4), we note that $p(1)\\,=\\,-p_{1}$ ,$p(2)\\,=\\,-p_{2},\\ldots$ ,$p(n)=-p_{n};r(1)=a_{1},r(2)=a_{2},\\ldots,r(n)=a_{n}.\\left[k(s)\\right]$ is a direct term.]  \n\nEXAMPLE B–4 Consider the following transfer function,  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}={\\frac{2s^{3}+5s^{2}+3s+6}{s^{3}+6s^{2}+11s+6}}\n$$  \n\nFor this function,  \n\n$\\mathrm{den}=[1\\ \\ 6\\ \\ 1\\ \\ 6]$  \n\nThe command  \n\ngives the following result:  \n\nThis image presents a mathematical representation of a vector equation, comprising three lines.\n\nThe first line defines two variables: [r, p, k] = residue(num, den), denoting that the values of r, p, and k are determined by a function named \"residue\" with input parameters \"num\" and \"den.\" This indicates that the solution is obtained through the evaluation of this function.\n\nThe second line displays three equations: r = -6.0000, p = -3.0000, and k = 2.00. These values represent the numerical results for the variables r, p, and k.\n\nThe third line is blank, suggesting that it may be intended to display additional information or an error message but remains empty in this instance.  \n\n(Note that the residues are returned in column vector r, the pole locations in column vector p, and the direct term in row vector $\\mathrm{k}.$ .) This is the MATLAB representation of the following partialfraction expansion of $B(s)/A(s)$ :  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}=\\frac{2s^{3}\\,+\\,5s^{2}\\,+\\,3s\\,+\\,6}{s^{3}\\,+\\,6s^{2}\\,+\\,11s\\,+\\,6}}}\\\\ {{{}}}\\\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{-6}{s\\,+\\,3}+\\frac{-4}{s\\,+\\,2}+\\frac{3}{s\\,+\\,1}+\\,2}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nthat if $p(j)\\,=\\,p(j\\,+\\,1)\\,=\\,\\cdots\\,=\\,p(j\\,+\\,m\\,-\\,1)$ that is, $p_{j}=p_{j+1}=\\cdots=p_{j+m-1}\\!\\Big]$ the pole $p(j)$ is a pole of multiplicity m. In such a case, the expansion includes terms of the form  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{r(j)}{s\\,-\\,p(j)}}+{\\frac{r(j+1)}{\\left[s\\,-\\,p(j)\\right]^{2}}}+\\cdots+{\\frac{r(j\\,+\\,m\\,-\\,1)}{\\left[s\\,-\\,p(j)\\right]^{m}}}\n$$  \n\nFor details, see Example B–5.  \n\n# EXAMPLE B–5 Expand the following $B(s)/A(s)$ into partial fractions with MATLAB.  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}}={\\frac{s^{2}+2s+3}{(s+1)^{3}}}={\\frac{s^{2}+2s+3}{s^{3}+3s^{2}+3s+1}}\n$$  \n\nFor this function, we have  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{\\mathsf{n u m}=\\left[1\\ \\ 2\\ \\ 3\\right]}\\\\ {\\mathsf{d e n}=\\left[1\\ \\ 3\\ \\ 3\\ \\ 1\\right]}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nThe command  \n\n$$\n[\\mathsf{r},\\mathsf{p},\\mathsf{k}]=\\mathsf{r e s i d u e}(\\mathsf{n u m},\\mathsf{d e n})\n$$  \n\ngives the result shown next:  \n\nIt is the MATLAB representation of the following partial-fraction expansion of $B(s)/A(s)$ :  \n\n$$\n\\frac{B(s)}{A(s)}=\\frac{1}{s\\,+\\,1}+\\frac{0}{(s\\,+\\,1)^{2}}+\\frac{2}{(s\\,+\\,1)^{3}}\n$$  \n\nNote that the direct term $\\mathsf{k}$ is zero.  \n\n# Vector-Matrix Algebra  \n\nIn this appendix we first review the determinant of a matrix, then we define the adjoint matrix, the inverse of a matrix, and the derivative and integral of a matrix.  \n\nDeterminant of a Matrix. For each square matrix, there exists a determinant.The determinant of a square matrix A is usually written as $|\\mathbf{A}|$ or det A . The determinant has the following properties:  \n\n1. If any two consecutive rows or columns are interchanged,the determinant changes its sign.   \n2. If any row or any column consists only of zeros, then the value of the dererminant is zero.   \n3. If the elements of any row (or any column) are exactly $k$ times those of another row (or another column), then the value of the determinant is zero.   \n4. If, to any row (or any column), any constant times another row (or column) is added, the value of the determinant remains unchanged.   \n5. If a determinant is multiplied by a constant, then only one row (or one column) is multiplied by that constant. Note, however, that the determinant of $k$ times an $n\\times n$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is $k^{n}$ times the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ , or  \n\n$$\n\\left|k\\mathbf{A}\\right|=k^{n}\\big|\\mathbf{A}\\big|\n$$  \n\nThis is because  \n\n$$\nk\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c c c}{k a_{11}}&{k a_{12}}&{\\ldots}&{k a_{1m}}\\\\ {k a_{21}}&{k a_{22}}&{\\ldots}&{k a_{2m}}\\\\ {\\vdots}&{\\vdots}&{}&{\\vdots}\\\\ {k a_{n1}}&{k a_{n2}}&{\\ldots}&{k a_{n m}}\\end{array}\\right]\n$$  \n\n6. The determinant of the product of two square matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the product of determinants, or  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{AB}\\right|=\\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right|\\left|\\mathbf{B}\\right|\n$$  \n\nIf $\\mathbf{B}\\,=\\,n\\,\\times\\,m$ matrix and $\\mathbf{C}=m\\times n$ matrix, then  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{det}(\\mathbf{I}_{n}+\\,\\mathbf{BC})=\\operatorname*{det}(\\mathbf{I}_{m}+\\,\\mathbf{CB})\n$$  \n\nIf $\\mathbf A\\neq\\mathbf0$ and $\\mathbf{D}=m\\times m$ matrix, then  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{det}{\\left[\\!\\!{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\mathbf{A}}&{\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}}&{\\mathbf{D}}\\end{array}}\\right]}=\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{A}\\!\\cdot\\!\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{S}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{D}-\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}$ .If $\\mathbf{D}\\neq\\mathbf{0}$ , then  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathsf{d e t}\\overset{\\mathbf{\\Delta}\\mathbf{A}}{\\mathbf{C}}}&{{}\\mathbf{D}\\overset{\\mathbf{\\Delta}\\mathbf{\\top}}{=}\\mathsf{d e t}\\,\\mathbf{D}\\!\\cdot\\!\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{T}}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}=\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}-\\mathbf{\\Sigma}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\mathbf{C}$ .If $\\mathbf B=\\mathbf0$ or $\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{0}$ ,then  \n\n$$\n{\\begin{array}{r l}{\\operatorname*{det}{\\left[\\mathbf{A}\\right]}\\;}&{\\;\\mathbf{0}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{C}\\;}&{\\mathbf{D}}\\end{array}}=\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{D}}\\\\ {\\operatorname*{det}{\\left[\\mathbf{A}\\right]}\\;}&{\\;\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {\\operatorname*{det}{\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{\\mathbf{A}}&{\\mathbf{B}}\\\\ {\\mathbf{0}}&{\\mathbf{D}}\\end{array}\\right]}\\;=\\;\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\operatorname*{det}\\mathbf{D}}\\end{array}}\n$$  \n\nRank of Matrix. A matrix A is said to have rank $_m$ if there exists an $m\\times m$ sub  \nmatrix Mof A such that the determinant of Mis nonzero and the determinant of every   \n$r\\times r$ submatrix (where $r\\geq m\\,+\\,1)$ ) of $\\mathbf{A}$ is zero. As an example, consider the following matrix:  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l}{1}&{2}&{3}&{4}\\\\ {0}&{1}&{-1}&{0}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{1}&{2}\\\\ {1}&{1}&{0}&{2}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nNote that $|\\mathbf{A}|=0$ . One of a number of largest submatrices whose determinant is not equal to zero is  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\left[{1\\quad2\\quad\\quad3}\\,\\right]}\\\\ {\\mathrm{~0~}\\,1\\quad-1}\\\\ {\\mathrm{~1~}\\,0\\quad\\quad1}\\end{array}\n$$  \n\nHence, the rank of the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is 3.  \n\nMinor $M_{i j}.$ If the i th row and $j$ th column are deleted from an $n\\times n$ matrix A ,the resulting matrix is an $(n\\,-\\,1)\\,\\times\\,(n\\,-\\,1)$ matrix. The determinant of this $(n\\,-\\,1)\\times(n\\,-\\,1)$ matrix is called the minor $M_{i j}$ of the matrix A .  \n\nCofactor $A_{i j}.$ .The cofactor $A_{i j}$ of the element $a_{i j}$ of the $n\\times n$ matrix A is defined by the equation  \n\n$$\nA_{i j}\\,=\\,(-1)^{i+j}M_{i j}\n$$  \n\nThat is, the cofactor $A_{i j}$ of the element $a_{i j}$ is ${(-1)}^{i+j}$ times the determinant of the matrix formed by deleting the i th row and the $j$ th column from A . Note that the cofactor $A_{i j}$ of the element $a_{i j}$ is the coefficient of the term $a_{i j}$ in the expansion of the determinant $\\left\\lceil\\mathbf{A}\\right\\rceil$ ,since it can be shown that  \n\n$$\na_{i1}A_{i1}\\,+\\,a_{i2}A_{i2}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{i n}A_{i n}\\,=\\,\\left|{\\bf A}\\right|\n$$  \n\nIf $a_{i1},a_{i2},\\dots,a_{i n}$ are replaced by $a_{j1},a_{j2},\\dots,a_{j n}.$ ,then  \n\n$$\na_{j1}A_{i1}\\,+\\,a_{j2}A_{i2}\\,+\\,\\cdots\\,+\\,a_{j n}A_{i n}=0\\,\\qquad i\\ne j\n$$  \n\nbecause the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ in this case possesses two identical rows. Hence, we obtain  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{j k}A_{i k}\\,=\\,\\delta_{j i}\\big|{\\bf A}\\big|\n$$  \n\nSimilarly,  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k i}A_{k j}\\,=\\,\\delta_{i j}\\vert\\mathbf{A}\\vert\n$$  \n\nAdjoint Matrix .The matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ whose element in the i th row and $j$ th column equals $A_{j i}$ is called the adjoint of $\\mathbf{A}$ and is denoted by adj A , or  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}\\,=\\,(b_{i j})\\,=\\,(A_{j i})\\,=\\,{\\mathrm{adj}}\\ \\mathbf{A}\n$$  \n\nThat is, the adjoint of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the transpose of the matrix whose elements are the cofactors of $\\mathbf{A}$ , or  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname{adj}\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l}{A_{11}}&{A_{21}}&{\\dots}&{A_{n1}}\\\\ {A_{12}}&{A_{22}}&{\\dots}&{A_{n2}}\\\\ {\\vdots}&{\\vdots}&{}&{\\vdots}\\\\ {A_{1n}}&{A_{2n}}&{\\dots}&{A_{n m}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nNote that the element of the $j$ th row and $i$ th column of the product A (adj A )is  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{j k}b_{k i}=\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{j k}A_{i k}=\\delta_{j i}\\vert\\mathbf{A}\\vert\n$$  \n\nHence, A (adj A )is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements equal to $|\\mathbf{A}|$ , or  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A(adj\\,\\hat{A})}=\\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right|\\mathbf{I}\n$$  \n\nSimilarly, the element in the $j$ th row and i th column of the product (adj $\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{A}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n}b_{j k}a_{k i}=\\ \\sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{k j}a_{k i}=\\delta_{i j}\\vert\\mathbf{A}\\vert\n$$  \n\nHence, we have the relationship  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}(\\mathrm{adj}\\ \\mathbf{A})=(\\mathrm{adj}\\ \\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{A}=\\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right|\\mathbf{I}\n$$  \n\nThus  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}={\\frac{\\operatorname{adj}\\mathbf{A}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l}{{\\cfrac{A_{11}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}&{{\\cfrac{A_{21}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}&{\\dots}&{{\\cfrac{A_{n1}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}\\\\ {{\\cfrac{A_{12}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}&{{\\cfrac{A_{22}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}&{\\dots}&{{\\cfrac{A_{n2}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}\\\\ {\\vdots}&{\\vdots}&&{\\vdots}\\\\ {{\\cfrac{A_{1n}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}&{{\\cfrac{A_{2n}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}&{\\dots}&{{\\cfrac{A_{n n}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nwhere $A_{i j}$ is the cofactor of $a_{i j}$ of the matrix A .Thus, the terms in the i th column of ${\\mathbf{A}}^{-1}$ are $1/|\\mathbf{A}|$ times the cofactors of the i th row of the original matrix A . For example, if  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l r}{1}&{2}&{0}\\\\ {3}&{-1}&{-2}\\\\ {1}&{0}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nthen the adjoint of $\\mathbf{A}$ and the determinant $|\\mathbf{A}|$ are respectively found to be  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname{adj}\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l l l l}{-1}&{-2}\\\\ {0}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right]}\\,+\\,{\\overline{{\\left|2}\\begin{array}{l l}{\\quad0}&{0}\\\\ {0}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right|}}&{\\,\\,\\left|{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\,2}&{\\;\\,0}\\\\ {-1}&{-2}\\end{array}}\\right|}\\\\ {\\operatorname{adj}\\mathbf{A}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l}{3}&{-2}\\\\ {-{\\Big|}_{1}}&{-3}\\end{array}\\right]}}&{\\,\\,{\\Big|}1}&{\\,\\,0{\\Big|}}&{\\,\\,-{\\Big|}_{3}}&{\\,\\,0{\\Big|}}\\\\ {{\\Big|}3}&{-1}&{{-{\\Big|}_{1}}}&{\\,\\,{2}}&{\\,\\,{\\Big|}1}&{\\,\\,2{\\Big|}}\\\\ {{\\Big|}1}&{\\,\\,0{\\Big|}}&{\\,\\,-{\\Big|}1}&{\\,\\,0{\\Big|}}&{\\,{\\Big|}3}&{\\,\\,-1}\\end{array}\\right|}\n$$  \n\n$$\n=\\left[{\\begin{array}{r r r}{3}&{6}&{-4}\\\\ {7}&{-3}&{2}\\\\ {1}&{2}&{-7}\\end{array}}\\right]\n$$  \n\nand  \n\n$$\n\\left|\\mathbf{A}\\right|=17\n$$  \n\nHence, the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$ is  \n\n$$\n\\mathbf{A}^{-1}={\\frac{\\operatorname{adj}\\mathbf{A}}{|\\mathbf{A}|}}={\\left[\\begin{array}{l l l}{{\\frac{3}{17}}}&{{\\frac{6}{17}}}&{-{\\frac{4}{17}}}\\\\ {{\\frac{7}{17}}}&{-{\\frac{3}{17}}}&{{\\frac{2}{17}}}\\\\ {{\\frac{1}{17}}}&{{\\frac{2}{17}}}&{-{\\frac{7}{17}}}\\end{array}\\right]}\n$$  \n\nIn what follows, we give formulas for finding inverse matrices for the $2\\times2$ matrix and the $3\\times3$ matrix.

The bold font and dark gray color scheme create a striking visual effect, while the symmetrical lines and neutral background contribute to a sense of balance and harmony.  \n\n# References  \n\nA–1 Anderson, B.
