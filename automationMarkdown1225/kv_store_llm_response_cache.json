    "return": "The Nyquist Stability Criterion is a pivotal technique in control theory used for evaluating the stability of closed-loop control systems. This method relies on analyzing the open-loop frequency response, specifically focusing on the Nyquist plot, to determine the presence and number of encirclements around a critical point, typically -1+j0, on the complex plane. The Nyquist Stability Criterion utilizes the open-loop transfer function G(s)H(s) in the frequency domain to assess both absolute and relative stability.\n\nDeveloped by engineer and researcher Harry Nyquist, this graphical approach is foundational in control engineering. It provides insights into the stability of feedback systems by mapping the contours of open-loop frequency responses in polar coordinates. The technique is especially valuable in systems where transport lags and non-minimum-phase components may impact stability analysis, although caution must be exercised when applying it in these scenarios.\n\nThe procedure involves constructing a Nyquist plot from frequency response data, which visually represents the system's response in the complex plane.

Gain Margin is essentially a quantitative figure that indicates how much the gain in a control system can be increased before the system reaches instability, often represented in decibels (dB). It reflects the extent to which a system can tolerate gain variations without becoming unstable, providing an essential criterion for ensuring robust performance.\n\nGain Margin is evaluated in the frequency domain, typically through tools such as Bode plots or Nichols charts. In a Bode plot, it is depicted as the decibel difference between the actual gain at the phase crossover frequency and the gain that would lead to the verge of instability. This crossover frequency is where the phase of the open-loop transfer function crosses -180 degrees. As such, Gain Margin is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the open-loop transfer function at this phase crossover frequency. A higher Gain Margin indicates a greater stability margin, suggesting that the system can endure larger gain increases without destabilizing.\n\nFor design purposes, it is generally recommended for Gain Margin to be 10 dB or more, so the system remains sufficiently stable under typical variations and uncertainties. Systems with a Gain Margin of +∞ dB are considered highly stable, as they can theoretically tolerate an infinite increase in gain without reaching instability. Conversely, a negative Gain Margin signifies that the system is inherently unstable.\n\nIn summary, Gain Margin serves as a crucial metric in control systems, providing insight into how gain variations can impact the stability of the system.
